year ended december  net revenues gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses income loss before income taxes critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following accounting policies involve its more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable vicor maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments  based on assessments of customers credit risk profiles and payment histories 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories the company estimates allowances for its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon its known backlog and historical usage  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
long lived assets management evaluates the recoverability of the company s identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which generally requires that the recoverability of these assets be assessed when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the company periodically assesses the remaining use of fixed assets based upon operating results and cash flows from operations 
equipment has been written down as a result of these assessments as necessary 
a further decline in the company s business could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods 
warranty the company generally warrants its products for a period of two years 
vicor maintains allowances for estimated product returns under warranty based upon a review of known or potential product failures in the field and upon historical patterns of product returns 
if unforeseen product issues arise or product returns increase above expected rates  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   the company has deferred tax assets of approximately million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company has assessed the need for a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets and concluded that realization of these deferred tax assets is more likely than not and that no valuation allowance is warranted at december  in reaching this conclusion  the company evaluated all relevant criteria including the existence of temporary differences reversing in the carryforward period  primarily depreciation  and the ability to carryback net operating losses at december  based on these assessments  the company concluded no valuation allowance was warranted at december  valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets may be required in the future based on changes in the mix of temporary differences  changes in tax laws  and operating performance 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues for fiscal were  a decrease of  as compared to  for fiscal the decline in net revenues resulted primarily from a net decrease in unit shipments of standard and custom products of approximately  and a decrease in license revenue of approximately  management believes that the decrease in unit shipments and net revenues is primarily due to continued over capacity in the major electronics markets  particularly in the communications markets

in addition  there was  of increased compensation expense due to certain manufacturing engineering groups being transferred in the third quarter of to operations  where they are included in cost of sales  from research and development  and an increase in depreciation on the second generation automated production line  including equipment for fastrak  of approximately  in the company expects to review the remaining useful lives of certain equipment in connection with the conversion of second generation products to the fastrak platform  and may shorten the useful lives of such equipment  as necessary going forward 
this would result in higher depreciation expense on this equipment in and these items were partially offset by higher provisions for inventory reserves for potential excess raw materials during of approximately  the higher provisions in were considered necessary due to higher levels of inventory at a time when demand for the company s products was declining 
the company continues to refine the designs  processes  equipment and parts associated with second generation products 
unless and until the company achieves higher production volumes for both its first and second generation products and attains higher yield levels and component cost reductions on second generation products  gross margins will continue to be adversely affected

due to a law change in which allowed temporarily for a five year carryback  the carryback period for losses incurred in and beyond is reverting back to two years  from the five years allowed in although any losses incurred in future periods will be available to offset future taxable income  due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding estimating future taxable income  if any  the company does not expect to record a benefit for federal and state income tax purposes in the company will continue to assess its effective tax rate and the need for valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets
