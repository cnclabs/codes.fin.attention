item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales were  for the year ended december   which represented an increase of  or over sales of  for the year ended december  net sales are computed by subtracting from gross sales early pay discounts  returns  seasonal discounts  and allowances  which together totaled  for the composite sales consisted of moistureshield net sales of  and decking choicedek classic  choicedek plus and choicedek premium net sales of  these figures compare with moistureshield net sales of  and choicedek decking net sales of the texas plant net sales increased to  in  from  an increase of  or 
the texas plant primarily produces the choicedek classic product line  but also produced choicedek premium in texas net sales in for choicedek were  compared to  in  a decrease of  net sales of moistureshield were  compared to  in  an increase of  the arkansas plant net sales in were  an increase of million  or  over sales of  decking net sales increased from  in to  in  an increase of million or 
during  moistureshield net sales were  which was an increase of  or from moistureshield net sales of  net sales increased primarily due to weyerhaeuser s new contract to supply all lowe s stores with choicedek premium 
net sales were limited  however  by our production capacity 
during  we added production capacity and expect to add more capacity during as a result  we expect sales to increase versus cost of goods sold increased  from  in to  in however  as a percent of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased in  from in to in the changes in the three major cost components of cost of goods sold as a percent of sales were as follows  raw materials decreased  direct labor increased  and manufacturing overhead increased 
a summary of the cost of goods sold is presented below 
expense category payroll and payroll taxes   depreciation   raw materials   other   total cost of goods sold   amounts for other have been reclassified from the prior year s presentation to compare to the current year presentation for this cost category 
in late  the price of petroleum products increased materially  which drove up the cost of virgin plastic resin 
because of uncertainties created by world political tensions  we believe this trend will continue in as the price of resin increases  plastic consumers increasingly turn to recycled plastics 
the increased demand in turn raises the price that we must pay 
because we use both waste plastics and virgin resin  we expect a higher percentage cost of materials for versus to help offset rising materials costs  and to be assured of a cleaner  more dependable  and consistent supply of plastic raw material  we are in the process of expanding the plastic processing capacity at a second northwest arkansas facility and seeking new sources of waste plastic materials 
we expect this additional plastic processing capacity to come on line in the third quarter of  subject to the availability of operating cash flow  financing from either the proceeds of our industrial development bond financing currently held in escrow  or from other debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that we will have funds available to increase plastic processing capacity see liquidity and capital resources and note bonds payable 
selling and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in  a million increase 
the increase includes a million settlement of outstanding litigation see litigation 
excluding the litigation settlement  selling and administrative costs were million  which we believe more accurately reflects our on going obligations in this category 
as a percent of sales  selling and administrative expenses decreased from to in  an amount of  was charged as research and development 
excluding the litigation settlement  the increase in selling and administrative expenses was principally attributable to additional sales staff and increased marketing and brand building expenses related to the new weyerhaeuser contract with lowe s 
the operating profit for was million  up from an operating profit of million in  an  improvement 
the increased profit was due to higher sales 
net interest increased to  in  up  from  in the texas plant recorded a net profit of  in  an earnings improvement of  from the net loss of  in the texas plant extrusion lines were reduced from to in and other operating improvements were made 
the result was improved efficiency and reduced production costs while still achieving a slight increase in sales 
the springdale  arkansas plant recorded a net profit of  in compared to a net profit of  in this is an increase of  the earnings improvement resulted from efficiencies implemented in operations and the increase in sales volume while holding expenses at a slower growth rate than the sales increase 
net profit for was  this compares to a net profit in of  or an increase in earnings of  or over last year 
we believe that increased production and sales  improved product focus  increased job training  and increased throughputs have allowed us to attain and increase profitability 
additional production capacity and increased efficiency will be required for us to increase sales and profits  of which there is no assurance 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales were  for the year ended december   which represented an increase of  or over sales of  for the year ended december  net sales are computed by subtracting from gross sales early pay discounts  returns  seasonal discounts and allowances  which together totaled  for the composite sales consisted of moistureshield net sales of  and decking choicedek classic  choicedek plus and choicedek premium net sales of  these figures compare with moistureshield net sales of  and choicedek decking net sales of the texas plant net sales increased to  in from  an increase of  or

moistureshield net sales of  represented a decrease of  or from moistureshield net sales of  cost of goods sold increased  from  in to  in however  as a percent of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased in  from in to in all three major cost components of cost of goods sold decreased as a percent of sales  raw materials decreased  direct labor decreased  and manufacturing overhead decreased 
in  the company started the year with a program to reduce its manufacturing costs and it was successful 
the following manufacturing expenses were reduced by a total of  or  as compared to repair and maintenance  tooling  leases rents  supplies  fuel and oil  and waste disposal 
a summary of the cost of goods sold is presented below 
significant cost categories are as follows expense category payroll and payroll taxes   depreciation   raw materials   other   total cost of goods sold   amounts for payroll and payroll taxes and other have been reclassified from the prior year s presentation to compare to the current year presentation for these cost categories 
selling and administrative expenses  excluding litigation expense of  increased  to million in  up from million in including litigation expense  the increase was  to  in from  in as a percent of sales  selling and administrative expenses increased from to excluding the litigation percent increase  the following expenses increased as a percent of sales salaries  commissions  advertising and promotion  and travel and entertainment 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses was directly attributable to increased decking sales 
all of these expenses related to the buildup of the sales staff and developmental and marketing expenses for the build up of the brand awareness of choicedek in conjunction with weyerhaeuser 
the operating profit for was  up from an operating loss of  in  a million improvement and a significant turnaround over prior periods 
the profit was attained by reducing operating costs  even as selling and administrative expenses increased 
net interest increased to  in up  from  in the texas plant recorded a net loss of  in  a decrease of  from the net loss of  in the texas plant experienced significant downtime and efficiency reductions associated with capital improvements  combined with reduced fourth quarter sales of choicedek classic 
the texas plant also carried a significant amount of corporate overhead that may be reduced in future periods as sales continue to increase at other aert locations 
this reflects improvements made in reducing targeted manufacturing overhead expenses by  the springdale  arkansas plant recorded a net profit of  in as compared to a net loss of  in this is a positive change of  the earnings improvement resulted from efficiencies implemented in operations and the increase in sales volume while holding expenses at a slower growth rate than the sales increase  and  as previously mentioned  the programs to reduce manufacturing overhead expenses which resulted in a savings of  in the net profit for  the first profitable year in the history of the company  was  this compares to a net loss in of  or an increase in earnings of  over last year 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had a working capital deficit of  compared to a working capital deficit of  at december  the company expended approximately million on capital expansion during  primarily for improving our equipment at both production facilities in the areas of extrusion  raw material processing and plastic production 
the increase in the working capital deficit is primarily attributable to the company s payout for its legal settlement and its decision to finance its ongoing expansion from cash flow and short term loans 
of such deficit  involving total current liabilities of approximately million as of december   million was for bonds payable  which is currently escrowed and offset by a million restricted bond escrow fund  million was to the company s major shareholder or companies controlled by her  million was in short term bridge loans  million was for miscellaneous accrued liabilities  and approximately million was in payables 
the million working capital deficit reflects management s decision to enter into short term debt financing  while the company has expanded  built and improved its production and sales capacities to increase cash flows from operations 
the company s plan was to issue short term debt and refinance in the future  rather than enter into what it felt would have been more expensive and dilutive equity financing at that time 
the company generated sufficient cash flow to more than cover debt service 
cash flow available for debt service for the year ended december   was approximately million  up from million for the year ended december  the company closed a million tax exempt bond financing during the fourth quarter of  which was intended to refinance existing obligations  shift construction and expansion related accounts payable into long term financing and provide additional financing of capital expenditures 
the bonds were subject to mandatory tender for purchase by the company in whole on october  the reset date  at which time the bonds were repurchased by the bondholder and a new reset date of october  was established 
just prior to that date  the tragedy of september  occurred  and the bond markets were unsettled 
while we were seeking to remarket the bonds  we continued to invest additional short term funds into the company  and used our cash flow to continue to grow and expand our production capabilities 
the bonds are currently due to reset on april  the terms and covenants of the bonds in regard to the company s financing needs are being reexamined and negotiated with potential buyers 
the final reset date for the issuance of the bonds is october  at that time  the bonds will have to be repurchased and retired 
currently  due to the circumstances in the industrial revenue bond market  the slowing economy  low interest rates and the uncertainty concerning iraq and the middle eastern region  it is questionable if the bonds will be rolled over past october   or if alternative financing at more competitive rates can be acquired 
therefore  the bonds could be repurchased with its escrowed funds and retired on october  if the bonds are retired  we will have to take a one time write off of approximately million for costs associated with the initial marketing of the bonds and the rollover attempts to reissue the bonds over the past four years 
because of our increased productive capacity  strong customer commitments and the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service  we are evaluating several financing alternatives for million of non bond resources to continue our expansion and to refinance some of our short term debt 
this financing could allow us to complete the projects that are underway in a more timely manner and commence additional projects 
cash decreased  in significant components of that decrease were i cash provided by operating activities of  which consisted of the net income for the period of  increased by depreciation and amortization of  and increased by other sources of cash of  ii cash used in investing activities of  and iii cash used in financing activities of  payments on notes during the period were  and proceeds from the issuances of notes amounted to  at december   the company had bonds and notes payable in the amount of  of which  was current bonds and notes payable and the current portion of long term debt 
of the current bonds and notes payable   or was to marjorie s
