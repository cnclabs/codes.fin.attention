the company s services range from providing customers with a single consultant to multi personnel full scale projects 
although the company has contracts with many of its customers to provide its services  in general  such contracts are terminable upon relatively short notice  typically not more than days 
there can be no assurance that the company s customers will continue to enter into contracts with the company or that existing contracts will not be terminated

no single fixed price project was material to the company s business during or the company believes that  as it pursues its strategy of providing application management services to customers  it will continue to offer fixed price projects 
the company believes that there are certain risks related to fixed price arrangements and thus prices such arrangements to reflect the associated risk

the company has reported a million loss from discontinued operations for the period from january  to july  application of critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  impairments and estimation of useful lives of long term assets  income tax recognition of current and deferred tax items and accruals for contingencies 
in addition  the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements include further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company generates revenue from professional services rendered to customers 
the majority of the company s revenue is generated under time and material contracts whereby costs are generally incurred in proportion with contracted billing schedules and revenue is recognized as services are performed  with the corresponding cost of providing those services reflected as cost of sales 
the majority of customers are billed on an hourly or daily basis whereby actual time is charged directly to the customer 
such method is expected to result in reasonably consistent profit margins over the contract term 
the company also derives a portion of its revenue from fixed price  fixed time contracts 
revenue generated from most fixed price contracts  including most application management and support contracts  is recognized ratably over the contract term  on a monthly basis in accordance with the terms of the contract 
revenue generated from certain other fixed price contracts is recognized based on the ratio of labor hours incurred to estimated total labor hours 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made  based on historical experience and milestones set in the contract 
the company s project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually review labor hours incurred and estimated total labor hours  which may result in revisions to the amount of recognized revenue for the contract 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed for a contract or if the company does not manage the project properly within the planned time period  then a loss may be recognized on the contract 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through approval and monitoring processes 
risks relating to service delivery  usage  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
unbilled services at december  and represent services provided through december  and  respectively  which are billed subsequent to year end 
all such amounts are anticipated to be realized in the following year 
the company recognizes revenue for services where collection from the client is probable 
the company establishes billing terms at the time project deliverables are agreed 
the company continually monitors timely payments from customers and assesses collection issues 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its clients to make required payments 
the company bases its estimates on historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit policy  detailed analysis of specific client situations and percentage of accounts receivable by aging category 
valuation of long term assets 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
if such circumstances exist  the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
accounting for income taxes 
the company records income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss credit carryforwards 
the company s consolidated financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred since  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
fasb sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the company evaluates the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of historical operating losses and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  the company has recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million against gross deferred tax assets of million 
the decision to record the valuation allowance required significant judgment 
had the company not recorded this allowance  the company would have reported materially different results 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the company s effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
contingent liabilities 
the company has certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company accrues contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
the company is subject to various pending or threatened legal matters which have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
the ultimate outcome of these items is uncertain and the potential loss  if any  may be significantly higher or lower than amounts previously accrued by the company

as of december   million of the liability remains outstanding  of which million is included in other long term liabilities 
at december   the company re evaluated the realizability of the carrying value of the note  as well as any required change to the obligations associated with the office space costs
