item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset management 
while we sell products in various countries throughout the world  and product categories may vary from region to region  over the past two years sales within our consolidated product categories have remained fairly consistent within the following ranges peripherals systems networking software with the acquisition of compaq computer corporation compaq by hp in may  sales of products sourced from the combined hp compaq entity accounted for   and of net sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
hp continues to compete with distributors by selling directly to end users and or resellers in certain product categories  customer segments and or geographies 
our net sales have been adversely affected by this trend  which has been primarily focused on hp s computer systems business in the us market 
hp s printer business through distribution has not been affected 
in addition  microsoft software accounted for of our net sales in fiscal there were no other vendors that accounted for or more of our net sales in   or customers and services we purchase products directly from manufacturers and publishers in large quantities for sale to an active reseller base of more than  vars  direct marketers  retailers  internet resellers and corporate resellers 
while we sell products in various countries throughout the world  and customer channels may vary from region to region  over the past two years sales within our consolidated customer channels have remained fairly consistent within the following ranges vars direct marketers  retailers and internet resellers corporate resellers no single customer accounted for more than of our net sales during fiscal   or the market for vars is attractive because vars generally rely on distributors as their principal source of computer products and financing 
this reliance is due to vars typically lacking the resources to establish a large number of direct purchasing relationships or stock significant product inventories 
direct marketers  retailers and corporate resellers may establish direct relationships with manufacturers and publishers for their more popular products  but utilize distributors as the primary source for other product requirements and the alternative source for products acquired directly 
we have also developed special programs to meet the unique needs of direct marketers  retailers and internet resellers 
in addition to a strong product offering  we provide resellers a high level of service through our pre and post sale technical support  suite of electronic commerce tools including web order entry and edi services  customized shipping documents  product configuration integration services and flexible financing programs 
we also provide services to our vendors by giving them the opportunity to participate in a number of special promotions  training programs and marketing services targeted to the needs of our resellers 
while we believe that services such as these help to set us apart from our competition  they contribute less than to our overall revenues 
we provide our vendors one of the largest bases of resellers throughout the united states  europe  canada  latin america  the caribbean  and the middle east  delivering products to customers from our regionally located logistics centers 
locating logistics centers near our customers enables us to deliver products on a timely basis  thereby reducing the customers need to invest in inventory 
see item properties for further discussion of our locations and logistics centers 
sales and electronic commerce currently  our sales force consists of approximately  field and inside telemarketing sales representatives 
field sales representatives are located in major metropolitan areas 
each field representative is supported by inside telemarketing sales teams covering a designated territory 
our team concept provides a strong personal relationship between representatives of the customers and tech data 
territories with no field representation are serviced exclusively by the inside telemarketing sales teams 
customers typically call their inside sales teams on dedicated toll free numbers or contact us through various electronic methods to place orders 
if the product is in stock and the customer has available credit  customer orders are generally shipped the same day from the logistics facility nearest the customer 
increasingly  customers rely upon our electronic ordering and information systems  in addition to our product catalogs and frequent mailings  as sources for product information  including availability and price 
our on line computer system allows the inside sales teams to check current stocking levels in each of the six united states logistics centers 
likewise  inside sales teams in europe  canada  latin america  the caribbean  and the middle east can check on stocking levels in their respective logistics centers 
through our website  most customers can gain remote access to our information systems to check product availability and pricing and to place orders 
certain of our larger customers have edi services available whereby orders  order acknowledgments  invoices  inventory status reports  customized pricing information and other industry standard edi transactions are consummated on line  which improves efficiency and timeliness for ourselves and our customers 
during fiscal  approximately billion of our worldwide sales dollar volume originated from orders received electronically  up from approximately billion in fiscal we also provide comprehensive training to our field and inside sales representatives regarding technical characteristics of products and our policies and procedures 
in addition  this training program is supplemented by product seminars offered by manufacturers and publishers 
competition we operate in a market characterized by intense competition  based upon such factors as product availability  credit availability  price  delivery and various services and support provided by the distributor to the customer 
we believe that we are well equipped to compete effectively with other distributors in all of these areas 
we compete against several distributors in the north american market  including ingram micro and synnex 
in latin america  we compete against ingram micro and several regional and local distributors 
competition outside of the americas includes ingram micro  actebis and a variety of smaller regional and local distributors 
we also compete with manufacturers and publishers who sell directly to resellers and end users 
nevertheless  we believe that in the majority of cases  manufacturers and publishers choose to sell products through distributors rather than directly because of the relatively small volume and high selling costs associated with numerous small orders 
management also believes that our prompt delivery of products and efficient handling of returns provide an important competitive advantage over manufacturers and publishers efforts to market their products directly 
employees on january   we had approximately  employees located as follows united states  europe  and all other regions certain of our employees in various countries outside the united states are subject to laws providing representation rights to employees on management boards 
we consider relations with our employees to be good 
foreign and domestic operations and export sales we operate predominantly in a single industry segment as a wholesale distributor of computer based technology products and services 
therefore  the principal markets  products and services and methods of distribution from which each segment derives its revenues are essentially the same 
the principal geographical areas in which we operate are the united states  europe including the middle east and other international areas  which include in country operations in canada  brazil  chile  peru  uruguay and export sales to latin america and the caribbean from the united states 
in fiscal   and    and  respectively  of our sales were derived from outside of the united states 
we closed our operations in norway and hungary during the first half of fiscal operating losses incurred during the wind down of these operations totaled less than million  which has been reflected in operating income during fiscal in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold our operations in argentina to local management and liquidated one of our european financing subsidiaries 
with respect to the argentina transaction  we took a charge of approximately million on the sale  in addition to the realization of approximately million in foreign currency exchange losses previously recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in connection with the liquidation of the european financing subsidiary  we repatriated approximately million of capital  which resulted in the realization of approximately million in foreign currency exchange gains previously recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the net effect of these transactions resulted in a total pre tax loss of approximately million  recorded within loss on disposition of subsidiaries during fiscal we continue to evaluate our risk exposure eg  risks surrounding currency rates  regulatory environments  political instability  etc 
around the world and consider actions necessary to reduce our overall risk 
to the extent we decide to close additional operations  we may incur charges and operating losses related to such closures  as well as recognize a portion of our accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a non operating foreign currency exchange gain or loss

net sales the following table represents our net sales by geographic segment year ended january  change change net sales united states europe other international total like many companies in the it industry  we experienced significant challenges in our business environment over the past two years  due primarily to negative macro economic forces  a continued slowdown in the it industry  competitive market conditions  and the direct sales efforts of certain vendors  primarily in the us as a result  consolidated net sales for fiscal declined compared to the prior year  after a reduction in fiscal the majority of the reduction in our sales for both years took place in the us region  where revenue declined by in fiscal  after decreasing by in fiscal sales in the us were mostly impacted by continued pressure on business capital spending  competition in the marketplace  and the decision of certain vendors to pursue a direct sales model 
in us dollar terms  our fiscal international sales remained relatively flat year over year  but did decline by in fiscal the slower decline in us dollar sales of our international operations compared to the us region caused the mix of international sales to grow over the past two years to approximately of total sales compared to in fiscal and in fiscal as a component of our international operations  europe is by far the largest 
in us dollar terms  the european region grew sales by during fiscal  however  on a local currency basis  sales in the region fell by 
exchange rates had the opposite effect in the prior year  where the decrease in european fiscal sales was on a us dollar basis  but only fell in terms of local currency 
decreases seen in local currency sales in europe for both years were due to both softness in the european it market and competition in the marketplace 
other international sales  which comprised only of our consolidated revenue for fiscal  experienced a reduction in fiscal  after a decrease of in fiscal other international sales in dropped due to economic pressures  along with intense competition in the canadian region  while sales in latin america fell more dramatically due to significant economic instability in those countries  along with management s decision to scale back our operations in brazil and argentina 
sales in fiscal were affected mostly by lower overall demand and weaker currencies in canada and latin america 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin dropped twelve basis points in fiscal compared to the prior year  after rising by three basis points during fiscal as compared to fiscal 
the vast majority of the decrease in gross margin during fiscal was due to our european operations  which saw generally greater competitive margin pressures in an attempt to maintain market share 
the three basis point increase in gross margin during fiscal was due to the positive effects of our margin improvement programs and an increase in the mix of international sales which tend to have higher gross margins 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal we continued to focus on stringent expense controls  reducing selling  general and administrative expenses sg a by  or million from the prior year 
even as a percent of sales  sg a decreased by five basis points from fiscal  exhibiting the scalability of our business model 
in order to achieve these expense reductions  among other actions  we maintained our focus on budgetary controls over all discretionary expenses  such as travel related costs  consulting  and supplies 
we also reduced our payroll and related costs  managing our number of employees down 
included in the million in cost reductions above are million related to the elimination of goodwill amortization  as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas or statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
however  this reduction was offset almost entirely by the approximate million that we expensed on harmonizing and upgrading our european information systems infrastructure during fiscal during fiscal we began the process of adjusting costs to meet the lower demand for it products and services  reducing sg a by or million from the prior year 
in order to counter the economic downturn  we significantly reduced our payroll and related costs  managing our number of employees down 
likewise  we dramatically cut back on discretionary expenses such as travel related costs  consulting and supplies 
while these cost cutting measures were significant  they could not entirely offset the effect of the year over year sales decline and as a result sg a  as a percentage of net sales  increased basis points to from in the prior year 
the greater mix of international sales in fiscal also contributed to the higher sg a as a percentage of net sales  as the international model typically results in greater costs along with a higher gross margin as previously discussed 
in addition to those items mentioned above  sg a was negatively affected by losses in latin america during the fourth quarter  these operating losses were primarily related to currency devaluation and asset realization issues in argentina and brazil 
special charges in addition to those items mentioned above  operating income was negatively affected in fiscal by a million impairment to goodwill resulting from the application of sfas no 
sfas no 
revised the standards of accounting for goodwill by replacing the amortization of these assets with the requirement that they be reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
at the end of fiscal  we performed our annual test of goodwill to determine if there was impairment 
this testing included the determination of each reporting unit s fair value using market multiples and discounted cash flows modeling 
our reduced earnings and cash flow forecast  primarily due to the prolonged downturn in the economy  uncertain demand  and competitive industry conditions  resulted in the determination that a goodwill impairment charge was necessary 
the million non cash charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal special charges of million were recognized in fiscal these special charges related to the recording of a the write off of previously capitalized software costs million  b the impairment of certain internet related investments million and  c the write off of development costs associated with a new german logistics center million  the construction of which has been indefinitely deferred 
the remaining internet related investment had a carrying value of approximately million at january  and investments in these types of technologies are inherently risky and we could lose the remainder of our investment 
loss on disposition of subsidiaries due to currency related issues  political instability and continued economic concerns in the country  we decided to sell our operations in argentina to local management in fiscal in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we liquidated one of our european financing subsidiaries 
with respect to the argentina transaction  we took a charge of approximately million on the sale  in addition to the realization of approximately million in foreign currency exchange losses previously recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in connection with the liquidation of the european financing subsidiary  we repatriated approximately million of capital  which resulted in the realization of approximately million in foreign currency exchange gains previously recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the net effect of these transactions resulted in a total pre tax loss of approximately million  recorded within loss on disposition of subsidiaries during fiscal there were no significant dispositions of subsidiaries during fiscal interest expense  interest income  and foreign currency exchange gains losses interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was the result of a significant reduction in our average outstanding indebtedness and a decline in our interest rates 
the decrease in fiscal was slightly offset as a result of a million premium payment related to the redemption of our million convertible subordinated debentures on december  the debentures  scheduled to mature on july   were redeemed at a price of or million 
this redemption allowed us to take advantage of low interest rates and save approximately million through the original maturity date 
interest income remained relatively flat at million  increasing less than over fiscal we realized a net foreign currency exchange gain of million in fiscal compared to a gain of million in fiscal the fluctuation from prior year was attributable primarily to our operations in europe  and to a lesser extent  our operations in latin america 
the european gain can be attributed to the strengthening of the euro  as many of our payables are denominated in us dollars and are not fully hedged  and the currency devaluation in argentina  where we were in a net us dollar monetary asset position during fiscal it continues to be our goal to minimize foreign currency exchange gains and losses through effective hedging techniques 
our foreign exchange policy prohibits entering into speculative transactions 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was the result of a significant decrease in our average outstanding indebtedness and a decrease in rates 
we were able to reduce our outstanding debt  net of cash  by over million during fiscal due to dramatic improvements in our inventory management and the cash generated from other operating activities 
interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in cash available for investment throughout the year 
we realized a net foreign currency exchange gain of million in fiscal compared to a gain of million in fiscal provision for income taxes our effective tax rate changed to in fiscal from in fiscal the change in effective tax rate is primarily due to non deductible special charges incurred during fiscal due to an increase in our taxable income  the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is attributable to the decrease in taxable income during the year combined with a decrease in our effective tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in our effective rate was primarily due to fluctuations and changes in the mix of taxable income within our various geographies and tax jurisdictions reported in each period 
net income and earnings per share as a result of the factors described above  net income in fiscal decreased to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in fiscal excluding special charges and the loss on disposition of subsidiaries  net income increased to million  or per diluted share in fiscal compared to per diluted share in fiscal for fiscal  net income decreased to million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share in fiscal excluding special charges  net income decreased to million  or per diluted share in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory  vendor incentives  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes and contingencies 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in estimating the required allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio  the existence of credit insurance and specifically identified customer risks 
if actual customer performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected by us  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of its cost or market value 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks  foreign currency fluctuations for foreign sourced product  and assumptions about future demand 
market conditions that are less favorable than those projected by management may require additional inventory write downs that could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
vendor incentives we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other incentive agreements 
these incentives are generally under quarterly  semi annual or annual agreements with the vendors  however  some of these incentives are negotiated on an ad hoc basis to support specific programs mutually developed between ourselves and the vendor 
vendors generally require that we use their cooperative advertising allowances exclusively for advertising or other marketing programs 
these restricted cooperative advertising allowances are recognized as a reduction of sg a as the related marketing expenses are recognized  however  we are evaluating the impact of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  which  during fiscal will require reclassification of a portion of certain funds received from vendors from sg a to gross profit  but will have no effect on net income 
for further details  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we record unrestricted volume rebates received as a reduction of inventory and recognize the incentives as a reduction of cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold 
amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are deferred in the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we receive early payment discounts from certain vendors 
we record early payment discounts received as a reduction of inventory and recognize the discount as a reduction of cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold 
goodwill and intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment 
goodwill may also be reviewed more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
as required by sfas no 
 we performed an annual test of goodwill to determine if there was impairment 
this testing included the determination of each reporting unit s fair value using market multiples and discounted cash flows modeling 
our reduced earnings and cash flow forecast  primarily due to the prolonged downturn in the economy  uncertain demand  and competitive industry conditions  resulted in the determination that a goodwill impairment charge was necessary 
the million non cash charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal for further details on this impairment  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we examine the carrying value of our intangible assets with finite lives  which includes capitalized software and development costs and customer lists  as current events and circumstances warrant to determine whether there are any impairment losses 
if indicators of impairment are present in intangible assets used in operations and future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
during fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million for the write off of previously capitalized software costs 
deferred taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of recorded valuation allowances  we consider a variety of factors including  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine we would be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would reduce income tax expense  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we are unable to use all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income tax expense  thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies we accrue for contingent obligations  including estimated legal costs  when it is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include tax  legal  and other regulatory matters such as imports and exports  which are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
revises the standards of accounting for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets by replacing the regular amortization of these assets with the requirement that they are reviewed annually for possible impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
separable intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we adopted sfas no 
effective february   and during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended january   we finalized the required transitional impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
based on the results of the transitional impairment tests  no adjustments for impairment were necessary 
subsequently  at the end of fiscal  we performed our annual impairment testing and determined the fair value of each reporting unit using market multiples and discounted cash flows modeling 
our reduced earnings and cash flow forecast  primarily due to the prolonged downturn in the economy  uncertain demand  and competitive industry conditions  resulted in the determination that a goodwill impairment charge was necessary 
the million non cash charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  among other provisions  this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate any inconsistency between the reporting requirements for sale leaseback transactions and certain lease modifications that have similar economic effects 
additionally  this statement rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  as well as sfas no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements  as debt extinguishments are no longer classified as extraordinary items unless they meet the requirement in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions of being unusual and infrequently occurring 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  as liabilities for these costs are now recognized when incurred rather than at the date an entity commits to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
were effective  on a prospective basis  for exit or disposal activities initiated by us after december   and did not have a material impact upon our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires that a liability be recorded on the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin no 
requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a rollforward of the entity s product warranty liabilities 
we applied the recognition provisions of fin no 
prospectively to guarantees issued after december   which did not result in a material impact upon our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the disclosure provisions of fin no 
were effective for financial statements issued after december  and are therefore included in the financial statements presented herein 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
requires prominent annual and interim disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ended after december   and therefore  are included in the financial statements presented herein 
while sfas no 
allows for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  we continue to use the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations for those plans  therefore  we do not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact upon our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin no 
provides guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  such entities are known as variable interest entities vies 
fin no 
applies to new entities that are created after the effective date  as well as to existing entities 
for vies created before february   the recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 
are effective for us no later than the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal  while for vies created after january   the recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 
are effective immediately 
we are in the process of assessing what impact  if any  fin no 
may have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in january  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance regarding how a reseller of a vendor s products should account for cash consideration received from that vendor 
we expect that contracts subject to this guidance will result in the reclassification of a portion of certain vendor funds from sg a to gross profit  but will have no effect on net income 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
apply to vendor arrangements entered into after december   including modifications of existing arrangements 
as no material modifications or new arrangements were entered into during january  adoption of the provisions of eitf issue no 
for new or modified arrangements after december  did not have a material impact upon our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation  as technological advances and competition within the microcomputer industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline 
management believes that most price increases could be passed on to our customers  as prices charged by us are not set by long term contracts  however  as a result of competitive pressure  there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our customers 
quarterly data seasonality our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future as a result of seasonal variations in the demand for the products and services offered by us 
our narrow operating margins may magnify the impact of these factors on our operating results 
specific historical seasonal variations in our operating results have included a reduction of demand in europe during the summer months  increased canadian government purchasing in the first quarter  and worldwide pre holiday stocking in the retail channel during the september to november period 
in addition  the product cycle of major products may materially impact our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our quarterly results 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal was primarily attributable to decreases in inventories and accounts receivable 
we continue to focus on maintaining strong asset turnover  as evidenced by maintaining our relatively low days of inventory supply of days at the end of fiscal  and days at the end of fiscal net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal was primarily attributable to the expansion or upgrade of our management information systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers  which included million in costs related to harmonizing and upgrading our european systems infrastructure 
depending upon economic conditions  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal to further expand or upgrade our it systems  logistics centers and office facilities  which includes million to continue upgrading our european systems infrastructure 
we continue to make significant investments to implement new it systems and upgrade our existing it infrastructure in order to meet our changing business requirements 
these implementations and upgrades occur at various levels throughout the company and include  but are not limited to  new operating and enterprise systems  financial systems  web technologies  customer relationship management systems and telecommunications 
while we believe we will realize increased operating efficiencies as a result of these investments  unforeseen circumstances or complexities could have an adverse impact on our business 
net cash used in financing activities of million during fiscal reflects the proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan  borrowings on our revolving credit loans of million  net of the redemption of the million convertible debentures 
as of january   we maintain a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires in may we intend to renew this credit facility for another three year period 
we pay interest average rate of at january  under this revolving credit facility at the applicable eurocurrency rate plus a margin based on our credit ratings 
additionally  we currently maintain a million receivables securitization program with a syndicate of banks expiring in may  which we intend to reduce to million and renew for another year 
we pay interest average rate of at january  on the receivables securitization program at designated commercial paper rates plus an agreed upon margin 
in addition to these credit facilities  we maintain additional lines of credit and overdraft facilities totaling approximately million 
the aforementioned credit facilities total approximately billion  of which million was outstanding at january  these credit facilities contain covenants that must be complied with on a continuous basis  including the maintenance of certain financial ratios  restrictions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the amount of common stock that may be repurchased annually 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of january  the ability to draw funds under these credit facilities is dependent upon sufficient collateral in the case of the receivables securitization program and meeting the aforementioned financial covenants  which limits our ability to draw the full amount of these facilities 
as of january   the maximum amount that could be borrowed under these facilities  in consideration of the availability of collateral and the financial covenants  was approximately million 
for a more detailed discussion of our credit facilities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  we issued million of convertible subordinated debentures due the debentures bear interest at per year and are convertible into our common stock at any time  if the market price of the common stock exceeds a specified percentage  beginning at and declining each year until it reaches at maturity  of the conversion price per share of common stock  or in other specified instances 
holders may convert debentures into shares per  principal amount of debentures  equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
the debentures are convertible into  shares of our common stock 
holders have the option to require us to repurchase the debentures on any of the fourth  eighth  twelfth or sixteenth anniversary dates from the issue date at of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the repurchase date 
we have the option to satisfy any debentures submitted for repurchase in either cash and or our common stock  provided that shares of common stock at the first purchase date will be valued at of fair market value as defined in the indenture and at of fair market value for all subsequent purchase dates 
the debentures are redeemable in whole or in part for cash  at our option at any time on or after december  we will pay contingent interest on the debentures during specified six month periods beginning on december   if the market price of the debentures exceeds specified levels 
in addition  the dilutive impact of the million of convertible subordinated debentures  due  is excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculations due to the conditions for the contingent conversion feature not being met 
in august  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec for million of debt and equity securities 
the net proceeds from any issuance are expected to be used for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  the repayment or refinancing of debt and to meet working capital needs 
as of january   we had not issued any debt or equity securities under this registration statement  nor can any assurances be given that we will issue any debt or equity securities under this registration statement in the future 
on july   we issued million of convertible subordinated debentures due july   which were redeemed in december at a price of  or million  plus interest accrued to the redemption date 
unamortized deferred debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the debentures were not significant 
we believe that cash from operations  available and obtainable bank credit lines  and trade credit from our vendors will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through fiscal principal maturities of long term debt and amounts due under future minimum lease payments are as follows operating leases capital leases long term debt total in thousands fiscal year thereafter total payments less amounts representing interest total principal payments we lease certain logistics centers and office facilities under a five year synthetic lease facility provided by a group of financial institutions  which expires in may the sum of future minimum lease payments under this lease facility at january  was approximately million  which is included in the schedule above 
in accordance with the terms of the synthetic lease facility and the internal revenue code  we claim tax deductions for interest and depreciation on the leased assets 
the maximum funding of our leasing activities available under the synthetic lease facility is million of which we had utilized million at january  
the synthetic lease facility has an initial term of five years  with rent obligations commencing on the date construction of a discrete project is complete 
at any time during the term of the lease  we may  at our option  purchase the property at approximately the amount expended by the lessor to purchase the land and construct the building purchase value 
if we elect not to purchase the property at the end of the lease  we have guaranteed a percentage of the purchase value 
this guaranty approximated million at january  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure 
we have also entered into other agreements to lease certain office space  logistics centers and equipment for varying periods 
we expect that in the normal course of business  these leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases 
asset management we manage our inventories by maintaining sufficient quantities to achieve high order fill rates while attempting to stock only those products in high demand with a rapid turnover rate 
inventory balances fluctuate as we add new product lines and when appropriate  we make large purchases  including cash purchases from manufacturers and publishers when the terms of such purchases are considered advantageous 
our contracts with most of our vendors provide price protection and stock rotation privileges to reduce the risk of loss due to manufacturer price reductions and slow moving or obsolete inventory 
in the event of a vendor price reduction  we generally receive a credit for the impact on products in inventory  subject to certain limitations 
in addition  we have the right to rotate a certain percentage of purchases  subject to certain limitations 
historically  price protection and stock rotation privileges as well as our inventory management procedures have helped to reduce the risk of loss of inventory value 
we attempt to control losses on credit sales by closely monitoring customers creditworthiness through our it systems  which contain detailed information on each customer s payment history and other relevant information 
we have obtained credit insurance that insures a percentage of the credit extended by us to certain customers against possible loss 
customers who qualify for credit terms are typically granted net day payment terms 
we also sell products on a prepay  credit card  cash on delivery and floor plan basis 
deferred tax assets deferred tax assets have been recorded for net operating loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences 
our deferred tax assets relate to subsidiary operations located in different countries with separate taxing jurisdictions 
although aggregate foreign operations generate pre tax income  certain subsidiaries have a history of net operating losses 
the net change in the deferred income tax valuation allowance was an increase of million at january  the valuation allowance primarily relates to foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million 
the majority of the net operating losses has an indefinite carryforward period with the remaining portion expiring in years through we evaluate a variety of factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
business outlook as we look ahead to fiscal  the demand for it products continues to be uncertain 
this  coupled with competitive margin pressure  causes us to anticipate a year that will largely be driven by the pace of recovery in our industry and the economy 
although we expect to see some improvement in many sg a expenses  total sg a expenses are expected to increase as we anticipate approximately million million will be expensed on our investment in the harmonization and upgrade of our european information systems infrastructure 
due to the factors discussed above  net income excluding the impact of special charges  loss on disposition of subsidiaries and excluding any expected accretive effect from the acquisition of azlan could decline by as much as in fiscal  compared to fiscal effective march   we completed our acquisition of azlan  a uk based european distributor of networking and communications products and provider of training and other value added services 
shareholders of azlan received pence per ordinary share  resulting in total cash consideration of approximately million pounds sterling approximately million  which we funded from our existing credit facilities 
in their most recently reported six month fiscal period  which ended september   azlan generated sales of million pounds sterling 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk as a large international organization  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on our financial results in the future 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies using a variety of financial instruments 
it is our policy to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting cannot be effectively employed and not to enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our primary exposure relates to transactions in which the currency collected from customers is different from the currency used to purchase the product sold in europe  canada and latin america 
in addition  we have foreign currency risk related to debt that is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect our earnings and cash flows from the adverse impact of exchange rate changes 
foreign exchange risk is managed by using foreign currency forward  option and swap contracts to hedge intercompany loans  trade receivables and payables 
we have elected not to designate our foreign currency contracts as hedging instruments  and they are therefore marked to market with changes in their value recorded in the income statement each period 
the underlying exposures are denominated primarily in the following currencies us dollar  canadian dollar  danish krone  euros  swedish krona  swiss franc  british pound  polish zloty and chilean peso

interest rate risk is also present in the forward foreign currency contracts hedging intercompany and third party loans 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objective  we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of january  and january   approximately and  respectively  of the outstanding debt had fixed interest rates through the terms of such debt or through interest rate swap agreements
