critical accounting policies the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting policies which are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and which require some of management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions which could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimate with respect to such matters 
accordingly  future reported financial conditions and results could differ materially from financial conditions and results reported based on management s current estimates 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for leases sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that revenue be recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the use benefit is derived from the leased property 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria are not met  the gain is deferred and the finance  installment or cost recovery method  as appropriate  is applied until the sales criteria are met 
accounts receivable 
the company continuously monitors collections from its tenants and would make a provision for estimated losses based upon historical experience and any specific tenant collection issues that the company has identified 
real estate 
the company evaluates the carrying value of all real estate held to determine if an impairment has occurred which would require the recognition of a loss 
the evaluation includes reviewing anticipated cash flows of the property  based on current leases in place  coupled with an estimate of proceeds to be realized upon sale 
however  estimating future sale proceeds is highly subjective and such estimates could differ materially from actual results 
liquidity and capital resources since becoming a public company  the company s principal source of capital for growth has been the public and private equity markets  selective secured indebtedness  its unsecured credit facility  issuance of op units and undistributed funds from operations 
the company s current million variable rate unsecured revolving credit facility  which is scheduled to expire in march  has made available funds to finance acquisitions and meet any short term working capital requirements 
as of december   million was outstanding at an interest rate of 
the company pays an unused facility fee equal to basis points if or less of the facility is utilized and basis points if greater than of the facility is utilized 
since its formation in  the company has raised  through the issuance of common shares  preferred shares and op units  aggregate capital of approximately million for the purposes of making acquisitions and retiring indebtedness 
in addition  the company has purchased million in real estate through the direct issuance of its common shares and op units 
during  the company completed a million common share offering at per share raising million of net proceeds 
the proceeds were used to repay debt and fund acquisitions 
dividends 
in connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company expects to continue paying regular dividends to its shareholders 
these dividends are expected to be paid from operating cash flows and or from other sources 
since cash used to pay dividends reduces amounts available for capital investments  the company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend payout ratio as a percentage of ffo  reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the maintenance or expansion of properties in its portfolio  debt reduction  the acquisition of interests in new properties as suitable opportunities arise  and such other factors as the board of trustees considers appropriate 
dividends paid to common shareholders increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the company s dividend and distribution ffo payout ratio  on a per share basis  for   and was  and respectively 
although the company receives the majority of its rental payments on a monthly basis  it intends to continue paying dividends quarterly 
the company s two largest tenants  as a percentage of revenue  pay their rent semi annually kmart corporation and quarterly northwest pipeline corp amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution are invested by the company in short term money market or other suitable instruments 
kmart  the company s largest tenant based upon rental revenues  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on january  kmart leases a million square foot distribution facility in warren  ohio 
the company acquired the property in by assuming a non recourse mortgage of million  issuing operating partnership units valued at million and paying million in cash 
the company has no retail properties leased to kmart 
the kmart lease expires on september  annual net rents are presently million 
rents are paid semi annually in arrears 
the property is encumbered by a non recourse first mortgage  bearing imputed interest at per annum with an outstanding balance of million at december  annual debt service on this non recourse mortgage  which fully amortizes by maturity on october   is million 
accordingly  this property currently provides after debt service cash flow to the company of million 
the property is a warehouse distribution facility utilized in kmart s logistical operation 
as of december  the company had million in accounts receivable from kmart including million in straight line rents and million in pre petition rent 
kmart is current in its rental obligation to the company since filing for bankruptcy and the next rental payment is due april  the company believes that cash flows from operations will continue to provide adequate capital to fund its operating and administrative expenses  regular debt service obligations and all dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements in both the short term and long term 
in addition  the company anticipates that cash on hand  borrowings under its unsecured credit facility  issuance of equity and debt  as well as other alternatives  will provide the necessary capital required by the company 
cash flows from operations as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows increased to million for from million for and million for net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash used in investing activities related primarily to investments in real estate properties and joint ventures

in connection with the acquisition of the net partnerships  the company acquired million of cash in net cash provided by used in financing activities totaled million in  million in and million in cash provided by used in financing activities during each year was primarily attributable to proceeds from equity offerings  non recourse mortgages and advances repayments under the company s credit facility coupled with dividend and distribution payments  debt service payments and the repurchase of the company s common shares operating partnership units 
upreit structure 
the company s upreit structure permits the company to effect acquisitions by issuing to a seller of real estate  as a form of consideration  interests in partnerships controlled by the company 
all of such interests are redeemable at certain times for common shares on a one for one basis and all of such interests require the company to pay certain distributions to the holders of such interests 
the company accounts for these interests in a manner similar to a minority interest holder 
the number of common shares that will be outstanding in the future should be expected to increase  and minority interest expense should be expected to decrease as such partnership interests are redeemed for common shares 
the following table provides certain information with respect to such partnership interests as of december  assuming the company s annual dividend rate remains at the current per share 
total current current total annualized annualized redeemable for number affiliate per unit distribution common shares of units units distribution at any time    at any time    at any time   january  december  march  march  november   march  january  february   may  november   affiliate units  which are included in total units  represent op units held by two executive officers including their affiliates of the company

the ability of the company to accomplish such goals will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the real estate industry  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt at the time  the company s equity in the mortgaged properties  the financial condition of the company  the operating history of the mortgaged properties  the then current tax laws and the general national  regional and local economic conditions 
lease obligations 
since the company s tenants bear all or substantially all of the cost of property operations  maintenance and repairs  the company does not anticipate significant needs for cash for these costs 
for five of the properties  the company has a level of property operating expense responsibility and a sixth obligates the company to pay real estate taxes in and for the tenant to be responsible thereafter 
the company generally funds property expansions with additional secured borrowings  the repayment of which is funded out of rental increases under the leases covering the expanded properties 
to the extent there is a vacancy in a property  the company would be obligated for all operating expenses  including real estate taxes and insurance 
the company s tenants pay the rental obligations on ground leases either directly to the fee holder or to the company as increased rent

as of december   the company had repurchased approximately million common shares and operating partnership units  at an average price of approximately per common share unit 
no common shares or units were repurchased in results of operations increase decrease selected income statement data total revenues      total expenses      interest     depreciation and amortization of real estate     general administrative    property operating    gains on sale     extraordinary items    net income      comparison of to changes in the results of operations for the company are primarily due to the growth of its portfolio and costs associated with such growth 
of the increase in total revenues in of million  million is primarily attributable to rental revenue from properties purchased in primarily the purchase of properties from net lp and net lp in november and owned in million and properties purchased in million offset by a reduction in rental revenue from a decrease in overall portfolio occupancy from to million and property sales million 
of the remaining million in revenue growth in  million was attributable to an increase in earnings from non consolidated entities and million was attributable primarily to higher interest earned due to greater cash balances carried 
the million increase in interest expense due to the growth of the company s portfolio has been partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average interest rate from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  due to debt refinancings  scheduled principal amortization payments  lower variable interest rates and lower interest rates on new debt incurred by the company 
the company s general and administrative expenses  which increased in absolute dollars due to the acquisition of properties from net lp and net lp  decreased to of revenue in compared with in property operating expenses increased due to the vacancy of one property in the third quarter of  which resulted in the company incurring property level operating expenses which normally are the responsibility of the tenant  two properties in which the company has a level of operating expense responsibility and an estimate of expenses for the kmart property 
net income increased in due to the impact of items discussed above plus million in gains on sale of properties and a net reduction of million in extraordinary charges related to the retirement of debt 
the company s non consolidated entities had aggregate net income of million in compared with million in the increase in net income is primarily attributable to an increase in rental revenue of million in attributable to the acquisition of properties  the expansion of an existing property and the joint venturing of a single property in advisory fee income increased by million in due to the timing of transactions which generate acquisition fees 
these revenue sources were partly offset by an increase in i interest expense of million in due to partially funding third quarter and fourth quarter acquisitions with the use of non recourse mortgage debt and the joint venturing of a single property in  and ii depreciation expense of million in due to more depreciable assets owned 
the increase in net income in future periods will be closely tied to the level of acquisitions made by the company 
without acquisitions  which in addition to generating rental revenue  generate acquisition  debt placement and asset management fees when such properties are acquired by joint venture or advisory programs  growth in net income is dependent on index adjusted rents leases  percentage rents leases  reduced interest expense on amortizing mortgages and by controlling variable overhead costs 
however  there are many factors beyond management s control that could offset these items including  without limitation  increased interest rates of variable debt million as of december  at a weighted average interest rate of and tenant monetary defaults 
effective january  the company converted its non voting interest in lra to a voting interest and accordingly lra will be consolidated for financial reporting purposes instead of being treated under the equity method as it currently is 
had lra been consolidated historically  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue would have been   and for the years ended december   and  respectively

the increase in interest expense due to the growth of the company s portfolio has been partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average interest rate from at december  to at december  due to debt refinancings  repayments  lower variable interest rates and lower interest rates on new debt incurred by the company 
the company s general and administrative expenses have remained constant in in absolute dollars and decreased to of revenue in compared to of revenue in due to the growth of the company s portfolio relative to these expenses 
the increase in property operating expenses in relates to costs incurred relating to two properties that became vacant in  which resulted in the company incurring property level operating expenses which normally are the responsibility of the tenant  and a third property in which the company has a level of expense responsibility 
net income decreased in due to the impact of items discussed above offset by the incurring of a million extraordinary charge for early extinguishment of debt and a million reduction in gains on sales of properties

funds from operations the company believes that funds from operations ffo enhances an investor s understanding of the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company believes that ffo is an appropriate  but limited  measure of the performance of an equity reit  and that it can be one measure of a reit s ability to make cash distributions 
ffo is defined in the october white paper  issued by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit as net income or loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company included in the calculation of ffo the dilutive effect of the deemed conversion of its outstanding exchangeable notes  which were fully satisfied in ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap  or as a measure of liquidity to other consolidated income or cash flow statement data as determined in accordance with gaap 
the following table reflects the calculation of the company s ffo and cash flow activities for each of the years in the three year period ended december net income    depreciation and amortization of real estate    minority interests share of net income    gain on sale of properties   amortization of leasing commissions deemed conversion of notes payable   joint venture adjustment depreciation    extraordinary item  funds from operations    cash flows from operating activities    cash flows used in investing activities    cash flows from used in financing activities    the company s dividend and distribution ffo payout ratio  on a per share basis  was  and for the years ended december   and respectively 
recently issued accounting standards the company s adoption of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  had no impact of the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
which rescinds sfas no 
which required all gains and losses on extinguishment of debt to be classified as an extraordinary item 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  had the statement been adopted earlier  the extraordinary items recorded in and would have been eliminated and the charges would have been reflected in interest expense 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no

in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires that companies that absorb the majority of another entity s expected losses  receive a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are ownership  contractual  or other economic interests in an entity  consolidate the variable interest entity 
the consolidation requirements apply to all variable interest entities created after january  and all other existing entities beginning july  the company has not determined the impact the adoption of fin will have on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
however  it is possible that the adoption of fin will require the company to consolidate its florence joint venture 
financial information for this joint venture is included in footnote of the company s financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company believes that the adoption of this interpretation will not have a material effect to the company s financial statements
