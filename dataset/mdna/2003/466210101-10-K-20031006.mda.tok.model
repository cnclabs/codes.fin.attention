item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we reported net income of million  or 
per share on a diluted basis  for fiscal  compared to income before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  of million  or 
per share on a diluted basis  for fiscal  and million  or 
per share on a diluted basis  for fiscal as discussed below and more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report  earnings for  and included charges of million million net of tax  million million net of tax and million million net of tax  respectively  related to repositioning our operations to more appropriately align our costs with our business activity 
in addition  earnings for fiscal included favorable currency adjustments of million million net of tax compared to favorable currency adjustments of million million net of tax for fiscal and unfavorable currency adjustments of million million net of tax for fiscal in the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that follows  we attempt to list contributing factors in order of significance to the point being addressed 
results of operations for the year ended july   our revenues were million  down from the million reported for fiscal our revenues for the year ended july  were million  down from the reported for fiscal the following tables outline our revenues by segment  product  and geography in thousands for the years july years ended july  segment machinery    equipment services    access financial solutions a    products aerial work platforms    telehandlers    excavators    after sales service and support  including parts sales  and used and reconditioned equipment sales    financial products a    rentals    geographic united states    europe    other    a revenues for access financial solutions and for financial products are not the same because access financial solutions also receives revenues from rental purchase agreements that are recorded for accounting purposes as rental revenues from operating leases 
the decrease in machinery segment sales from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was primarily attributable to reduced sales of aerial work platforms principally due to the economic pressures in north america and economic pressures and tightened credit conditions in europe partially offset by increased sales in australia 
in addition  sales of our excavator product line declined due to softness in the united states construction market and reduced state and municipal budgets 
the decrease in sales of aerial work platforms and excavators was partially offset by increased telehandler sales from new product introductions  principally from the new north america all wheel steer machines and our european designed product offerings 
fiscal machinery segment revenues also benefited from the reversal of previously accrued volume related customer incentives that were not achieved during the year 
the increase in equipment services segment revenues from for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was principally attributable to increased parts sales and sales of used equipment partially offset by decreased sales of rental fleet equipment 
the increase in access financial solutions segment revenues from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was principally attributable to income received on a larger portfolio of pledged finance receivables from accumulated monetization transactions 
while we have increased interest income attributable to our pledged finance receivables  a corresponding increase in our limited recourse debt results in million of interest income being passed on to monetization purchasers in the form of interest expense on limited recourse debt 
in accordance with the required accounting treatment  payments to monetization purchasers are reflected as interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the decrease in machinery segment sales from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was primarily attributable to lower aerial work platform sales resulting from lower market demand due principally to a weakened north american economy and related factors  a slowing of consolidation in the north american rental industry and coincident efforts of large national rental companies to rationalize their equipment fleets  and tightened credit conditions for equipment purchases in europe 
the increase in equipment services segment revenues from for fiscal to million for fiscal  or  was principally attributable to increased revenues from the conversion of rental purchase agreements  sales of aerial work platform replacement parts and sales of remanufactured  reconditioned and refurbished equipment partially offset by the absence in fiscal of the million sale leaseback of rental fleet assets that occurred during fiscal the increase in access financial solutions segment revenues from million to million was principally attributable to increased financing activities resulting from our larger investment in this new business activity 
our domestic revenues for fiscal were million  down from fiscal revenues of million 
the decrease in our domestic revenues was principally attributable to lower sales of aerial work platforms primarily due to economic pressures in north america and our excavator product line due to the softness in the united states construction market and reduced state and municipal budgets 
this decrease was partially offset by higher sales of telehandlers and service parts as well as increased revenues from financial products 
revenues generated from sales outside the united states during fiscal were million  down from fiscal the decrease in our revenues generated from sales outside the united states was primarily attributable to lower aerial work platform sales in europe due to economic pressures and customer credit constraints  partially offset by increased sales of aerial work platform sales in australia and increased telehandler sales in europe 
our domestic revenues for fiscal were million  down from fiscal revenues of million 
the decrease in our domestic revenues was primarily attributable to lower aerial work platform sales in the weakened domestic economy and the million sale leaseback of rental fleet assets that occurred during the second and third quarters of fiscal revenues generated from sales outside the united states during fiscal were million  down from fiscal the decrease in our revenues generated from sales outside the united states was primarily attributable to lower aerial work platform sales primarily as a result of a softer european economy  a tight credit environment for many of our european customers which reduced demand for our products  and million in deferred manufacturing profit recognized in the first quarter of fiscal related to the sale of our interest in a brazilian joint venture 
our gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was attributable to higher margins in all of our segments 
the gross profit margin of our machinery segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the gross profit margin of our machinery segment increased in fiscal principally due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro  british pound and australian dollar  as well as fewer trade in packages resulting in lower trade in premiums and a more profitable product mix mainly a result of new product introductions 
these increases were offset in part by higher product costs associated with the start up of our maasmechelen facility  the transfer of the telehandler product line to our mcconnellsburg  pennsylvania facility  the negative effect on fixed overhead leveraging due to lower sales volume compared to fiscal and higher warranty costs associated with extended warranty periods 
the gross profit margin of our equipment services segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the gross profit margin of our equipment services segment increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in higher margin service parts sales as a percentage of total segment revenues 
this increase was partially offset by unfavorable mix impact associated with higher used equipment sales and the deferred profit recognized during fiscal from a one time rental fleet sale leaseback transaction 
the gross profit margin of our access financial solutions segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the gross profit margin of our access financial solutions segment increased in fiscal primarily due to increased financial product revenues 
because the costs associated with these revenues are principally selling and administrative expenses and interest expense  gross margins are typically higher in this segment 
our gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline was attributable to lower margins in our machinery and equipment services segments offset in part by higher margins in our access financial solutions segment 
the gross profit margin of our machinery segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the gross profit margin of our machinery segment declined in fiscal principally due to volume related production costs resulting from shutdowns in the second quarter of the current fiscal year 
in order to accelerate reduction of finished goods inventories in response to lower demand for our products  during the second quarter we shut down all manufacturing facilities for nearly half of the available production days resulting in higher average production costs 
the effect of the shutdowns flowed through the income statement as the inventory produced during that quarter was sold 
partially offsetting the decline in gross profit margin was the elimination of our discretionary profit sharing contribution related to production personnel for calendar year the gross profit margin of our equipment services segment was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the gross profit margin of our equipment services segment decreased in fiscal primarily due to general economic conditions  which have had an impact on used machine pricing and lower margins on our telehandlers and excavator replacement parts 
the gross profit margin of our access financial solutions segment increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily because of increased revenues resulting from the start up of this segment during the prior year period 
our selling  administrative and product development expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal and as a percent of revenues were for fiscal compared to for fiscal our machinery segment s selling  administrative and product development expenses increased million in fiscal due primarily to increased bad debt provisions for specific reserves related to certain customers  higher contract and consulting services  commission costs and incentive based accruals  which were partially offset by lower payroll and related costs and travel expenses due to our cost reduction initiatives 
our equipment services segment s selling and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal mainly due to lower payroll and related costs 
our access financial solutions segment s selling and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal due primarily to decreases in bad debt provisions reflecting lower origination activity and reduced non monetized portfolio exposure and lower software costs  which were partially offset by an increase in contract services expenses 
our general corporate selling  administrative and product development expenses decreased million in fiscal primarily due to reductions in bad debt provisions  consulting fees  depreciation expense  software costs and trade show expenses  which were partially offset by higher payroll and related costs  incentive based accruals and legal fees 
our selling  administrative and product development expenses as a percent of revenues were for fiscal compared to for fiscal in dollar terms  these expenses were million lower in fiscal than in fiscal our machinery segment s selling  administrative and product development expenses decreased million in fiscal due primarily to reductions in bad debt provisions  contract services and consulting expenses and the elimination of our discretionary profit sharing contribution related to selling and administrative personnel for calendar year our equipment services segment s selling and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal mainly due to increased payroll and related costs  freight expense and commission costs partially offset by the elimination of our discretionary profit sharing contribution related to selling and administrative personnel for calendar year our access financial solutions segment s selling and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal due primarily to costs associated with the start up of this business 
our general corporate selling  administrative and product development expenses increased million in fiscal primarily due to increased bad debt provisions for specific reserves related to certain customers  consulting expenses  costs associated with the vesting of stock awards  and costs related to establishing our shared service center in europe partially offset by lower pension charges  advertising expenses  payroll and related costs and the elimination of our discretionary profit sharing contribution 
prior year pension expense was higher due to the early retirement of three senior officers 
during fiscal  we announced further actions related to our ongoing longer term strategy to streamline operations and reduce fixed and variable costs 
as part of our capacity rationalization plan for our machinery segment that commenced in early  the  square foot sunnyside facility in bedford  pennsylvania  which produced selected scissor lift models  was temporarily idled and production integrated into our shippensburg  pennsylvania facility 
additionally  reductions in selling  administrative and product development costs will result from changes in our global organization and from process consolidations 
when these changes and consolidations are fully implemented  we expect to generate approximately million in annualized savings at a cost of million  representing a payback of approximately six months 
the announced plan contemplates that we will reduce a total of people globally and transfer production jobs from the sunnyside facility to the shippensburg facility 
as a result  pursuant to the plan we anticipate incurring a pre tax charge of million  consisting of million in restructuring costs associated with personnel reductions and employee relocation and lease and contract terminations and million in charges related to relocating certain plant assets and start up costs 
in addition  we will spend approximately million on capital requirements 
during fiscal  we incurred approximately million of this pre tax charge  consisting of accruals for termination benefit costs and relocation costs and charges related to relocating certain plant assets and start up costs and million on capital requirements 
we reported million in restructuring costs and million in cost of sales 
in addition  during fiscal  we paid and charged million of termination benefits and relocation costs against the accrued liability 
almost all of these expenses were cash charges 
we anticipate recording the remaining restructuring and restructuring related costs during our first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we announced the closure of our manufacturing facility in orrville  ohio as part of our capacity rationalization plan for our machinery segment 
operations at this facility have been integrated into our mcconnellsburg  pennsylvania facility 
as a result  through july   we have incurred a pre tax charge of million  consisting of million for termination benefits and lease termination costs  a million asset write down and million in charges related to relocating certain plant assets and start up costs associated with the move of the orrville operations to the mcconnellsburg facility 
during fiscal  we incurred million of the pre tax charge related to our closure of the orrville  ohio facility  consisting of production relocation costs  which were reported in cost of sales compared to million incurred during fiscal in addition  during fiscal  we paid and charged million of termination benefits and lease termination costs against the accrued liability 
during fiscal  we announced a repositioning plan that involved a pre tax charge of million 
of the million  approximately million was associated with the personnel reductions and plant closing  million reflected current period charges due to idle facilities associated with the fourth quarter production shutdowns and million was for the re valuation of used equipment inventory 
the remaining million included costs relating to reorganizing existing distribution relationships in europe and the pacific rim regions 
cash charges totaled million out of the million 
as part of the million  we recorded a restructuring charge of million to rationalize manufacturing capacity in our machinery segment and  of the remainder  million was reflected in cost of sales  million was recorded in selling  administrative and product development expenses  and million was reflected in miscellaneous  net 
the restructuring charge included the permanent closure of a manufacturing facility in bedford  pennsylvania resulting in a reduction of approximately people 
in addition  aligning our workforce with then current economic conditions at other facilities worldwide resulted in a further reduction of approximately people during the fourth quarter of fiscal for a total of people 
the increase in interest expense of million for fiscal was primarily due to the interest expense associated with our limited recourse and non recourse monetizations of million  increased rates on our senior subordinated debt and higher short term rates on our senior credit facilities 
the decrease in interest expense of million for fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in average borrowings under our credit facilities partially offset by the sale of million principal amount of senior subordinated notes in june discussed below 
our miscellaneous income deductions category included currency gains of million in fiscal compared to currency gains of million in fiscal and currency losses of million in fiscal the increase in currency gains for fiscal was primarily attributable to the significant weakening of the us dollar against the euro  british pound and australian dollar 
the increase in currency gains in fiscal is primarily attributable to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro during fiscal compared to fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we gained million from the sale of our interest in a brazilian joint venture  which was included in the miscellaneous income deductions category 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the current year s rate included a million benefit to net income  or 
per diluted share  resulting from a change in accounting estimate attributable to tax benefits received from foreign operations partially offset by the creation of a valuation allowance for certain foreign net operating losses 
since these represent changes in estimates  the anticipated effective tax rate in future years will not be as low as the current year 
the reduction in our effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal was principally due to the elimination of the amortization of goodwill  since the amortization of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes 
we were affected by the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of this accounting standard  we no longer amortize goodwill 
this led to the reduction of million in goodwill amortization during fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  goodwill amortization was million  primarily due to the gradall acquisition in in addition  during fiscal  we completed our review of our goodwill for impairment as required by sfas no 
and as a result  we recorded a transitional impairment loss  in accordance with the transition rules of sfas no 
 of million  or per share on a diluted basis  primarily associated with our gradall acquisition 
this write off was reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our consolidated statements of income 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimation  or complexity than other accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts and reserves for finance receivables we evaluate the collectibility of accounts and finance receivables based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
additional reserves are established based upon our perception of the quality of the current receivables  the current financial position of our customers and past experience of collectibility 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
income taxes we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we evaluate the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary allowances as required 
the carrying value of the net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  carry back opportunities  and tax planning strategies in making the assessment 
we evaluate the ability to realize the deferred tax assets and assess the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
in addition  the company is subject to income tax laws in many countries and judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the final outcome of these future tax consequences  tax audits  and changes in regulatory tax laws and rates could materially impact our financial statements 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
certain items in inventory may be considered impaired  obsolete or excess  and as such  we may establish an allowance to reduce the carrying value of these items to their net realizable value 
based on certain estimates  assumptions and judgments made from the information available at that time  we determine the amounts in these inventory allowances 
if these estimates and related assumptions or the market change  we may be required to record additional reserves 
goodwill we perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled million at july  and million at july  such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material negative change in a relationship with a significant customer 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others we enter into agreements with finance companies whereby our equipment is sold to a finance company  which  in turn  sells or leases it to a customer 
in some instances  we retain a liability in the event the customer defaults on the financing 
under certain terms and conditions where we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we establish a specific reserve against the liability 
additional reserves have been established related to these guarantees based upon the current financial position of these customers and based on estimates and judgments made from information available at that time 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
although we are liable for the entire amount under guarantees  our losses would be mitigated by the value of the underlying collateral  jlg equipment 
in addition  we monetize a substantial portion of the receivables originated by afs through an ongoing program of syndications  limited recourse financings and other monetization transactions 
in connection with some of these monetization transactions  we have limited recourse obligations of million as of july  related to possible defaults by the obligors under the terms of the contacts  which comprise these finance receivables 
allowances have been established related to these monetization transactions based upon the current financial position of these customers and based on estimates and judgments made from information available at that time 
if the financial condition of these obligors were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include technological advances  changes in our business model  capital strategy  economic conditions or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon  among other things  assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we would recognize an impairment loss 
we continually apply our best judgment when performing these valuations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
pension and postretirement benefits pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculation of these amounts 
these assumptions  used by actuaries  include discount rates  expected return on plan assets for funded plans  rate of salary increases  health care cost trend rates  mortality rates and other factors 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized to future periods and therefore affect recognized expense and recorded obligations in future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially effect our financial position or results of operations 
we expect that our pension and other postretirement benefits costs in fiscal will exceed the costs recognized in fiscal by approximately million 
this increase is principally attributable to the change in various assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return  discount rate  and health care cost trend rate 
product liability our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the use of equipment that we rent or sell 
we maintain insurance through a combination of self insurance retentions  primary insurance and excess insurance coverage 
we monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish liability reserves for the self insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims 
our liability estimates with respect to claims are based on internal evaluations of the merits of individual claims and the reserves assigned by our independent insurance claims adjustment firm 
the methods of making such estimates and establishing the resulting accrued liability are reviewed frequently  and adjustments resulting from our reviews are reflected in current earnings 
if these estimates and related assumptions change  we may be required to record additional reserves 
restructuring and restructuring related as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item part ii of this report  we recognized pre tax restructuring and restructuring related charges of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the related restructuring reserves reflect estimates  including those pertaining to separation costs  settlements of contractual obligations  and asset valuations 
we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan within the restructuring program at the end of each reporting period or as conditions change 
actual experience has been and may continue to be different from the estimates used to establish the restructuring reserves 
at july   we had liabilities established in conjunction with our restructuring activities of million and assets held for sale of million 
revenue recognition sales of equipment and service parts are unconditional sales that are recorded when product is shipped and invoiced to independently owned and operated distributors and customers 
normally our sales terms are free on board shipping point fob shipping point 
however  certain sales may be invoiced prior to the time customers take physical possession 
in such cases  revenue is recognized only when the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the equipment  the equipment has been completed and made available to the customer for pickup or delivery  and the customer has requested that we hold the equipment for pickup or delivery at a time specified by the customer 
in such cases  the equipment is invoiced under our customary billing terms  title to the units and risks of ownership passes to the customer upon invoicing  the equipment is segregated from our inventory and identified as belonging to the customer and we have no further obligations under the order 
during fiscal  approximately of our sales were invoiced and the revenue recognized prior to customers taking physical possession 
revenue from certain equipment lease contracts is accounted for as sales type leases 
the present value of all payments  net of executory costs such as legal fees  is recorded as revenue and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales 
the associated interest is recorded over the term of the lease using the interest method 
in addition  net revenues include rental revenues earned on the lease of equipment held for rental 
rental revenues are recognized in the period earned over the lease term 
warranty we establish reserves related to the warranties we provide on our products 
specific reserves are maintained for programs related to machine safety and reliability issues 
estimates are made regarding the size of the population  the type of program  costs to be incurred by us and estimated participation 
additional reserves are maintained based on the historical percentage relationships of such costs to machine sales and applied to current equipment sales 
if these estimates and related assumptions change  we may be required to record additional reserves 
financial condition cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal compared to cash generated from operating activities of million in fiscal the decrease in cash generated from operations in fiscal was primarily the result of our increased investment in finance receivables resulting from new originations  lower trade account payables largely resulting from the timing of payments and increased trade receivables resulting from an increase in the days sales outstanding from days at july  to days at july  the increase in the days sales outstanding was primarily the result of increases in outstanding rental purchase guarantees and european receivables 
partially offsetting these effects was a decrease in inventories 
the fiscal increase in cash generated from operations was primarily driven by a decrease of million in our inventory investment as we shut down production facilities to synchronize inventory and sales levels  and an increase in accounts payable as days purchasing outstanding increased to days at july  compared to days at july  the increase in accounts payable reflects production shutdowns during july due to the slowing economy and the resulting reduction in purchases 
partially offsetting these effects were increases in trade and finance receivables 
the increase in trade receivables principally reflects the termination of our receivables securitization agreement during february and the repurchase of any outstanding amounts under that agreement 
access financial solutions finance receivables increased due to monetization activities  which resulted in million in pledged receivables and the related limited recourse debt  offset by decreased lease obligations due to lower sales 
during fiscal  we used a net of million of cash for investing activities compared to million for fiscal our decrease in cash usage by investing activities for fiscal was principally due to lower expenditures for equipment held for rental and property  plant and equipment partially offset by a decrease in sales of equipment held for rental 
our decrease in cash usage by investing activities for fiscal was principally due to a decrease in purchases of rental fleet equipment and lower capital investments partially offset by the rental fleet sale leaseback transactions and the sale of our interest in our brazilian joint venture that occurred during fiscal we did not have any comparable transactions during fiscal we received net cash of million from financing activities for fiscal compared to net cash used of million for fiscal the increase in cash provided from financing activities largely resulted from increased debt  which included the sale of our million senior notes due and the proceeds from the monetization of our finance receivables  a portion of which was used to finance working capital requirements and the august  acquisition of omniquip 
the decrease in cash provided from financing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal largely resulted from lower borrowings under our credit facilities due to working capital reductions discussed above 
in addition  financing activities for fiscal included expenditures incurred to repurchase million shares of our capital stock at an aggregate cost of million 
we did not repurchase any of our stock in fiscal or fiscal partially offsetting the increase in cash used for financing activities was the proceeds from the sale of our million senior subordinated notes in june and the proceeds from the monetization of our finance receivables 
the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations in thousands at july  payments due by period less than after total year years years years short and long term debt a      limited recourse debt      operating leases b      total contractual obligations      a as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report  at july   we had a secured revolving credit facility with a group of financial institutions that provided an aggregate commitment of million and we also have a million secured bank revolving line of credit with a term of one year  renewable annually 
the credit facilities contained customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of specified consolidated interest coverage  leverage ratios and a minimum net worth 
if we were to become in default of these covenants  the financial institutions could call the loans 
while no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at july   during fiscal  our average outstanding borrowings under these facilities were million 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into new credit facilities described below 
b in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  operating lease obligations are not reflected in the balance sheet 
the following table provides a summary of our other commercial commitments in thousands at july  amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than over committed year years years years standby letters of credit   guarantees a     total commercial commitments      a we discuss our guarantee agreements in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
on august   we completed our acquisition of omniquip  which includes all operations relating to the sky trak and lull brand telehandler products 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
the purchase price was million  with million paid in cash at closing and million paid in the form of an unsecured subordinated promissory note due on the second anniversary of the closing date 
we funded the cash portion of the purchase price with remaining unallocated proceeds from the sale of our million senior notes and anticipate funding approximately million in transaction and integration expenses  including restructuring charges  with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our principle sources of liquidity for fiscal will be cash generated from operations  remaining proceeds from the may sale of our senior notes  borrowings under our credit facilities and monetizations of finance receivables originated by our access financial solutions segment 
availability of funds under our credit facilities and monetizations of finance receivables depend on a variety of factors described below 
on september   we entered into a new three year million senior secured revolving credit facility that replaces our previous million revolving credit facility and a pari passu  one year million cash management facility to replace our previous million secured bank revolving line of credit facility 
both facilities are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
availability of credit requires compliance with financial and other covenants  including during fiscal a requirement that we maintain leverage ratios of net funded debt to ebitda measured on a rolling four quarters and net funded senior debt to ebitda measured on a rolling four quarters not to exceed to and to  respectively  a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to  and a tangible net worth of a least million  plus of consolidated net income on a cumulative basis for each preceding fiscal quarter  commencing with the quarter ended july  availability of credit also will be limited by a borrowing base determined on a monthly basis by reference to of eligible domestic accounts receivable and percentages ranging between and of various categories of domestic inventory 
accordingly  credit available to us under these facilities will vary with seasonal and other changes in the borrowing base and leverage ratios  including changes resulting from completion of the accounting for the omniquip transaction and inclusion of omniquip financial performance into our results of operations 
we do not expect to have full availability of the stated maximum amount of credit at all times 
however  based on our current business plan  we expect to have sufficient credit availability that combined with cash to be generated from operations will meet our expected seasonal requirements for working capital and planned capital and integration expenditures for fiscal with the commencement of our access financial solutions segment in fiscal  we initially relied on cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our origination of customer finance receivables 
through this approach  we generated a diverse portfolio of financial assets which we seasoned and began to monetize principally through limited recourse syndications 
our ability to continue originations of finance receivables to be held by us as financial assets depends on the availability of monetizations  which  in turn  depends on the credit quality of our customers  the degree of credit enhancement or recourse that we are able to offer  and market demand among third party financial institutions for our finance receivables 
during fiscal and  we monetized and million  respectively  in finance receivables through syndications with different financial institutions 
although monetizations generate cash  under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  the monetized portion of our finance receivables portfolio remains recorded on our balance sheet as limited recourse debt 
beginning with fiscal  we expect that our originations and monetizations of finance receivables will continue  but at lower levels than in prior years  and that our limited recourse debt balance will begin to decline 
in september  we entered into a program agreement with ge dealer finance ge  a division of general electric capital corporation  to provide private label financing solutions for our customers 
under this agreement  our customers will continue to have direct interaction with our access financial solutions personnel  but with ge having the right to provide direct funding for transactions that meet agreed credit criteria subject to limited recourse to us 
transactions funded by ge will not be held by us as financial assets and therefore their subsequent monetization will not be recorded on our balance sheet as limited recourse debt 
transactions not funded by ge may still be funded by us to the extent of our liquidity sources and subsequently monetized or funded directly by other credit providers 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report  we are a party to multiple agreements whereby we guarantee million in indebtedness of others 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
our exposure to product liability claims is discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  item of part ii of this report 
future results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may be affected to the extent that our ultimate exposure with respect to product liability varies from current estimates 
there can be no assurance  that unanticipated events will not require us to increase the amount we have accrued for any matter or accrue for a matter that has not been previously accrued because it was not considered probable 
outlook this outlook section and other parts of this management s discussion and analysis contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are identified by words such as may  believes  expects  plans and similar terminology 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following i general economic and market conditions  including political and economic uncertainty in areas of the world where we do business  ii varying and seasonal levels of demand for our products and services  iii limitations on customer access to credit for purchases  iv credit risks from our financing of customer purchases  and v costs of raw materials and energy  as well as other risks as described in cautionary statements pursuant to the securities litigation reform act which is an exhibit to this report 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
the effects of the us economic recession resulted in a continued depression in the access industry  which has experienced staggering declines in market demand over the last three years causing many manufacturers to exit the market 
on a positive note  while north american non residential construction remains lackluster  vacancy rates are trending in the right direction and the pipeline of architectural planning continues to improve 
rental rates and utilization rates  critical metrics for our customers  are also showing signs of improving 
another favorable trend is reflected in the age of the rental fleets 
many of the larger rental companies have significantly aged their fleets during this downturn and are now anticipating the beginning of a refreshment cycle 
should the economic signs continue to improve  and our customers balance sheets improve  we expect fleet refreshment to be accelerated 
across the atlantic  the economy in europe has lagged the us and many of the markets are now in recession 
most of the customers in this region are smaller than the typical us customer resulting in conditions being even more challenging 
this has had the additional impact of a significant amount of relatively new used equipment coming to market as rental companies rationalize their fleets to rightsize for the current market conditions and reduce debt 
we have said many times that our customers willingness and ability to refresh their fleets depend on three factors 
the first two positive economic signals and a healthy used equipment market look favorable domestically 
the third  our customers ability to finance significant new purchases  remains the most challenging element yet to materialize as credit conditions continue to be very tight despite historically low interest rates 
overall  we anticipate that the spring and summer construction season of should show improvement in the us  while a european recovery may be up to a year behind 
market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
we manage exposure to these risks principally through our regular operating and financing activities 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our outstanding debt 
in june  we entered into a million fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with a fixed rate receipt of in order to mitigate our interest rate exposure 
the basis of the variable rate paid is the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
in july  we entered into a million fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with a fixed rate receipt of in order to mitigate our interest rate exposure 
the basis of the variable rate paid is the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
these swap agreements are designated as hedges of the fixed rate borrowings which are outstanding and are structured as perfect hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
during fiscal  we terminated our million notional fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement with a fixed rate receipt of that we entered into during june  which resulted in a deferred gain of million 
this million deferred gain will offset interest expense over the remaining life of the debt 
at july   we had million of interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
total interest bearing liabilities at july  consisted of million in variable rate borrowing and million in fixed rate borrowing 
at the current level of variable rate borrowing  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease pre tax current year earnings by approximately million on an annual basis 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not result in a material change in the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
we manufacture our products in the united states and belgium and sell these products in north america and europe as well as other international markets 
as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets  our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar  as compared to foreign currencies resulting from transactions in foreign markets 
at july   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would have the effect of reducing gross profits for the year ended july  by approximately million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
we enter into certain foreign currency contracts  principally forward exchanges  to manage some of our foreign exchange risk 
some natural hedges are also used to mitigate transaction and forecasted exposures 
at july   we were managing million of foreign currency contracts 
through our foreign currency hedging activities  we seek primarily to minimize the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of our products will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
during fiscal years  and  we entered into certain currency forward contracts to mitigate our economic risk to foreign exchange risk that qualify as derivative instruments under sfas no 
however  we have not designated these instruments as hedge transactions under sfas no 
and  accordingly  the mark to market impact of these derivatives is recorded each period to current earnings 
these foreign currency contracts have not historically been material to our financial position and results of operations
