item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fiscal consists of the fifty two weeks ended june  it compares with the fifty two weeks ended june   which constituted fiscal  and the fifty three weeks ended june   which constituted fiscal total revenue for fiscal was a record  an increase of  or percent above fiscal revenue 
comparable revenue from continuing operations excludes all revenue from hotel operations in fiscal was  including revenue of  contributed by the extra week 
net earnings for fiscal were a record  or diluted earnings per share eps of  compared to  or diluted eps of in fiscal comparable earnings from continuing operations excludes all transactions relating to hotel operations in fiscal were  or diluted eps of 
fiscal includes credits to earnings of   net after income tax  or 
diluted eps for impairment of assets 
the credits resulted from the dispositions of two big boy restaurants that had ceased operations in fiscal because of cash flow losses 
when these restaurants closed in fiscal  non cash pretax charges totaling   net after income tax  or 
diluted eps  including a write off of future long term lease obligations on one of the restaurants  were recorded as impairment losses 
the disposition of the leased restaurant property occurred during the first quarter of fiscal at which time  was credited back to impairment of assets 
the second restaurant was sold for cash during the third quarter of fiscal  and the  of excess proceeds over carrying value was credited to impairment of assets 
fiscal also included asset write offs recorded during the first quarter amounting to   net after income tax  or 
per diluted share 
these charges pertained principally to certain big boy restaurant building design costs that the company will no longer use  together with disposal costs for certain equipment removed from golden corral restaurants to make way for new great steaks buffet equipment 
the extra week in fiscal contributed  or 
diluted eps to earnings from continuing operations 
fiscal also benefited from a  gain  net after income tax  or 
diluted eps from the sale of certain unused big boy territorial franchise rights 
in addition  as noted above  fiscal was adversely impacted by impairment of assets charges 
net earnings for fiscal were  or diluted eps  which included earnings from discontinued hotel operations of  or 
diluted eps 
this included a net gain of  net of selling expenses and income tax or 
diluted eps from the disposal of the company s two hotels 
the company s revenues consist primarily of retail restaurant sales 
big boy restaurant sales also include wholesale sales from the company s commissary to restaurants licensed to other big boy operators  the amounts of which total less than percent of total revenue in all periods presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
total revenue also includes franchise and other fees  the amounts of which were not material to fiscal or fiscal the gain from the sale of franchise rights in fiscal  as noted above  was included in other revenue 
references to sales or revenue in the discussion that follows refer to restaurant sales including the minimal amounts of wholesale sales discussed above 
results of operations the discussion of results of operations compares the results of operations of fiscal to fiscal and to comparable results from continuing operations excludes all transactions relating to hotel operations in fiscal consolidated sales during fiscal reached a record  increasing  or percent above sales for fiscal  and were  higher than fiscal golden corral contributed  to the consolidated sales total in fiscal  rising  or percent above fiscal  and  
table of contents higher than fiscal big boy sales were  in fiscal  increasing  or percent higher than fiscal  and  more than fiscal the golden corral sales increases were primarily the result of more restaurants in operation in operation at beginning of year opened during the year in operation at end of year total sales weeks one new restaurant opened in each of the cincinnati  louisville  dayton and cleveland markets during fiscal three golden corral restaurants were under construction as of june  construction of another golden corral began in july  these four restaurants should open respectively in july  august  september and november of plans for two more are currently underway that will bring the total to golden corral restaurants in operation by the end of fiscal golden corral same store sales decreased percent during fiscal a percent increase in golden corral same store sales was achieved for the fourth quarter of fiscal the third quarter experienced a percent decrease that resulted from foul winter weather patterns in february 
the introduction of the great steaks buffet in golden corral restaurants was completed during the second quarter of fiscal the conversion of the hot bars allowed the company to charge an extra dollar for the basic buffet 
the great steaks buffet concept features all you can eat charbroiled steaks served on the buffet 
when comparing immediate pre conversion store by store weekly sales to weekly sales immediately following the rollout  average weekly sales increased almost percent 
other menu price increases implemented during the three years ended june  included a percent hike in february of and a 
percent increase in february of reporting of golden corral same store sales comparisons was begun in fiscal even though the company believes that same store sales comparisons for golden corral restaurants are not very meaningful at this stage of the concept s development 
following general industry practice  the above mentioned same store sales comparisons include only those restaurants that had been open for five full fiscal quarters prior to the start of the comparison periods 
accordingly  only eight restaurants are included in the fiscal comparison  whereas a total of twenty golden corral restaurants were in operation at the end of fiscal the fourth and third quarter comparisons included thirteen and twelve restaurants  respectively 
additionally  it should be noted that more than half of the golden corral restaurants included in the same store sales calculations are in the cincinnati market where the company built its first five golden corrals and now has ten in operation 
until markets are built out and each restaurant establishes its own permanent customer base  the sales of the existing restaurants are often adversely affected  albeit temporarily  as the company opens additional restaurants in the market 
finally  same store sales comparisons for golden corrals reflect the launch  late in the first quarter of fiscal  of the company s first golden corral television advertising campaign to promote the great steaks buffet concept and the price increase associated with it  as discussed in a preceding paragraph 
same store sales in big boy restaurants increased percent during fiscal  marking the sixth consecutive year that big boy same store sales increases have been achieved 
the percentage increase in dining room sales exceeded the increase in carryout and drive thru sales  reversing a trend established five years earlier 
severe winter weather in february caused a same store sales decline in the third quarter  ending a streak of consecutive quarters that big boy same store sales gains had been achieved 
big boy same store sales increased percent during fiscal and percent in fiscal the extra week in fiscal was excluded in calculating the percentage increase of all same store sales 
the same store sales comparisons include average menu price increases of percent  percent and percent  respectively  during the third quarters of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal the first quarters of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal included average menu price increases of percent  percent and percent  respectively 
another price increase will be implemented near the end of the first quarter of fiscal since the beginning of fiscal  five new big boy restaurants have been opened  two of which were replacement buildings built upon the same site  while three older  under performing restaurants were permanently closed 
the company currently operates big boy restaurants  effectively unchanged since the beginning of fiscal 
table of contents construction of two new big boy restaurants  one of which will relocate an existing restaurant to a superior site within the same neighborhood  is expected to begin later in calendar year the percentages used in the following discussion about food cost  payroll and other operating costs are percentages of restaurant sales as defined in a previous paragraph rather than of total revenue 
fiscal gc fiscal gc fiscal gc total big boy total big boy total big boy sales food and paper payroll and related other operating costs including opening costs gross profit menu price hikes in all three years helped drive food and paper cost percentages downward for big boy restaurants 
lower costs of certain commodities  especially beef  pork and dairy products added to the reduction in fiscal commodity pricing can be difficult to predict over the long term 
the food and paper cost percentages for golden corral restaurants  while much higher than in big boy restaurants because of the all you can eat nature of the golden corral concept  also benefited from lower commodity costs  particularly beef and pork 
adding to the fiscal reduction was the effect of the higher price point from the great steaks buffet  as it outweighed the increased cost of added beef consumption 
effective management of the offerings on the food bar can be used to a degree to help offset any future spikes in commodity prices that may occur 
payroll and related cost percentages for big boy restaurants continued to move higher in fiscal  repeating the fiscal increase over fiscal several factors are responsible for the increased percentages in fiscal and fiscal first  in both years there was an increase in service hours worked in relation to hours of operation 
second  in both years variable compensation earned by restaurant management was greater than levels paid during the previous year 
third  higher costs for pension and medical plan coverage were incurred in fiscal and fiscal these higher cost percentages were partly offset in both years by lower average pay rates and higher menu prices 
significantly lower payroll and related cost percentages for golden corral restaurants were achieved in fiscal  due to the combination of higher menu prices  lower pay rates and a significant reduction in the number of hours worked  offset by higher levels of variable compensation and the cost of medical plan coverage 
the reduction in the number of hours worked was the result of management focus that was set in place after the payroll and related cost percentage had increased in fiscal over fiscal reflected in the payroll and related cost percentages discussed above are certain adjustments to self insurance liabilities to more closely reflect actual claims experience 
self insured claims experience is reviewed annually during the first quarter 
the assumptions used to measure these adjustments can be complex and sometimes require management to exercise considerable judgment 
however  management does not consider the adjustments made during the annual review to be critical to the fair presentation of the company s financial condition or its results of operations 
favorable claims experience allowed self insurance liabilities to be lowered by  during fiscal and by  in fiscal in fiscal   was charged against earnings in the second quarter to increase self insurance liabilities information available at the end of last year s first quarter was inconclusive   of which was reversed in the th quarter 

table of contents the fair value of the assets in the company s defined benefit pension plans has been adversely affected by poor returns on equity investments 
the result has increased the company s pension expense after many years of steady  low costs 
the net periodic pension cost computed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
was   and  respectively  in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal contributions to these plans were   and  respectively  during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal net periodic pension cost for fiscal is projected at over  fiscal contributions to the plans are expected to exceed  in the near term  the company believes it is unlikely that federal legislation will be enacted to raise the minimum wage 
however  if such legislation were to be enacted  the company would counter the effects with higher menu prices  together with tighter payroll standards and a reduction in hours worked 
other operating costs include occupancy costs such as maintenance  rent  depreciation  property tax  insurance and utilities  field supervision  accounting and payroll preparation costs  franchise fees for golden corral restaurants  opening costs and many other restaurant operating expenses 
as these expenses tend to be more fixed in nature  sales increases normally cause these costs to be a lower percentage of sales  as reflected in the fiscal percentages when compared to fiscal however  other operating cost percentages for big boy and golden corral restaurants moved upward during fiscal principally due to higher maintenance and depreciation charges  along with certain write offs for the cost of the abandoned design plans for the big boy prototype restaurant building that was introduced in fiscal and for certain equipment removed from service to make way for new great steaks buffet equipment in golden corral restaurants 
significant charges for new restaurant opening costs were incurred in all three years 
opening costs for big boy restaurants were   and  respectively  during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal for golden corral restaurants  opening costs were   and  respectively  in fiscal  fiscal and were fiscal results for fiscal were favorably affected by credits to impairment of assets totaling  that resulted from the dispositions of two former big boy restaurants 
the credits reflect the over estimation of impairment charges recorded when the restaurants were permanently closed in fiscal no impairments of assets were recorded in fiscal administrative and advertising expense increased  during fiscal or percent higher than fiscal  and was  higher than fiscal the largest component of these increases is higher spending for advertising and marketing that is proportionate with higher sales levels  reflecting the company s long standing policy to spend a constant percentage of big boy and golden corral sales on advertising and marketing 
other components of the fiscal increase over fiscal and fiscal include the costs to litigate the matter of defective construction of a golden corral restaurant in canton  ohio and higher accruals for executive incentive compensation commensurate with higher pretax earnings 
interest expense during fiscal increased  or percent higher than fiscal  and was  higher than fiscal the increase reflects the full effect of having borrowed  in fiscal  together with much lower levels of capitalized interest this year from scaled back construction  offset somewhat by lower variable interest rates and much lower additional borrowing in fiscal interest expense is expected to remain steady in fiscal due to significant payments against installment loans that will largely offset the effects of additional borrowing in fiscal income tax expense as a percentage of pretax earnings was percent in fiscal  percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal these rates have been kept consistently low through the company s use of tax credits  principally the federal credits allowed for employer social security and medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips and the work opportunity tax credit 
critical accounting policies two factors are required for an accounting policy to be deemed critical 
the policy must be significant to the fair presentation of a company s financial condition and its results of operations  and the policy must require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
management believes that its policy used in accounting for the impairment of long lived assets is the company s only critical accounting policy because of its 
table of contents potential for significant impact on financial condition and results of operations 
a discussion of this policy can be found under the property and equipment caption of note a to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically maintained a strategic negative working capital position  a common practice in the restaurant industry 
the working capital deficit was  as of june  as of june   the deficit was  despite this year s decrease  the working capital deficit is expected to increase over the next few years at a modest  manageable pace as construction debt is prudently increased to supplement the use of internally generated cash to finance expansion plans

it is the company s policy to own the land on which it builds new restaurants  however  it is sometimes necessary to enter ground leases to obtain desirable land on which to build 
three golden corral restaurants have been built on 
table of contents leased land  including one that opened in fiscal in addition  the company has entered into two more ground leases for future development of golden corral restaurants 
all of these leases have been accounted for as operating leases pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases as amended

since october   the company has had a stock repurchase program 
the program was most recently renewed in october  the current program authorizes the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock over a period of time not to exceed two years from the date of the authorization 
shares may be acquired in the open market or through block trades 
due to the positive movement in the stock price since december   no shares have been acquired under these programs since january  proceeds of  were received during fiscal from employees who acquired  shares of the company s common stock through exercise of stock options

twenty restaurants were in operation as of june   including four that opened in fiscal current plans call for six additional restaurants to open by the end of fiscal  three of which were under construction as of june  costs remaining to complete construction of these three restaurants were estimated at  as of june  on average  the cost to build and equip each golden corral restaurant is approximately  including land 
the latest golden corral restaurant to open january  was the replacement of a defective restaurant building in canton  ohio 
the defective building had originally been expected to be placed in service in september  its construction was halted in august  when structural defects were discovered 
the company has asserted claims against two firms with which the company had contracted for the design  engineering and construction of the defective building 
the company expects to recover at least  in construction costs incurred to date  including the cost to raze the defective building 
construction of two big boy restaurants should be underway later in calendar year land has yet to be acquired for one of the new restaurants 
the approximate cost to build and equip a new big boy restaurant is  including land 
approximately one fifth of the company s big boy restaurants are routinely renovated or decoratively updated each year

table of contents food safety is the most significant risk to any company that operates in the restaurant industry 
it has become the focus of increased government regulatory initiatives at the local  state and federal levels resulting in higher compliance costs to the company 
to limit the company s exposure to the risk of food contamination  management rigorously emphasizes and enforces the company s food safety policies in all of the company s restaurants  and at the commissary and food manufacturing plant that the company operates for big boy restaurants 
these policies are designed to work cooperatively with programs established by health agencies at all levels of government authority  including the federal hazard analysis of critical control points haccp program 
in addition  the company makes use of servsafe training  a nationally recognized program developed by the national restaurant association 
the servsafe program provides accurate  up to date science based information to all levels of restaurant workers on all aspects of food handling  from receiving and storing to preparing and serving 
all restaurant managers are required to receive re certification in servsafe training every five years 
other examples of risks and uncertainties facing the company include  but are not limited to  the following intense competition for customers  consumer perceptions of value  food quality and quality of service  changing consumer preferences  changing neighborhood demographics  changes in business strategy and development plans  the rising cost of quality sites on which to build restaurants  poor selection of restaurant sites  the effects of inflationary pressure  including higher energy prices  rolling power outages  shortages of qualified labor  changes in the supply and cost of food  seasonal weather conditions  particularly during the winter months of the third quarter  natural disasters  fires or explosions  criminal acts  including bomb threats  robberies  hostage taking  kidnapping and other violent crimes  acts of terrorists or acts of war  civil disturbances  boycotts  variable interest rates  limitations on borrowing capacity  legal claims  changes in accounting standards  estimates used in preparing financial statements  disruptions to the business during transitions to new computer software  financial stability of technology vendors to support computer software over the long term  changes in governmental regulations regarding the environment  exposure to penalties for potential violations of numerous governmental regulations in general  and immigration i and minor labor regulations in particular  any future imposition by osha of costly ergonomics regulations on workplace safety  legislative changes affecting labor law  especially increases in the federal minimum wage  and legislation or court rulings that result in changes to tax codes 
the company continually takes reasonable preventive measures to reduce its risks and uncertainties 
however  the nature of some risks and uncertainties leaves the company with little control 
the materialization of any of the risks and uncertainties identified herein  together with those risks not specifically listed or those that are presently unforeseen  could result in significant adverse effects on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows  which could include the permanent closure of the affected restaurant s with an impairment of assets charge taken against earnings
