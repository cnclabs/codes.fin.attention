item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview we are a multi state managed health care company focused on serving people who receive health care benefits through public sponsored programs  including medicaid  schip and familycare 
we were founded in december with the objective to become the leading managed care organization in the united states focused on serving people who receive these types of benefits 
the following table sets forth the approximate number of our members in each of our service areas for the periods presented 
december market houston dallas fort worth new jersey maryland district of columbia chicago total effective january   we acquired the outstanding stock of php holdings  inc and its subsidiary physicians healthcare plans  inc together php 
with the acquisition of php  we began providing our products to approximately  additional members located in three flordia markets  tampa  orlando and ft 
lauderdale miami 
discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate to provide health benefits to our members 
we generally receive premiums in advance of providing services  and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members consistent with industry standards 
we also generate revenues from investments 
we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month to provide health care benefits to our members pursuant to our contracts in each of our markets 
in our texas  new jersey  maryland and the district of columbia markets we receive payments under each state s obstetric delivery supplements program 
upon delivery of a newborn  each state is invoiced a predetermined amount according to our contract 
we recognize revenue in the period in which the birth occurs 
any amounts that have not been received from the state by the end of the period remain on the balance sheet classified as premium receivables 
estimating health benefits expense and claims payable our results of operations depend on our ability to effectively manage expenses related to health benefits as well as our ability to accurately predict costs incurred in recording the amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
expenses related to health benefits have two components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include fees paid to hospitals  physicians and providers of 
table of contents ancillary medical services  such as pharmacy  laboratory  radiology  dental and vision 
medically related administrative costs include expenses related to services such as health promotion  quality assurance  case management  disease management and hour on call nurses 
direct medical expenses also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
for the year ended december   approximately of our direct medical payments related to fees paid on a fee for service basis to our primary care physicians  specialist physicians and ancillary providers  including fees paid to third party vendors for ancillary services such as pharmacy  mental health  dental and vision benefits 
the balance related to fees paid on a capitation  or per member  basis 
primary care and specialist physicians not paid on a capitated basis are paid on a maximum allowable fee schedule set forth in the contracts with our providers 
we reimburse hospitals on a negotiated fixed dollar amount per day or an agreed upon percent of their standard charges 
in maryland  the state sets the amount reimbursed to hospitals 
monthly  we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors  including authorization data and prior claims experience 
authorization data is information captured in our medical management system  which identifies services requested by providers or members 
the medical cost related to these authorizations is estimated by pricing the approved services using contractual or historical amounts adjusted for known variables such as historical claims trends 
these estimated costs are included as a component of ibnr 
as part of this review  we also consider the costs to process medical claims  and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in claims payment patterns  membership  products  and authorization trends 
in addition  claims processing costs are accrued based on an estimate of the costs necessary to process unpaid claims 
these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available  and as adjustments are made  differences are included in current operations 
we utilize the services of independent actuarial consultants who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly 
the balance of claims payable is significant in relation to the consolidated financial statements 
judgments are made based on knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about future events 
there is a likelihood that actual results could be materially different if different assumptions or conditions prevail 
the following table shows the components of the change in medical costs payable for the years ended december   and in thousands medical claims payable as of january health benefits expenses incurred during period related to current year related to prior years total incurred health benefits payments during period related to current year related to prior years total payments medical claims payable as of december changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years recognized during   and were attributable to lower than anticipated utilization of medical services 
we believe that the amount of claims payable is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates 
assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimates of claims payable and actual 
table of contents claims payable  net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million and diluted earnings per share would increase or decrease by approximately per share 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating ratios for each year in the three year period ending december  all ratios  with the exception of the health benefits ratio  are shown as a percentage of total revenues 
premium revenue investment income total revenues health benefits selling  general and administrative expenses income before income taxes net income the health benefits ratio is shown as a percentage of premium revenue because there is a direct relationship between the premium received and the health benefits provided 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues premium revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to  million from million for the year ended december  the increase was principally due to internal growth in overall membership and to a lesser extent  the acquisition of the medicaid contracts and related assets of humana s houston  texas business in august  members  methodistcare s houston  texas business in january  members and the acquisition of the medicaid line of business of capital community health plan of washington  dc in july  members 
total membership increased to  as of december  from  as of december  investment income decreased million to million for the year ended december  the decrease in investment income is primarily due to the continued decline in market interest rates and increased levels of tax advantaged securities partially offset by an increase in overall cash and investments levels throughout the year 
cash and investments levels have primarily increased due to proceeds from our initial public offering  cash generated from operations and increases in the amount of premiums received versus the timing of the payment of the related health benefits

we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
in conjunction with the offering  all series a  b  c and d preferred stock in the aggregate was converted into  shares of common stock 
we used proceeds from the offering to repay the balance of our long term debt facility of approximately million and to redeem our series e mandatorily redeemable preferred stock for approximately million 
in addition   shares of common stock were issued upon the exercise of all outstanding series e warrants 
cash from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash from operations is primarily due to increases in membership  improvements to operating margins and the impact of a prepayment of revenue received in attributable to operations in as of december   we had working capital including long term investments of million as compared to million at december  due primarily to the placement of cash in escrow for the acquisition of php in the amount of million 
our minimum lease payments under all noncancelable operating leases are million for cash used in investing activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an escrow deposit in connection with the acquisition of php and related costs of million as well as purchases of property  equipment and software of million 
we anticipate that our purchases of property and equipment and software will be approximately million 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities 
the average maturity is less than nine months 
we utilize investment vehicles such as municipal bonds  commercial paper  us government backed agencies  and us treasury instruments 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest their cash

on august   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the common stock of php holdings  inc and its subsidiary  physicians healthcare plans  inc together php 
the acquisition became effective january  the total acquisition price was approximately million  including acquisition costs 
we did not acquire php s careplus health plan  spun off from php at the end of  which will continue to serve its medicare and commercial lines of business 
the cash purchase price of approximately million was placed in escrow at december  approximately million of the cash purchase price was financed through our existing credit facility with the balance funded through available unrestricted cash 
this acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
goodwill and other intangibles totaling million includes million of identifiable intangibles allocated to the membership purchased and a non compete agreement 
with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangibles sfas  goodwill and other intangibles assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but instead subject to impairment tests 
identifiable intangibles with definite useful lives are being amortized based on the timing of related cash flows with an expected amortization of to years 
the estimated acquisition cost allocation between goodwill and identifiable intangible assets is million and million  respectively 
we have not yet finalized our fair value analysis  therefore  the allocation of the purchase price is subject to refinement 
as of january   php served approximately  medicaid and schip members in counties of three florida metropolitan areas of orlando  tampa and ft 
lauderdale miami 
effective july   we purchased the medicaid line of business of capital community health plan for approximately million including acquisition costs

cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of proceeds from our revolving credit facility of million compared to  which included proceeds from the offering partially offset by principal payments on our long term debt facility and the redemption of our series e preferred stock 
our minimum lease payments under all capital leases are million for on december   we entered into a million revolving credit facility  with three banks 
in july  a fourth bank was added  thereby increasing the revolving credit facility to million 
the proceeds of the facility will be available for general corporate purposes  including  without limitation  permitted acquisitions 
the facility will accrue interest at one of the following rates  at our option libor plus the applicable margin or an alternate bank rate plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin for libor borrowings is between and and the applicable margin for alternate base rate borrowings is between and 
the applicable margin will vary depending on our leverage ratio 
the facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of amerigroup corporation  including the stock of its subsidiaries 
there is a commitment fee of on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility matures december  as of december   there was million outstanding under the credit facility at a rate of  which represents libor plus 
our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum statutory capital requirements prescribed by various jurisdictions  including the departments of insurance in each of the states in which we operate 
as of december   our subsidiaries were in compliance with all minimum statutory capital requirements 
we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements for the next twelve months 
at december   we served members who received health care benefits through nine contracts with the regulatory entities in the jurisdictions in which we operated  four of which individually accounted for or more of our revenues for the year ended december   with the largest of these contracts representing approximately of our revenues 
if any of our contracts were not renewed or were terminated for cause or if we were to lose a contract in a re bidding process  our business would suffer 
with the acquisition of php on january   we serve members who receive health care benefits through a total of sixteen contracts with the regulatory entities 
we believe that internally generated funds and available funds under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to support continuing operations  capital expenditures and our growth strategy for at least months

we have adopted the disclosure requirements of fin as required for fiscal years ending after december  and will adopt the provisions for initial recognition and measurement for all guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of fin no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
 which addresses the financial accounting and reporting of costs associated with an exit activity including restructuring or with a disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
is effective prospectively after december  our management does not believe the implementation of this standard will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which include hmos and one managed care organization  or mco 
hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that  among other things  may require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their stockholders 
as of december   our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of approximately million 
the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  has adopted rules which  to the extent that they are implemented by the states  will set new minimum capitalization requirements for insurance companies  hmos and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage 
the requirements take the form of risk based capital rules 
the change in rules for insurance companies became effective as of december  the new hmo rules  which may vary from state to state  are currently being considered for adoption 
illinois and texas adopted various forms of the rules as of december  and  respectively 
maryland adopted risk based capital rules for mcos as of december  however  maryland exempted all mcos from the rules for the years ended december  and new jersey and florida have not yet adopted risk based capital 
the naic s hmo rules  if adopted by other states in their proposed form  may increase the minimum capital required for our subsidiaries 
inflation although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and health care cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national health care cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of health care services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate health care cost inflation will continue to be successful  competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from health care providers and customers  applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost increases 
compliance costs the federal regulations promulgated under hipaa relating to privacy  standard transactions and security were issued in proposed form in final regulations were subsequently issued with compliance dates of april for privacy  october for transactions and april for security 
the final security rule was issued in 
table of contents february and we have not fully assessed the cost of complying with these regulations 
the fact that either state or federal rules may supersede the other depending on the nature of the particular requirement will require interpretations for which there is likely to be little precedent 
we have completed an assessment of the programs and systems that we will need to implement in order to comply with the new privacy regulations by april in order to comply with the requirements  we will be required to employ additional or different programs and systems 
we had expenditures of approximately million on hipaa compliance in and expect an additional million in we expect to be fully compliant by the required compliance dates 
further  compliance with these regulations are requiring changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business  which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  we will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new regulations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  we had short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
these investments consist of highly liquid investments with maturities between three and twenty four months 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
credit risk is managed by investing in money market funds  us treasury securities  cash escrow accounts  asset backed securities  debt securities of government sponsored entities  municipal bonds and auction rate securities 
our investment policies are subject to revision based upon market conditions and our cash flow and tax strategies  among other factors 
we have the ability to hold these investments to maturity  and as a result  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 

table of contents risk factors risks related to being a regulated entity changes in government regulations designed to protect providers and members rather than our stockholders could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 
our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government 
these laws and regulations are generally intended to benefit and protect providers and health plan members rather than stockholders 
congress is currently considering legislation to reform medicaid 
we cannot predict what impact such legislation  if adopted  would have on our business 
changes in existing laws and rules  the enactment of new laws and rules and changing interpretations of these laws and rules could  among other things force us to change how we do business  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  increase our health care and administrative costs  impose additional capital requirements  and increase or change our liability 
if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us  it may negatively affect our business strategy 
we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of  or notification to  state regulators 
if the regulators were to deny our subsidiaries requests to pay dividends to us  the funds available to our company as a whole would be limited  which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 
regulations may limit the extent to which we can increase our profits as a percentage of revenues 
our new jersey and maryland subsidiaries are subject to minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium revenue 
in new jersey  contractual sanctions may be imposed if these levels are not met 
in addition  our texas plans are required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels 
these regulatory requirements  changes in these requirements and additional requirements by our other regulators may limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues  which may harm our operating results 
we have been required  and may in the future be required  to make payments to the states as a result of not meeting these expense and profit levels 
our failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties and limitations on our profitability 
violation of the laws or regulations governing our operations could result in the imposition of sanctions  the cancellation of our contracts to provide services  or in the extreme case  the suspension or revocation of our licenses 
for example  in two markets in which we operate we are required to spend a minimum percentage of our premium revenue on medical expenses 
in one market  if we fail to comply with this requirement  we could be required to pay monetary damages 
additionally  we could be required to file a corrective plan of action with the state and we could be subject to further fines and additional corrective measures if we did not comply with the corrective plan of action 
in the other market  our failure to comply could affect future rate determinations 
these regulations may limit the profits we can obtain 
in the past we have been subject to sanctions as a result of violations of marketing regulations and timeliness of payment requirements 
for example  in august  our chicago  illinois plan was notified by the illinois department of public aid  or idpa  that its office of inspector general had commenced an investigation 
table of contents of allegations of misrepresentation and fraud by marketing representatives employed by our plan 
we developed a corrective action plan to identify and correct past marketing improprieties and to reduce the likelihood of future violations  which has been approved by idpa and implemented 
under our contract with idpa  sanctions could be imposed  ranging from  to  and or our right to enroll members could be suspended for a period of time  if the allegations are substantiated 
we do not know if we will be informed as to when the investigation has been completed 
while we have not been subject to any fines or violations that were material  we cannot assure you that we will not become subject to material fines or other sanctions in the future 
if we became subject to material fines or if other sanctions or other corrective actions were imposed upon us  our ability to continue to operate our business could be materially and adversely affected 
on october   we responded to a civil investigative demand  or cid  of the hmo industry by the office of the attorney general of the state of texas relating to processing of provider claims 
we understand from the office of the attorney general that responses were required from the nine largest hmos in texas  of which we are the ninth 
the other eight are hmos that primarily provide commercial products 
the cid is being conducted in connection with allegations of unfair contracting  delegating and payment practices and violations of the texas deceptive trade practices consumer protection act and article of the texas insurance code by hmos 
in meetings with representatives of the attorney general  they agreed that our required response would be limited to providing information relating to our payment of hospital claims only 
in addition  based upon our discussions with the office of the attorney general  it is our understanding that we are not currently the target of any investigation by that office 
on october  we filed our response to the cid including all information that we believed was required to be produced 
on october   we received a request from the office of the attorney general that we clarify and supplement certain of our responses 
we responded with a second filing on december  and three supplemental filings thereafter 
these additional filings were materials provided for classification of the original submission and were not the result of an expansion of the scope of the cid 
the office of the attorney general could request additional information or clarification which could be costly and time consuming for us to produce 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to health care companies 
hipaa created civil penalties for  among other things  billing for medically unnecessary goods or services 
hipaa establishes new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse  including a whistle blower program 
further  a new regulation promulgated pursuant to hipaa imposes civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with the health records privacy standards set forth in the regulation 
the department of health and human services  or hhs  press release related to the new regulation calls on congress to enact legislation to fortify penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa 
the preamble to the new privacy regulation indicates that hhs intends to issue an enforcement rule related to the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa 
enforcement of the privacy regulations is handled under the office of civil rights 
the federal government has enacted  and state governments are enacting  other fraud and abuse laws as well 
our failure to comply with hipaa or these other laws could result in criminal or civil penalties and exclusion from medicaid or other governmental health care programs and could lead to the revocation of our licenses 
these penalties or exclusions  were they to occur  would negatively impact our ability to operate our business 
compliance with new federal and state rules and regulations may require us to make unanticipated expenditures 
in august  hhs issued a new regulation under hipaa requiring the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
we are required to comply with the new transactions regulation by october also in august  hhs 
table of contents proposed a regulation that would require health care participants to implement organizational and technical practices to protect the security of electronically maintained or transmitted health related information 
this security regulation  finalized in february  requires compliance by april in december  hhs issued a new regulation mandating heightened privacy and confidentiality protections under hipaa which became effective on april  requires compliance by april however  states may seek exemptions from the requirements of the privacy regulation for certain state laws  and state laws that impose stricter privacy standards than the hipaa privacy regulation will not be preempted 
in january  the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  published new federal regulations regarding medicaid managed care 
on june   cms published final regulations that replaced the january regulations in their entirety 
the final regulations implement requirements of the balanced budget act of that are intended to give states more flexibility in their administration of medicaid managed care programs  provide certain new patient protections for medicaid managed care enrollees  and require states rates to meet new actuarial soundness requirements 
the effective date of the regulation was august  and states must comply with these regulations by august  the states ability to promulgate stricter rules  and uncertainty regarding many aspects of the regulations make compliance with the relatively new regulatory landscape difficult 
our existing programs and systems may not enable us to comply in all respects with these new regulations 
we have completed an assessment of the programs and systems that we will need to implement in order to comply with the new regulations 
in order to comply with the regulatory requirements  we will be required to employ additional or different programs and systems 
we had expenditures of approximately million on hipaa compliance in and expect an additional million in to become fully compliant 
further  compliance with these pervasive regulations will require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business  which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  we will be able to recover our costs of complying with these new regulations from the states 
the new regulations and the related costs to comply with the new regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
changes in health care laws may reduce our profitability 
numerous proposals relating to changes in health care law have been introduced  some of which have been passed by congress and the states in which we operate or may operate in the future 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time 
we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business 
although some of the recent changes in government regulations  such as the removal of the requirements on the enrollment mix between commercial and public sector membership  have encouraged managed care participation in public sector programs  we are unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will continue to favor or hinder the growth of managed health care 
a recent example is state and federal legislation which would enable physicians to collectively bargain with managed health care organizations 
the legislation  as currently proposed  generally contains an exemption for public sector managed health care organizations 
if legislation of this type were passed without this exemption  it would negatively impact our bargaining position with many of our providers and might result in an increase in our cost of providing medical benefits 
we cannot predict the outcome of these legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the effect which they might have on us 
legislation or regulations that require us to change our current manner of operation  provide additional benefits or change our contract arrangements may seriously harm our operations and financial results 
reductions in medicaid funding by the states could substantially reduce our profitability 
most of our revenues come from state government medicaid premiums 
the base premium rate paid by each state differs  depending on a combination of various factors such as defined upper payment limits  a member s 
table of contents health status  age  sex  county or region  benefit mix and member eligibility categories 
future levels of medicaid premium rates may be affected by continued government efforts to contain medical costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints 
changes to medicaid programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
states periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid 
we believe that additional reductions in medicaid payments could substantially reduce our profitability 
further  our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state in the event of unavailability of state funds 
in some jurisdictions  such cancellation may be immediate and in other jurisdictions a notice period is required 
state governments generally are experiencing budgetary shortfalls 
budget problems in the states in which we operate could result in limited increases or even decreases in the premiums paid to us by the states 
in  the state of illinois  which accounts for approximately of our total membership  reduced the medicaid premiums it pays to managed care companies due to state budgetary concerns 
if illinois or any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us  or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends  it would have a material negative impact on our profitability 
if state governments do not renew our contracts with them on favorable terms  our business will suffer 
at december   we served members who received health care benefits through nine contracts with the regulatory entities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
four of these contracts individually accounted for or more of our revenues for the year ended december   with the largest of these contracts representing approximately of our revenues 
if any of our contracts were not renewed on favorable terms or were terminated for cause or if we were to lose a contract in a re bidding process  our business would suffer 
most of our contracts expire in and have renewal provisions 
termination or non renewal of any one contract could materially impact our revenues and operating results 
some of our contracts are subject to a re bidding process 
for example  we are subject to a re bidding process in each of our three texas markets and for our schip contracts in each of our three florida markets 
our texas markets are re bid every six years and is scheduled to occur in in florida  our schip contracts have staggered contract periods by county and are re bid every two to four years 
our operating results would suffer as a result of losing a contract through the re bidding process 
if a state fails to renew its federal waiver application for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied  our membership in that state will likely decrease 
states may only mandate medicaid enrollment into managed care under federal waivers or demonstrations 
waivers and programs under demonstrations are approved for two year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies 
we have no control over this renewal process 
if a state does not renew its mandated program or the federal government denies the state s application for renewal  our business would suffer as a result of a likely decrease in membership 
we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by the government 
inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations 
premium payments to us are based upon eligibility lists produced by the government 
a state could require us to reimburse it for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that the state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program 
alternatively  a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment 
we are also exposed to these risks when we are a subcontractor to parties that rely on government eligibility lists 
our results of operations would suffer as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 

table of contents growth in the number of medicaid beneficiaries during economic downturns could negatively impact our profitability if state budgets decrease or do not increase 
less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits 
however  during such economic downturns  state budgets could decrease  causing states to attempt to cut health care programs  benefits or rates 
if state funding were decreased while our membership was increasing  our profitability would be adversely affected 
acts of terrorism could cause our business to suffer 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to predict and effectively manage medical costs 
if acts of terrorism were to occur in markets in which we operate our business could possibly suffer 
the results of terrorism acts could lead to higher than expected medical costs  network and information technology disruptions  and other related factors beyond our control 
risks related to our business receipt of inadequate premiums would negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
most of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member 
these premiums are fixed by contract  and we are obligated during the contract period to facilitate access to health care services as established by the state governments 
we have less control over costs related to the provision of health care than we do over our selling  general and administrative expenses 
historically  our expenses related to health benefits as a percentage of premium revenue have fluctuated 
for example  our expenses related to health benefits were of our premium revenue in  and of our premium revenue in if premiums are not increased and expenses related to health benefits rise  our earnings could be impacted negatively 
in addition  our actual health benefits costs may exceed our estimated costs 
the premiums we receive under our current contracts may therefore be inadequate to cover all claims  which may cause our profits to decline 
maryland sets the rates which must be paid to hospitals by all payors 
it is possible for the state to increase rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us 
if this were to occur  or if other states were to take similar actions  our profitability would be harmed 
our inability to manage medical costs effectively would reduce our profitability 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to predict and effectively manage medical costs 
changes in health care regulations and practices  level of use of health care services  hospital costs  pharmaceutical costs  major epidemics  new medical technologies and other external factors  including general economic conditions such as inflation levels  are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of health care services 
although we have been able to manage medical costs through a variety of techniques  including various payment methods to primary care physicians and other providers  advance approval for hospital services and referral requirements  medical management and quality management programs  our information systems and reinsurance arrangements  we may not be able to continue to manage costs effectively in the future 
it is possible that claims previously denied and claims previously paid to non network providers will be appealed and subsequently reprocessed at different amounts 
this would result in an adjustment to claims expense 
if our costs for medical services increase  our profits could be reduced  or we may not remain profitable 
our limited ability to predict our incurred medical expenses accurately could negatively impact our reported results 
our medical expenses include estimates of ibnr 
we estimate our ibnr medical expenses based on a number of factors  including prior claims experience  maturity of markets  complexity of products and stability of 
table of contents provider networks 
adjustments  if necessary  are made to medical expenses in the period during which the actual claim costs are ultimately determined or when criteria used to estimate ibnr change 
we utilize the services of independent actuaries who are contracted on a regular basis to calculate and review the adequacy of our medical liabilities  in addition to using our internal resources 
we cannot be sure that our ibnr estimates are adequate or that adjustments to such ibnr estimates will not harm our results of operations 
further  our inability to accurately estimate ibnr may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions  further exacerbating the extent of the harm on our results 
we maintain reinsurance to protect us against severe or catastrophic medical claims  but we cannot assure you that such reinsurance coverage will be adequate or available to us in the future or that the cost of such reinsurance will not limit our ability to obtain it 
difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 
historically  the acquisition of medicaid contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth 
although we cannot predict our rate of growth as the result of acquisitions with any accuracy  we believe that acquisitions similar in nature to those we have historically executed will be important to our growth strategy 
many of the other potential purchasers of these assets have greater financial resources than we have 
in addition  many of the sellers are interested in either selling  along with their medicaid assets  other assets in which we do not have an interest  or selling their companies  including their liabilities  as opposed to just the assets of the ongoing business 
therefore  we cannot be sure that we will be able to complete acquisitions on terms favorable to us or that we can obtain the necessary financing for these acquisitions 
we are currently evaluating proposals to acquire additional businesses 
these proposals are at various stages of consideration and we may enter into letters of intent or other agreements relating to these proposals at any time 
however  we cannot predict when or whether we will actually acquire these businesses 
we are generally required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions 
in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate  we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state 
in addition  although we may already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business  we will be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if  as a result of the acquisition  we will operate in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner  or at all 
our current credit facility imposes certain restrictions on acquisitions 
we may not be able to meet these restrictions 
in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions  we will also be required to integrate our acquisitions with our existing operations 
this may include the integration of additional employees who are not familiar with our operations  existing provider networks  which may operate on different terms than our existing networks  existing members  who may decide to switch to another health care provider  and disparate information and recordkeeping systems 
accordingly  we may be unable to successfully identify  consummate and integrate future acquisitions or operate acquired businesses profitably 
we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that incurring expenses to acquire a business will result in the acquisition being consummated 
these expenses could impact our selling  general and administrative expense 
table of contents ratio 
if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy  our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 
difficulties implementing acquired businesses could adversely affect our business effective january   we entered florida through the acquisition of php holdings  inc and its subsidiary  physicians healthcare plans  inc 
together php 
our profitability depends on our ability to integrate acquired businesses onto our technology platform and apply our operations strategy 
difficulties implementing our strategy in florida and integrating the php business could adversely affect our profitability 
failure of a new business of ours would negatively impact our results of operations 
start up costs associated with a new business can be substantial 
for example  in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions  we must first establish a provider network  have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to be able to obtain a state contract and process claims 
if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license  winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs  the new business would fail 
we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover start up costs 
the loss of the costs associated with starting up the business could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
ineffective management of our growth may negatively affect our results of operations  financial condition and business 
we have experienced rapid growth 
in  our first full year of operations  we had million of premium revenue 
in  we had  million in premium revenue 
this increase represents a compound annual growth rate of 
depending on acquisition and other opportunities  we expect to continue to grow rapidly 
continued growth could place a significant strain on our management and on other resources 
we anticipate that continued growth  if any  will require us to continue to recruit  hire  train and retain a substantial number of new and highly skilled medical  administrative  information technology  finance and other support personnel 
our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
if we continue to experience rapid growth  our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may be inadequate to support our operations  and our management may fail to anticipate adequately all demands that growth will place on our resources 
in addition  due to the initial costs incurred upon the acquisition of new businesses  rapid growth could adversely affect our short term profitability 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition could suffer 
we are subject to competition which impacts our ability to increase our penetration of the markets that we service 
we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network  benefits provided and quality of service 
we compete with numerous types of competitors  including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided 
some of the health plans with which we compete have substantially larger enrollments  greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do 
while many states mandate health plan enrollment for medicaid eligible participants  the programs are voluntary in other states  such as illinois 
subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications  the federal government requires that there be choice for medicaid recipients among managed care programs 
voluntary programs and mandated competition will impact our ability to increase our market share 

table of contents in addition  in most states in which we operate we are not allowed to market directly to potential members  and therefore  we rely on creating name brand recognition through our community based programs 
where we have only recently entered a market or compete with health plans much larger than we are  we may be at a competitive disadvantage unless and until our community based programs and other promotional activities create brand awareness 
restrictions and covenants in our new credit facility may limit our ability to take actions 
during  we entered into a credit and guaranty agreement with three banks for a million revolving credit facility 
in july  we expanded our credit facility to million by adding a fourth bank 
the credit facility is secured by the assets of amerigroup corporation and by the common stock of its wholly owned subsidiaries 
pursuant to the credit and guaranty agreement  we must meet certain financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with such covenants 
these financial covenants include meeting certain financial ratios  a limit on annual capital expenditures  and a minimum net worth requirement 
as of december   there was million outstanding under the credit facility 
events beyond our control  such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in the competitive environment  could impair our operating performance  which could affect our ability to comply with the terms of the credit facility 
breaching any of the covenants or restrictions could result in the unavailability of the facility or a default under the credit facility 
we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow will be sufficient to fully repay outstanding borrowings under the credit facility or that we would be able to restructure such indebtedness on terms favorable to us 
if we were unable to repay  refinance or restructure our indebtedness under the credit facility  the lenders could proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness 
the loss of the services of our chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer would harm our operations 
we are highly dependent on the efforts of mr 
jeffrey mcwaters  our chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer 
mr 
mcwaters  as our founder  has been instrumental in developing our mission and forging our relationships with our government client customers and the communities we serve 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain mr 
mcwaters or attract a suitable replacement or additional personnel if required 
we have an employment agreement with mr 
mcwaters which had an initial expiration of october but has been extended to october and has automatic one year renewals going forward 
pursuant to this agreement  if mr 
mcwaters were to voluntarily terminate his employment with us  he would lose his entitlement to severance benefits 
we cannot be sure that the employment agreement creates sufficient incentives for mr 
mcwaters to continue his employment with us 
while we believe that we could find a replacement for mr 
mcwaters if he were to leave  the loss of his services could harm our operations 
our inability to maintain satisfactory relationships with providers would harm our profitability 
our profitability depends  in large part  upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals  physicians and other health care providers 
our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians and specialists usually are for one to two year periods and automatically renew for successive one year terms  subject to termination by us for cause based on provider conduct or other appropriate reasons 
the contracts generally may be canceled by either party upon to days prior written notice 
our contracts with hospitals are usually for one to two year periods and automatically renew for successive one year periods  subject to termination for cause due to provider misconduct or other appropriate reasons 
generally  our hospital contracts may be canceled by either party without cause on to days prior written notice 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to renew such contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 
we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets 
although we have established long term relationships with many of our providers  we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms 
if we are unable to retain our current 
table of contents provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms  our profitability will be harmed 
on occasion  our members obtain care from providers that are not in our network and with which we do not have contracts 
to the extent that we know of such instances  we attempt to redirect their care to a network provider 
we have generally reimbursed non network providers at the rates paid to comparable network providers or at the applicable rate that the provider could have received under the traditional fee for service medicaid program  or at a discount therefrom 
in some instances  we pay non network providers pursuant to the terms of our contracts with the state 
however  some non network providers have requested that we pay them at their highest billing rate  or full billed charges 
full billed charges are significantly more than the amount the non network providers could otherwise receive under the traditional fee for service medicaid program 
additionally  some non network providers in new jersey and texas have filed lawsuits seeking reimbursements of full billed charges from us for services they provided to our members 
to the extent that non network providers are successful in obtaining payment at rates in excess of the rates that we have historically paid to non network providers  our profitability could be materially adversely affected 
we are dependent on our relationship with cook children s physician network 
any material modification or discontinuation of this relationship could harm our results of operations 
cook children s physician network is our exclusive provider network for pediatric services in fort worth  texas  where we had approximately  members as of december if the terms of our contract with cook children s were to change significantly or cook children s were to terminate its agreement with us  our costs to provide health care in this area could increase 
we could lose members if cook children s chose to associate with another hmo or if it obtained its own contract with the state to provide health care services to medicaid recipients 
negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and operating results 
recently  the managed care industry has received negative publicity 
this publicity has led to increased legislation  regulation  review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector 
these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services  require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate  further increasing the costs of doing business and adversely affecting our operating results 
we may be subject to claims relating to medical malpractice  which could cause us to incur significant expenses 
our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims 
in addition  states are beginning to adopt legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations 
claims of this nature  if successful  could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
therefore  successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us  our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability 
in addition  we may be subject to other litigation that may adversely affect our business or results of operations 
we maintain errors and omissions insurance and such other lines of coverage as we believe is reasonable in light of our experience to date 
however  this insurance may not be sufficient or available at a reasonable cost to protect us from liabilities which might adversely affect our business or results of operations 
even if any claims brought against us were unsuccessful or without merit  we would still have to defend ourselves against such claims 
any such defenses may be time consuming and costly  and may distract our management s attention 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate our business 

table of contents changes in the number of medicaid eligibles or benefits provided to medicaid eligibles as a result of state and federal budgets decreasing or not increasing  or during a period of general economic improvement  could cause our operating results to suffer 
historically  the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment  corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions 
however  during such economic downturns  state and federal budgets could decrease  causing states to attempt to cut health care programs  benefits and rates 
if this were to happen while our membership was increasing  our results of operations could suffer 
conversely  the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve  thereby causing our operating results to suffer 
our inability to integrate and manage our information systems effectively could disrupt our operations 
our operations are significantly dependent on effective information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in  among other things  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators 
our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications  claims status and other information 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
moreover  our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information systems 
we are continually upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities 
if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems  we could suffer  among other things  from operational disruptions  loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members  regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses
