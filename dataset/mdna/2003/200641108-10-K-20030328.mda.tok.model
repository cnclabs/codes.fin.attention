item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations thousands of dollars except per share data unless noted otherwise general the property and casualty insurance industry continues to remain highly competitive and inherently volatile in nature 
property and casualty insurance company results have traditionally been impacted by the typical forces unique to the industry  such as competition  frequency and severity of losses  the overall economy and the general regulatory environment in those states in which the insurer operates 
additional forces are impacting the industry in the form of deregulation  on line commerce  price competition  empowered customers and technological advancement 
according to am best co 
am best  the unprecedented events of september have forever changed the way the insurance industry defines risk 
both property and liability lines have been exposed to catastrophic risks that cannot be priced using traditional actuarial methods 
am best goes on to state  against the backdrop of weak financial trends  this new risk environment has accelerated the hardening of the us property casualty market 
given this increased risk environment  am best expects to see a renewed flight to quality that will benefit financially strong insurers 
the financial losses due to the events of september were significant to the insurance industry  however  due to the limited exposure that the commerce group  inc the company has outside of massachusetts  the direct financial impact to the company was not material 
additionally  price competition remains quite heavy in many areas of the country  although it has improved in among independent agency companies in massachusetts 
beyond massachusetts  industry underwriting results are expected to continue to deteriorate in the near future which further emphasizes the importance of competitive advantages gained by affinity marketing and efficient operations 
with these issues on the forefront  the company continues to position itself to respond to the prevailing forces and conditions in the market 
the company has utilized its strong agency relationships  a low cost structure  affinity group alliances and a joint venture acquisition all in an effort to keep the company responsive in today s competitive environment 
the company  incorporated in  is a holding company for several property and casualty insurers  and  through these insurance subsidiaries  offers predominantly private passenger motor vehicle insurance along with a broad range of other property and casualty insurance products 
these products are marketed to affinity groups  individuals  families and businesses through the company s strong relationships with professional independent insurance agencies 
the company writes insurance primarily in the commonwealth of massachusetts through the commerce insurance company commerce and citation insurance company citation  both wholly owned subsidiaries of commerce holdings  inc chi 
additionally  the company writes insurance in the states of california and oregon through commerce west insurance company commerce west  a wholly owned subsidiary of commerce  located in pleasanton  california 
the company also writes insurance through american commerce insurance company american commerce  which it acquired in january located in columbus  ohio  american commerce is a wholly owned subsidiary of acic holding co  inc  ahc with policies in states and licenses in several others 
commerce also began writing personal lines business in new hampshire in the later part of effective january   the ownership interests in ahc were recapitalized 
prior to the recapitalization at december   commerce maintained an common stock interest and aaa southern new england aaa sne maintained a common stock interest in ahc 
additionally  all ahc preferred stock was owned by commerce 
the recapitalization resulted in redeeming of all the ahc preferred stock by commerce in exchange for  additional shares of ahc common stock 
this resulted in commerce increasing its ahc common stock interest to with aaa sne maintaining a ahc common stock interest with no preferred stock outstand ing 
the recapitalization also resulted in the creation of million in minority interest for aaa sne 
fix this page break since  commerce has maintained an affinity group marketing relationship with aaa insurance agency  inc  a subsidiary of aaa sne 
aaa insurance agency  inc has been a licensed insurance agent of commerce since the company s business strategy remains focused on activities primarily related to personal automobile insurance 
the company has been the largest writer of personal property and casualty insurance in the commonwealth of massachusetts in terms of market share of direct premiums written since the company s share of the massachusetts personal automobile market increased to in  as exhibited in the table below  exceeding our two nearest competitors  which both maintained a market share

as mentioned  the company predominantly writes private passenger automobile insurance 
the following tables indicate direct premiums written for private passenger automobile  commercial automobile and homeowners 
total direct premiums written increased  or in over the increase was primarily attributable to a  or increase in massachusetts private passenger automobile direct premiums written 
this was the result of a increase in written exposures coupled with an increase of in average premiums per exposure 
private passenger premiums written for all other states increased  or  primarily attributable to an increase in american commerce premiums of  or  due primarily to book rollovers of business from existing agents  partially offset by decreases in states where the company is not actively pursuing writings coupled with an increase of  or additional premiums from commerce west

owners of registered automobiles are generally required to maintain certain minimum automobile insurance coverages 
with very limited exceptions  private passenger automobile insurers are required by law to issue a policy to any applicant seeking to obtain such coverages 
companies in massachusetts are also assigned agents  known as exclusive representative producers erps  based primarily on market share  that have been unable to obtain a voluntary contract with an insurance carrier 
marketing and underwriting strategies for companies operating in massachusetts are limited by maximum premium rates and minimum agency commission levels for personal automobile insurance  both of which are mandated by the massachusetts commissioner of insurance commissioner 
in massachusetts  accident rates  bodily injury claims  and medical care costs continue to be among the highest in the nation 
according to the automobile insurers bureau of massachusetts aib  massachusetts has higher than average medical costs and liability claims involving attorneys 
according to the aib  massachusetts personal automobile premium per policy  based on premium information  was the th highest in the nation 
during the three year period from to  average mandated massachusetts personal automobile insurance premium rates decreased an average of per year 
the commissioner approved an average increase of in personal automobile premiums for  as compared to no rate change in coinciding with the rate decision  the commissioner also approved an increase of in the commission dollar rate agents receive for selling private passenger automobile insurance in state mandated actual average state average commerce average rate year rate change rate change change per exposure estimated 
based on massachusetts division of insurance filings 
although average mandated personal automobile premium rates were unchanged in  commerce s average rate increased per exposure 
the increase for was the result of a decrease in the safe driver insurance plan sdip deviations for step drivers  the best driver sdip classification in massachusetts and the facts that the announced rate decision rate change did not include the impact of expected purchases of new automobiles in the year to which the rate decision applied  the company s mix of personal automobile business differs from that of the industry  and changes to the company s distribution of risks by class  territory and coverage 
the actual state average rate change represents the change in the average rate paid by drivers in massachusetts  as opposed to the state mandated average rate change 
as can be seen above  the commerce average rate change per exposure corresponds more closely to the actual state average rate change 
the reason for this is that both take into account newer vehicles  as compared to the state mandated average rate change which does not 
the company s performance in its personal and commercial automobile insurance lines is integrally tied to its participation in commonwealth automobile reinsurers car  a state mandated reinsurance mechanism  which permits the company and most other writers of automo bile insurance in massachusetts to reinsure any automobile risk that the insurer perceives to be under priced at the premium level permitted by the commissioner 
all companies writing automobile insurance in massachusetts share in the underwriting results of car business for their respective product line or lines 
since its inception  car has annually generated multi million dollar underwriting losses in primarily the personal pool 
the company is required to share in the underwriting results of car business for its respective product lines 
under current regulations  the company s share of the car personal or commercial deficit is based upon its market share for retained automobile risks for the particular pool  adjusted by a utilization concept  such that  in general  the company is disproportionately and adversely affected if its relative use of car reinsurance exceeds that of the industry  and favorably affected if its relative use of car reinsurance is less than that of the industry 
for personal automobile writers  companies can reduce their participation ratio by writing credit eligible business voluntarily 
companies are provided credits against their participation ratio for writing those classes and territories of business that are purposefully under priced in the massachusetts rate setting process 
the company s strategy has been to maintain above average voluntary retention levels  as well as to voluntarily retain private passenger automobile business that receives credits 
this favorably impacts the company s participation ratio compared to its market share  but also adversely impacts the company s voluntary loss ratio 
significant changes in the utilization of the car private passenger pooling mechanism are not expected under the current system 
various car participation formula changes have been fully implemented since with only minor changes since then 
the company s strategy has been to voluntarily retain more of the types of private passenger automobile business that generate credits  favorably impacting the utilization formula 
these credits primarily result from voluntarily writing business in under priced territories and for under priced risks 
as a result of increased voluntary retention in excess of the industry  the credits impacting the utilization formula have favorably affected the company s participation ratio  however  at the same time  adversely affected its voluntary loss ratio 
as indicated in the accompanying table  this ratio is several percentage points below the company s estimated share of the massachusetts personal automobile market 
the company continues to expect the marketplace to make minor annual adjustments to find the optimum balance between voluntary and ceded writings

in addition  the company receives a fee for servicing ceded policies based on the expense structure established by car 
for the years ended december   and  these servicing fees amounted to   and  respectively 
the company presents assets and liabilities gross of reinsurance 
the residual market receivable represents the gross amount of reinsurance recoverable from car including unpaid losses  unearned premiums  paid losses recoverable and unpaid ceded and assumed premiums 
the current car utilization based participation ratio has been in place for the personal automobile market since during  and the company s amount of personal automobile exposures it reinsured through car approximated for each year  as compared to industry averages of  and  respectively 
member companies of car have joint and several liabilities for the obligations of car 
if one member of car fails to pay its assessments  the remaining members of car will be required to pay the pro rata share of the member who fails to pay its obligations 
at the present time  the company is not aware of any car member company who has failed to meet its obligations 
in a letter to the massachusetts insurance commissioner the commissioner dated june   the massachusetts attorney general reported that  based on his examination of available information  he believes that the car plan for providing access to insurance in the residual market does not comply with the car enabling statute  and must be changed to produce a fair and equitable market 
the attorney general s letter describes several factors that he believes support his findings and which he believes should be corrected in order to comply with massachusetts law governing car 
the attorney general s letter calls on the commissioner to work with him to address these issues 
it is uncertain whether and to what extent the issues raised by the attorney general will be addressed by the commissioner 
we cannot be certain whether changes  if any  would have a material impact on the company 
the percentage of commercial automobile premiums ceded to car by the industry was estimated by the company to be in the percentage of commercial automobile business ceded to car by the company was approximately 
car depopulation over the last several years  coupled with car rate increases for ceded commercial business  have led to a reduction in the size of the annual commercial automobile deficits 
the company intends to continue to re spond to the profit opportunities within the market  as well as the incentives and disincentives provided by car rules  as deemed necessary and appropriate 
the company provides a separate rating tier for preferred massachusetts commercial automobile business through citation 
approximately of the company s massachusetts commercial automobile premiums produced by voluntary agents in were written in citation 
the company expects that this secondary rating tier will continue to assist the company in retaining its better commercial automobile accounts  while also further increasing the percentage of commercial automobile business that can be retained voluntarily by the company in and beyond 
commerce has actively pursued affinity group marketing programs since the primary purpose of affinity group marketing programs is to provide participating groups with a convenient means of purchasing discounted private passenger automobile insurance through associations and employer groups 
emphasis is placed on writing larger affinity groups  although accounts with as few as participants are considered 
affinity groups are eligible for rate discounts  which must be filed annually with the division of insurance 
in general  the company looks for affinity groups with mature stable membership  favorable driving records and below average turnover ratios 
participants who leave the sponsoring group during the term of the policy are allowed to maintain the policy until expiration 
at expiration  a non discounted commerce policy may be issued through the agency  at the insured s option 
since the latter part of  commerce has been a leader in affinity group marketing  through agreements with the four american automobile association clubs of massachusetts aaa clubs  offering discounts on private passenger automobile insurance to the clubs members who reside in massachusetts 
a discount was approved for policies effective january  membership in these clubs is estimated to represent approximately one third of the massachusetts motoring public  and has been the primary reason for an increase in the number of personal automobile exposures written by commerce since year end the aaa affinity group program incepted in october of

the remaining of the aaa group program was written through commerce s network of independent agents of total massachusetts automobile exposures 
massachusetts law allows two years to reach the required group penetration level of 
commerce has continued to maintain aaa member participation in excess of through december   when it was estimated at approximately 
the two year penetration requirement was waived by the massachusetts legislature for  and waiving the penetration requirements allows insurance companies to continue offering group discounts without the particular group reaching the penetration level 
commerce and the aaa clubs have agreed that commerce shall be their exclusive under writer of massachusetts personal automobile group programs 
a rolling three year contract between commerce and the aaa clubs exists  which renews automatically and may be terminated upon a minimum of three years written notice to either party

this allowed agents of berkshire the opportunity to offer commerce automobile insurance policies to their customers whose policies renewed in commerce assumed all of berkshire s obligations for future policy years beyond under car  including assignment of berkshire s involuntary agents

a sliding scale commission  based on loss ratio  is utilized under this program

effective july   the company amended its quota share reinsurance program in the event of terrorist acts 
the maximum reimbursement to the company from its quota share reinsurers will be limited to  in the event of certain defined terrorist acts

regulatory matters general although the us federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry  federal initiatives often have an impact on the business 
congress and certain federal agencies continue to investigate the current condition of the insurance industry encompassing both life and health and property and casualty insurance in the united states in order to decide whether some form of federal role in the regulation of insurance companies would be appropriate 
congress conducts hearings relating  in general  to the solvency of insurers and has proposed federal legislation from time to time on this and other subjects 
in november  the gramm leach bliley act was signed into law 
the act repealed the glass steagall act of  which had prohibited the merger of banks and securities firms  and substantially modified the bank holding company act of  which had the effect of separating banking and insurance underwriting business 
the law contains provisions that govern competition  created safe harbor protections for specific state laws  and established consumer protections that govern bank insurance sales 
the terrorism risk insurance act of was passed by congress and signed into law by president bush on november  the purpose of the act is to establish a temporary federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism 
the act defines a certified act of terrorism as an act that is certified by the secretary of the treasury as resulting in aggregate losses in excess of  is a violent act or dangerous to human life  property or infrastructure  and is committed by an individual s acting on behalf of any foreign person or interest as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the united states or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the united states government by coercion 
due to the types of coverage offered by the company and the limited exposure the company has outside of massachusetts  management believes the financial impact as a result of the act will not be material

risk based capital rbc in order to enhance the regulation of insurer insolvency  the naic developed a formula and model law to provide for rbc requirements for property and casualty insurance companies 
rbc requirements are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations 
the rbc model for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers i underwriting  which encompasses the risk of adverse loss development and inadequate pricing  ii declines in asset values arising from credit risk  and  iii other business risks from investments 
insurers having less statutory surplus than required by the rbc calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action  depending on the level of capital inadequacy 
the rbc model formula proposes four levels of regulatory action 
the extent of regulatory intervention and action increases as the percentage of surplus to rbc falls 
the first level  the company action level as defined by the naic  requires an insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the regulator if surplus falls below of the rbc amount 
the regulatory action level as defined by the naic requires an insurer to submit a plan containing corrective actions and permits the commissioner to perform an examination or other analysis and issue a corrective order if surplus falls below of the rbc amount 
the authorized control level as defined by the naic allows the regulator to rehabilitate or liquidate an insurer in addition to the aforementioned actions if surplus falls below of the rbc amount 
the fourth action level is the mandatory control level as defined by the naic  which requires the regulator to ehabilitate or liquidate the insurer if surplus falls below of the rbc amount 
the following table provides the key rbc information for the company s insurance subsidiaries  commerce  citation  commerce west  and american commerce commerce american commerce citation west commerce dollars in millions at december  statutory surplus rbc company action level statutory surplus in excess of rbc company action level rbc amounts of surplus to rbc amounts  restatement for employee stock option variable accounting treatment for employee stock options issued by the company from through  the company utilized fixed accounting treatment through september  this accounting treatment was reviewed with the company s independent auditors  ernst young llp  who concurred with the company s treatment throughout this period 
on january   a question was raised by ernst young llp as to the appropriateness of the fixed accounting treatment for some of the company s option grants 
ernst young llp advised the company that it could no longer concur with fixed accounting for the options granted to employees in and therefore  the company applied variable accounting treatment in and also retroactively to and prior years 
accordingly  the company restated its and first three quarters of results 
the impact of the restatement for the year ended resulted in a decrease to net earnings of million or per diluted share 
the year to date impact through the third quarter of resulted in an increase to net earnings of million or per diluted share

the total rate change depicted is the result of the weighted average of premiums written for all coverages divided by liability exposures only  due to the fact that all exposures are required to carry liability coverage 
the above percentage changes were primarily the result of rate modifications in the individual coverage components in the state mandated rates  changes in the company s safe driver rate deviations  and changes in the distribution of the company s business by class and territory 
the combination of these factors resulted in a increase in the average personal automobile premium per exposure in despite no change from the previous year for the state mandated average rates  the company s increase in the average personal automobile premium per exposure was primarily due to the above noted changes coupled with the fact that the announced rate decision does not include the effect of future purchases of new automobiles in the year to which the rate decision applies  and the company s mix of personal automobile business differs from that of the industry 
in  the company did not offer its customers safe driver deviations 
included in the premium increase for massachusetts personal automobile direct premiums written are premiums that were the result of appointments of new agents

direct premiums written for massachusetts homeowners insurance increased by  or due primarily to a increase in the number of massachusetts policies written coupled with a increase in the average massachusetts premium per policy

investment gains and losses net realized investment losses totaled  during as compared to  in net realized investment losses during were primarily centered in to two areas  preferred stock mutual funds and other than temporary impairments 
declines in the market values of utility common stocks held by preferred stock mutual funds were the primary reasons for losses  totaling  the company reflects these declines through realized losses because its significant level of ownership requires the use of the equity method of accounting for these funds 
the realized losses were also impacted by write downs for other than temporary declines in the market value of certain fixed maturities  preferred and common stocks totaling  a focus of management s judgments and estimates relating to investments involves the potential impairment of investments for other than temporary declines in market value 
an impairment in an investment is deemed to be other than temporary when a security s market value has diminished to less than of cost for two consecutive calendar quarters 
if the contractual terms of the security are being complied with  management performs a cash flow valuation to determine the potential impairment of the security 
if the security is deemed impaired  the company adjusts the security s cost to market value through realized loss based on publicly available information or  in the absence of such  to a value based on cash flow modeling 
gross accumulated other comprehensive losses were  and  at year end and  respectively 
these amounts represent securities whose market values were greater than  but less than  of cost 
market value declines for these securities relate primarily to interest rate changes and not to significant declines in a security s rating  financial situation or sector issues and are not considered impaired due to the company s ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity 
carrying values of investments in fixed maturities  which include taxable and non taxable bonds  and investments in common and preferred stocks  are derived from market prices supplied by the company s investment custodian 
unrealized investment gains and losses on these investments  to the extent that there is no other than temporary impairment of value  are credited or charged to a separate component of stockholders equity  known as net accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  until realized 
fair market value of fixed maturities and preferred and common stocks is based on quoted market prices 
for other investments  fair market value equals quoted market price  if available 
if a quoted market price is not available  fair market value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities 
when investment securities are sold  the realized gain or loss is determined on a specific identification basis

these investments primarily provide seed capital for start up companies with emerging high technology initiatives in the financial services industry

investments in these venture capital funds are accounted for on an equity basis 
losses and loss adjustment expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses lae incurred on a statutory basis as a percentage of insurance premiums earned loss ratio increased to in as compared to in the primary reasons for this increase were higher private passenger automobile losses from car as a result of increased participation from car and higher car loss ratios  coupled with an increase in personal automobile bodily injury claim frequency compared to last year 
another factor in the increase resulted from business written outside of massachusetts where the loss ratio for other than massachusetts business increased to during as compared to for these factors were somewhat offset by a lower physical damage claim frequency and better experience in the massachusetts commercial automobile line 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of beginning and ending reserves for losses and loss adjustment expense  net of reinsurance deductions from all reinsurers including car  as shown in the company s consolidated financial statements for the periods indicated 
years ended december  restated loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  beginning of year  prior to effect of ceded reinsurance recoverable   incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses provision for insured events of the current year   decrease in provision for insured events of prior years   total incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses   payments losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of the current year   losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of prior years   total payments   loss and loss adjustment expense reserves prior to effect of ceded reinsurance recoverable   ceded reinsurance recoverable   reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses at the end of year per financial statements   the decrease in provision for insured events of prior years represents redundancies for reserves established for prior year 
this decrease in provision was principally the result of re estimation of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses principally on the personal automobile  commercial automobile and homeowners lines of business 
the  amount for indicates that management s estimate for the year end loss reserves was within of the amount established at december  because of the inherently difficult task of estimating the amount required to ultimately settle all losses several years into the future  it is probable that actual amounts will be either higher or lower than the originally established reserves at any given point in time 
management s intent when establishing its estimate for reserves is to be within a tolerance of plus or minus five percent of the reserve required to ultimately settle all losses 
management gauges its selected reserve estimate to the ranges as determined by the company s actuaries in order to determine the reasonability of its estimate 
to the extent that management s selected reserve is within the range of the actuarial estimates  management will not adjust its estimates  instead  it will rely on its independently calculated reserve amounts 
for all of the company s insurance subsidiaries  the aggregate actuarial estimate for the loss and lae reserves  prior to the effect of ceded reinsurance recoverable  ranges from a low of million to a high of million 
the company s financial statement loss and lae reserves  based on management s best estimate  was established at million for year end management calculates its estimate independently from those amounts as calculated by the company s actuaries and  therefore  the final results are most often not the same 
management estimates its amounts primarily by reviewing historical loss and lae data  focusing mainly on payment data 
it also reviews and compares most recent loss frequency  severity and payment data to historical trends in an attempt to determine if patterns are remaining consistent or not 
management attempts to establish its reserve estimate as close to the amount required for the ultimate future payments necessary to settle all losses 
the accuracy of this estimate is reflected by the line noted above entitled decrease in provision for insured events of prior years 
policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net premiums written  underwriting expenses for the insurance companies on a statutory basis decreased to in as compared to in the improvement was primarily due to a lower mandated massachusetts personal automobile commission rate and lower general underwriting expenses 
another factor in the decrease resulted from business written outside of massachusetts where the underwriting expense ratio decreased to for as compared to for these factors were offset by higher contingent commission expenses and higher insolvency assessments 
the underwriting ratio includes a  charge versus  in  representing the company s allocation from the massachusetts insurers insolvency fund 
combined ratios the combined ratio of losses and expenses on a statutory basis was for and this resulted in an underwriting profit of for and this was the result of the factors mentioned above 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the effective tax rate was impacted by the write off of a deferred tax asset of million previously established for realized investment losses and the non deductible capital loss recognized for financial statement purposes but ineligible for tax purposes offset by tax exempt interest income and the corporate dividends received deduction 
in  the effective rate was lower than the statutory rate of primarily due to tax exempt interest income and the corporate dividends received deduction 
change in accounting principle due to the effect of a change in accounting principle related to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  the company recorded income in the first quarter of  net of taxes  of  or per share diluted 
this amount represented the remaining unamortized negative goodwill related to preferred stock mutual funds and the remaining excess of book value of subsidiary interest over cost relating to the acquisition of american commerce 
negative goodwill and the excess of book value of subsidiary interest over cost occurred in these acquisitions because the underlying value of the assets purchased exceeded the purchase price 
the subsequent recognition of income that occurred as these items were eliminated was not a taxable event but instead became part of the basis of the acquired asset 
minority interest in net loss of subsidiary effective january   the ownership interests in acic holding co  inc ahc were recapitalized 
prior to the recapitalization at december   commerce maintained an common stock interest and aaa southern new england aaa sne maintained a common stock interest in ahc 
additionally  all ahc preferred stock was owned by commerce 
the recapitalization resulted in redeeming of all the ahc preferred stock by commerce in exchange for  additional shares of ahc common stock 
this resulted in commerce increasing its ahc common stock interest to with aaa sne maintaining a ahc common stock interest  with no preferred stock outstanding 
the recapitalization also resulted in the creation of million in minority interest for aaa sne 
net earnings net earnings decreased  or to  during as compared to  in  as a result of the factors previously mentioned 
pro forma operating earnings pro forma operating earnings represent net earnings adjusted for certain items the company believes are not indicative of operating results

the  or increase in massachusetts personal automobile direct premiums written resulted primarily from increases of and in the number of massachusetts personal automobile exposures for liability and physical damage coverage  respectively  offset in by decreases in rates for the coverage types noted below 
the components of these changes from the previous year for and were as follows coverage type rate change rate change liability bodily injury personal injury protection property damage to others physical damage collision comprehensive total represents change in the company s average rate per exposure from the company s prior year average rate for massachusetts private passenger automobile premiums 
the total rate change depicted is the result of the weighted average of premiums written for all coverages divided by liability exposures only  due to the fact that all exposures are required to carry liability coverage 
the above percentage changes were primarily the result of rate modifications in the individual coverage components in the state mandated rates  offset by changes in the company s safe driver rate deviations  and changes in the distributions of the business written by the company 
the combination of these factors resulted in a decrease in the average personal automobile premium per exposure in despite the state mandated average rate decrease of  the smaller company decrease in the average personal automobile premium per exposure was primarily due to the above noted changes coupled with the fact that the announced rate decision does not estimate future purchases of new auto mobiles in the year to which the rate decision applies and the company s mix of personal automobile business differs from that of the industry 
in  the company offered its customers safe driver deviations of to drivers with sdip classifications of step and for step for step and for step in

in contrast  the company s weighted average duration can be significantly less 
at december  the company s fixed income portfolio had a weighted average duration of years versus years at december  the duration of a security is the time weighted present value of the security s expected cash flows and is used to measure a security s price sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the weighted average duration is short compared to the average stated maturity because of the relatively large percentage of gnma  fnma and municipal housing bonds in the fixed maturity portfolio 
the duration reflects industry prepayment assumptions 
the municipal housing bonds are similar in nature to gnmas in that they pay down principal during the life of the bond 
for these types of bonds  investors are compensated primarily for reinvestment risk rather than credit quality risk 
during periods of significant interest rate volatility  the underlying mortgages may prepay more quickly or more slowly than anticipated 
if the repayment of principal occurs earlier than anticipated during periods of declining interest rates  investment income may decline due to the reinvestment of these funds at the lower current market rates 
in regards to the fixed income securities  the bloomberg financial system  which was used to calculate the above duration data  utilizes optional call dates  sinking fund requirements and assumes a non static prepayment pattern in deriving these averages

the discussion of these items can be found under year ended december  compared to year ended december   herein 
the company s operating activities provided cash of  in  as compared to  in  representing an increase of  or in the primary reason for this increase is that the increase in premiums collected outpaced the increase in losses and lae paid and policy acquisition cost paid 
this often occurs in a year when a company has significant increases in business as claims paid tend to lag premiums collected 
it is anticipated that loss payments will increase at a faster pace than premiums collected next year as a result of the lag catching up 
additionally  premium finance and service fees collected increased  or primarily as the result of increased business and a service fee increase on massachusetts new and renewal business from three dollars to four dollars per installment payment  for policies with effective dates of july  and forward 
for  net cash flows from investing activities used cash of  as compared to net cash flows provided by investing activities of  in the majority of the difference was a  increase in the purchase of fixed maturities 
the company purchased shorter duration fixed maturities during the company also had a  increase in the purchase of equity securities and a decline of  in the proceeds from sale of equity securities 
these were offset by an increase of  in proceeds from maturity of fixed maturities  an increase of  in proceeds from sale of fixed maturities and a decline of  in the purchase of preferred stock mutual funds 
the increase in fixed maturities was primarily due to the purchase of fnma s  previously mentioned  offset by the calls and maturities of municipal bonds coupled with principle paydowns of gnma s 
the increase in preferred stocks was primarily the result of purchases in the utility and financial services sectors 
investing activities were funded by accumulated cash and cash provided by operating activities in and commerce purchased a  square foot building in and renovated it during expenditures in and for the land and building were  and  respectively

the company s funds are generally invested in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims without the forced sale of investments 
the carrying value at market and equity of total investments at december  was  at december   the company held cash and cash equivalents of  these funds provide sufficient liquidity for the payment of claims and other short term cash needs 
the company continues to monitor interest rates on medium and long term securities and intends to maintain its relatively high cash position until such time as the company believes medium and long term rates have appropriately firmed 
the company also relies upon dividends from its subsidiaries for its cash requirements 
every massachusetts insurance company seeking to make any dividend or other distributions to its stockholders may  within certain limitations  pay such dividends and then file a report with the commissioner 
dividends in excess of these limitations are called extraordinary dividends 
an extraordinary dividend is any dividend or other property  whose fair value together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the greater of ten percent of the insurer s surplus as regards to policyholders as of the end of the preceding year  or the net income of a non life insurance company for the preceding year 
no pro rata distribution of any class of the insurer s own securities is to be included 
no massachusetts insurance company shall pay an extraordinary dividend or other extraordinary distribution until thirty days after the commissioner has received notice of the intended distribution and has not objected 
no extraordinary dividends were paid in  or similar laws exist in california and ohio 
no extraordinary dividend was paid by american commerce in or and no dividends were paid by commerce west since its acquisition 
periodically  sales have occasionally been made from the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio to actively manage portfolio risks  including credit related concerns  to optimize tax planning and to realize gains 
this practice may continue in the future 
effective july   the company entered into a retrocessional reinsurance agreement with one of its quota share reinsurers who maintains a one third participation in the company s quota share treaty 
for a premium paid to the company  the company will indemnify the reinsurer if the reinsurer incurs a loss for a single event or occurrence over a certain threshold 
losses assumed by the reinsurer must first exceed  before a reimbursement will be made  by the company  to the reinsurer 
the company s exposure to the reinsurer under this agreement is for a maximum of  the threshold translates into a  total loss event or occurrence to the company   of which represents the reinsurers portion of the quota share treaty  before the reinsurer would receive any benefit 
also  effective july   the company amended its quota share reinsurance program in the event of terrorist acts 
the maximum reimbursement to the company from its quota share reinsurers will be limited to  in the event of certain defined terrorist acts 
the company believes its exposure to terrorist acts to be very limited based upon the types of coverage offered by the company and its exposure above the limit to be extremely remote 
the company s main area of business is in the personal lines market and it has very minimal single retained exposure in excess of  industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed to

segment information the company has four reportable segments property and casualty insurance massachusetts  property and casualty insurance other than massachusetts  real estate and commercial lending  and  corporate and other 
the company s property and casualty insurance operations are written through commerce  citation  commerce west  and american commerce and are marketed to affinity groups  individuals  families and businesses through the company s relationships with professional independent insurance agencies 
the company s real estate and commercial lending operations are a result of insurance companies having the authority to invest in mortgages 
the company s wholly owned subsidiary  bay finance company  inc  originates and services residential and commercial mortgages in massachusetts and connecticut 
the corporate and other segment represents the remainder of the company s activities  including those of the parent company 
the company evaluates performance and allocates resources based primarily on the property and casualty insurance segments  which represents over of the company s total revenue for the past three years 
the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those used in the notes to the financial statements

the company s investment objective continues to focus on maximizing after tax investment income through investing in high quality diversified investments structured to maximize after tax investment income while minimizing risk 
the company s funds are generally invested in securities with maturities intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims and meet other operating needs without the forced sale of investments 
periodically  sales have occasionally been made from the company s fixed maturity portfolio to actively manage portfolio risks  including credit related concerns  to optimize tax planning and to realize gains 
this practice may continue in the future 
in conducting investing activities  the company is subject to  and assumes  market risk 
market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact from changes in interest rates and market prices 
the level of risk assumed by the company is a function of the company s overall objectives  liquidity needs and market volatility 
the company manages its market risk by focusing on higher quality equity and fixed income investments  by periodically monitoring the credit strength of companies in which investments are made  by limiting exposure in any one investment and by monitoring the quality of the investment portfolio by taking into account credit ratings assigned by recognized rating organizations 
the company s portfolio consists of four securities in default  one corporate bond and three preferred stocks  with an aggregate cost at december  of  of the company s bonds  and were rated in either of the two highest qualities categories provided by the naic for and  respectively 
although the company has significant holdings of various closed end preferred stock mutual funds  these funds are comprised primarily of preferred and common stocks traded on national stock exchanges  thus limiting exposure to any one investment 
as part of its investing activities  the company assumes positions in fixed maturity  equity  short term and cash equivalents markets 
the company is  therefore  exposed to the impacts of interest rate changes in the market value of investments 
at december   the company s exposure to interest rate changes and equity price risk has been estimated using sensitivity analysis 
the interest rate impact is defined as the effect of a hypothetical interest rate change of plus or minus basis points on the market value of fixed maturities and preferred stocks 
the equity price risk is defined as a hypothetical change of plus or minus in the fair value of common stocks 
changes in interest rates would result in unrealized gains or losses in the market value of the fixed maturity and preferred stock portfolio due to differences between current market rates and the stated rates for these investments 
based on the results of the sensitivity analysis at december   the company s estimated market exposure for a basis point increase decrease in interest rates was calculated 
a basis point increase results in a theoretical  decrease in the market value of the fixed maturities and preferred stocks 
a basis point decrease results in a theoretical  increase in the market value of the same securities 
the equity price risk impact at december   based upon a increase in the fair value of common stocks and preferred stock mutual funds  would be an increase of  and  respectively 
based upon a decrease  common stocks and preferred stock mutual funds would decrease  and  respectively 
long term interest rates year treasury bond decreased to at december  from at december  the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions such as the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic conditions  the company cannot provide any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that management might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
recent relevant accounting developments in july  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
 effective for business combinations initiated after june   requires that all business combinations be accounted for under a single method the purchase method 
use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas no 
also clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
was effective january  effective january   in accordance with sfas no 
 the company discontinued amortizing the balance sheet item excess of book value of subsidiary interest over cost which was million and million at year end and  respectively 
the and impact of the amortization of this resulted in approximately million or per share for both years  of annual operating earnings 
additionally  the company no longer amortizes the negative goodwill resulting from the purchase of preferred stock mutual funds effective january  the amount of unamortized negative goodwill at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the and impact of the amortization of this was million and million or and per share  respectively  of earnings classified as capital gains 
both the excess of book value of subsidiary interest over cost and the negative goodwill on preferred stock mutual funds was recognized as income in the first quarter of and classified as an extraordinary item 
the per share income impact of this change was per share 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas as of december  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies  which are derived based on management s judgments and estimates  are considered critical to the preparation of the company s financial statements 
investments a focus of management s judgments and estimates relating to investments involves the potential impairment of investments for other than temporary declines in market values 
the carrying value of investments in fixed maturities  which include taxable and non taxable bonds  and investments in common and preferred stocks  are derived from market prices supplied by the company s investment custodian 
unrealized investment gains and losses on common and preferred stocks and fixed maturities  to the extent that there is no other than temporary impairment of value  are credited or charged to a separate component of stockholders equity  known as net accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until realized  net of any tax effect 
an impairment in an investment is deemed to be other than temporary  when a security s market value has diminished to less than of cost for two consecutive calendar quarters 
an impairment can also occur when a security is in default or has had a significant deterioration in its financial condition 
if the security is deemed impaired  the company adjusts the security s cost to market value through realized loss based on publicly available information or  in the absence of such  to a value based on cash flow modeling 
during  the company wrote down  in bonds  preferred and common stocks with impairment as determined by management to be other than temporary 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae unpaid losses and lae  by their nature  are inherently uncertain as to the ultimate outcome of the estimated amounts 
the liability for unpaid losses and lae represents management s best estimate of the ultimate net cost of all losses and lae incurred through the balance sheet date 
the estimate for ultimate net cost of all losses incurred through the balance sheet date includes the adjusted case estimates for losses  incurred but not reported ibnr losses  salvage and subrogation recoverable and a reserve for lae 
in arriving at its best estimate  management begins with the aggregate of individual case reserves and then makes adjustments to these amounts on a line of business basis 
these adjustments to the aggregate case reserves by line of business are made based on analysis performed by management as further described below 
the entire liability for unpaid losses and lae is also independently reviewed quarterly and annually by the company s actuarial department 
liability estimates are continually analyzed and updated  and therefore  the ultimate liability may be more or less than the current estimate 
the effects of changes in the estimates are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimates are revised 
the claim cycle begins when a claim is reported to the company and claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the company s exposure  without regard to injury causality  third party liability or potential recoveries 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding the claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss 
this estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel adjusting the claim 
during the loss adjustment period  these case basis estimates are revised as deemed necessary by the company s claims department personnel based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the claim 
in accordance with industry practice  the company also maintains reserves for estimated ibnr  salvage and subrogation recoverable and lae 
these reserves are determined on the basis of historical information and the experience of the company 
adjustments to these reserves are made periodically to take into account changes in the volume of business written  claims frequency and severity  the mix of business  claims processing and other items that can be expected to affect the company s liability for losses and lae over time 
when reviewing the liability for unpaid losses and lae  the company analyzes historical data and estimates the impact of various factors such as i payment trends  ii loss expense per exposure  iii the historical loss experience of the company and industry  iv frequency and severity trends  and  v legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  changes and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation and recession 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method  however  for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual development of reserves is affected by many factors 
by using individual estimates of reported claims adjusted for managements best estimate by line of business and a review of these results by the company s actuarial area using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  the company estimates the ultimate net liability for losses and lae 
after taking into account all relevant factors  management believes that  based on existing information  the provision for losses and lae at december  is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and claims incurred as of that date 
the ultimate liability  however  may be greater or lower than established reserves 
if the ultimate exposure is greater than or less than management s estimated liability for losses and lae  based on any of the factors noted previously  the company will incur additional expense income which may have a material impact 
for all of the company s insurance subsidiaries  the aggregate actuarial estimate for the loss and lae reserves  prior to the effect of ceded reinsurance recoverable  ranges from a low of million to a high of million 
the company s financial statement loss and lae reserves  based on management s best estimate  was established at million for year end management calculates its estimate independently from those amounts as calculated by the company s actuaries and  therefore  the final results are most often not the same 
management estimates its amounts primarily by reviewing historical loss and lae data  focusing mainly on payment data 
it also reviews and compares most recent loss frequency  severity and payment data to historical trends in an attempt to determine if patterns are remaining consistent or not 
management attempts to establish its reserve estimate as close to the amount required for the ultimate future payments necessary to settle all losses 
the accuracy of this estimate is reflected by the line noted above entitled decrease in provision for insured events of prior years 
as disclosed in part i  item legal proceedings  a purported class action lawsuit  which alleges damages as a result of the alleged inherent diminished value to vehicles that are involved in accidents  is pending against commerce 
no reserve has been established for the potential liability in connection with this case because the company is currently unable to estimate the potential exposure of this purported class action lawsuit 
however  if there were a final decision certifying that a relatively large class of the company s policyholders is entitled to recover damages based upon the inherent diminished value theory  the company may have to increase materially its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as a result 
forward looking statements this annual report and form k contains some statements that are not historical facts and are considered forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve opinions  assumptions and predictions  and no assurance can be given that the future results will be achieved since events or results may differ materially as a result of risks facing the company 
these include  but are not limited to  those risks and uncertainties in our business  some of which are beyond the control of the company  that are described in the company s forms k and q  schedules d and g  and other documents filed with the sec  including the possibility of adverse catastrophe experience and severe weather  adverse trends in claim severity or frequency  adverse state and federal regulation and legislation  changes to car s operation rules and regulations  adverse state judicial decisions  litigation risks  interest rate risk  rate making decisions for private passenger automobile policies in massachusetts  potential rate filings outside of massachusetts  adverse impacts related to consolidation activities  heightened competition  as well as the economic  market or regulatory conditions and risks associated with entry into new markets and diversification 
effects of inflation and recession the company generally is unable to recover the costs of inflation in its personal automobile insurance line since the premiums it charges are subject to state regulation 
additionally  the premium rates charged by the company for personal automobile insurance are adjusted by the commissioner only at annual intervals 
such annual adjustments in premium rates may lag behind related cost increases 
economic recessions can have an impact upon the company  primarily through the policyholder s election to decrease non compulsory coverages afforded by the policy and decreased driving  each of which tends to decrease claims 
to the extent inflation and economic recession influence yields on investments  the company is also affected 
as each of these environments affect current market rates of return  previously committed investments may rise or decline in value depending on the type and maturity of investment 
inflation and recession must also be considered by the company in the creation and review of loss and lae reserves since portions of these reserves are expected to be paid over extended periods of time 
the anticipated effect of economic conditions is implicitly considered when estimating liabilities for losses and lae 
the importance of continually adjusting reserves is even more pronounced in periods of changing economic circumstances
