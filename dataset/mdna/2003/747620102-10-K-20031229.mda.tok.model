requires that the company disclose certain information about its operating segments where operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
the vehicular products segment is comprised of macsteel  piper impact and temroc 
the segment s main driver is north american light vehicle builds and to a lesser extent  heavy duty truck builds 
the building products segment is comprised of engineered products and nichols aluminum 
the main drivers of this segment are residential housing starts and remodeling expenditures 
the following table sets forth selected operating data for the company s two business segments years ended october  in thousands vehicular products net sales    operating income    depreciation and amortization    identifiable assets    building products net sales    operating income    depreciation and amortization    identifiable assets    fiscal  and results include temroc operations  acquired november  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal and results include colonial craft operations  acquired february  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
within the vehicular products segment automotive builds continued to drive demand  exceeding million annualized units for fiscal while the pace was not record setting  macsteel s capacity utilization rates were higher than experienced in fiscal macsteel s strongest market presence is with the big automakers  where builds were down for fiscal macsteel continues to work with the new american manufacturers nams  or non big automakers  on domestic part sourcing and the company s business with them is growing 
qualification efforts with the nams require time consuming evaluation periods 
beginning in august  the company has signed various agreements with sanyo special steel company  ltd  covering technology exchanges in the production of free machining lead free steels  advanced production methods and the sharing of manufacturing competencies 
these collaborative efforts are intended to position macsteel to more effectively compete among the nams 
at piper impact  sales were down for fiscal compared to the previous fiscal year  with the largest drop in business coming from a reduction in airbag component sales 
while recognizing this erosion in demand for aluminum and steel airbag components  piper impact has developed new outlets for its capacity  and has experienced significant growth in the high pressure cylinder markets 
however  this growth has not been fast enough to replace airbag component sales 
piper impact continues to lose money on many of its traditional product lines 
within the building products segment residential housing starts and remodeling expenditures remained brisk  allowing engineered products and nichols aluminum to post a combined increase in net sales over the prior fiscal year 
however  the segment s operating income declined by for fiscal  primarily as a result of increased aluminum scrap prices absorbed by nichols aluminum 
the company continues to see strong demand for its door and window components 
housing starts for the month of october were nearly million units  on a seasonally adjusted annual basis 
with demand for new residential homes at record levels  we expect customer activity to remain at high levels dampened only by inclement winter weather conditions in the northeast and midwest regions of the united states 
outlook operating results for the company s vehicular products segment are tied to north american light vehicle builds and heavy duty truck builds 
for calendar  the company expects light vehicle builds to be at or slightly above the level 
a concern to the company continues to be the loss of market share by the big to the nams 
while macsteel sells steel bar products to the nams and continues to make inroads with them  macsteel remains closely linked to the big 
heavy duty truck builds  which have been at cyclical lows for several years  are expected to recover in calendar with builds expected to top  units  up from the  units estimated to be built in operating results for the company s building products segment are tied to us housing starts and remodeling activity 
for calendar  the company expects housing starts to drop about from s very strong level 
quanex expects remodeling expenditures to remain at robust levels for calendar the company s primary raw materials are steel and aluminum scrap  which supplies our macsteel and nichols aluminum businesses 
throughout fiscal  steel scrap prices rose approximately and aluminum scrap prices rose approximately 
the company expects higher scrap prices at least through the first half of fiscal over time  macsteel recovers the majority of these cost increases through the use of scrap surcharges  but it does experience quarterly margin compression as the surcharge is based on a three month trailing index 
nichols aluminum has no such surcharge and it attempts to cover rising scrap costs through a higher selling price 
quanex s first fiscal quarter november  december and january is historically the company s least profitable as there are fewer production days due to the holidays  customer managed year end inventories and reduced building activity during the winter 
the company expects fiscal first quarter volumes at macsteel to be essentially flat to the year ago quarter  but operating income is expected to be down as they absorb last quarter s sharp increase in scrap costs 
operating income at engineered products is expected to be down compared to their excellent year ago results 
volume at nichols aluminum is expected to be up somewhat from a year ago  however  operating income is expected to be flat as they continue to absorb higher raw material costs in the absence of sales price relief 
taken together  quanex expects its first quarter diluted earnings per share to be lower compared to the same period a year ago 
the company s outlook is based on same store sales and excludes any potential benefits that may accrue from its acquisitions of the north star steel monroe facility and truseal technologies 
although the company expects minimal contributions to earnings from pending acquisitions in its first quarter  quanex does expect a considerable earnings contribution for the full year 
compared to net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal were  million representing an increase of million  or  when compared to consolidated net sales for fiscal both the vehicular and building products segments experienced increased net sales 
net sales from the company s vehicular products segment for fiscal were million representing an increase of million  or  when compared to the prior year due to increases at macsteel  offset somewhat by lower net sales at both piper and temroc 
macsteel s net sales increase was due to a increase in prices and a increase in shipments 
piper experienced lower net sales as aluminum airbag component sales declined from its prior year levels 
this decline was only partially offset by sales of new products  however  growth from new products has not been fast enough to replace airbag component sales 
net sales from the company s building products segment for fiscal were million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal engineered products net sales increase was due primarily to three additional months of sales from colonial craft which was acquired in february excluding colonial craft  combined net sales for the other engineered products business units were down slightly versus prior year due to the harsh winter weather in the first half of nichols aluminum s net sales increased from the prior year  primarily due to slightly higher average selling prices 
operating income consolidated operating income for fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or  when compared to last year 
both the vehicular and building products segments experienced decreased operating income 
operating income from the company s vehicular products segment for fiscal was million  representing a decrease of million  or  when compared to last year 
this decrease was due to lower operating income at macsteel  piper and temroc compared to the prior year s results 
although macsteel experienced higher net sales and improved conversion costs  they were more than offset by the impact of approximately higher scrap steel prices 
piper and temroc had lower operating income for the periods due largely to lower net sales 
depreciation expense for the vehicular products segment was higher with the completion of macsteel capital projects 
operating income from the company s building products segment for fiscal year was million  representing a decrease of million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this decrease was a result of lower operating income at nichols aluminum partially offset by improved results at engineered products 
engineered products benefited from a full year s results for colonial craft which was acquired in february  partially offset by lower sales volumes due to harsh winter weather in the first half of the lower results for nichols aluminum were due to higher aluminum scrap  energy and outside processing costs and production and quality problems at the alabama facility  which more than offset the higher volumes and prices 
corporate level operating expenses for fiscal increased approximately million primarily as a result of a million lifo inventory reserve adjustment 
corporate and other expenses are reported outside of the two operating segments 
included in corporate and other are the consolidated lifo inventory reserve adjustments  corporate office expenses and inter segment eliminations 
selling  general and administrative expense was million for fiscal  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to last year 
the increase results primarily from including a full year s results from colonial craft which was acquired in february depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
most of the increase came from the vehicular products segment due largely to recently completed capital projects at macsteel 
interest expense for fiscal was million compared to million last year 
the decrease in interest expense is due to a lower bank revolver balances  b conversion of the convertible subordinated debentures to company stock in june of  c redemption of subordinated debentures  and d the company paying down principal on other interest bearing debt and notes 
another factor that contributed to the decrease in interest expense was the interest rate swap agreement which was terminated on july  with the execution of the bank agreement in november see debt structure and activity below  the interest rate swaps no longer qualified as a hedge 
as a result  the company discontinued hedge accounting under sfas no 
on the swaps after the effective date of the bank agreement and reclassified the related portion of other comprehensive income to interest expense in the fiscal quarter ended october  in fiscal  losses related to the swap agreement were reclassified out of other comprehensive income into interest expense as interest payments were made 
this reclassification did not impact fiscal capitalized interest was zero for fiscal compared to million for the capitalized interest in was due to the long term capital expansion programs that were underway at macsteel 
these capital projects have been completed and the capitalization of interest ceased after the third fiscal quarter of interest capitalization for the ongoing phase vii at macsteel is expected to be insignificant 
other  net increased million from fiscal fiscal included a loss of million associated with early extinguishment of debt as a result of the redemption of the company s subordinated debentures in june also included in other  net is investment income and the amortization of debt issuance costs 
net income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal in addition to the factors mentioned above  fiscal and included a non taxable million and million benefit from retired executive life insurance claims  respectively 
compared to net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal were million representing an increase of million  or  when compared to consolidated net sales for fiscal both the vehicular and building products segments experienced increased net sales 
net sales from the company s vehicular products segment for fiscal were million representing an increase of million  or  when compared to the prior year due to increases at macsteel  offset somewhat by lower net sales at both piper and temroc 
macsteel s net sales increase was due largely to a increase in volume  which more than offset lower selling prices compared to the fiscal over half of macsteel s business is based on fixed contracts  so their ability to change pricing was limited on a near term basis 
piper experienced lower net sales as aluminum airbag component sales declined from its prior year levels 
this decline was only partially offset by sales of new products  as meaningful sales volumes of these products have been slower to materialize than expected 
net sales from the company s building products segment for fiscal were million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal engineered products net sales increases were due largely to the acquisition of colonial craft in february 
nichols aluminum s net sales also increased from the prior year due to increased volume resulting from continuing strength in the building construction markets  despite lower selling prices 
operating income consolidated operating income for fiscal was million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to both the vehicular and building products segments experienced increased operating income 
operating income from the company s vehicular products segment for fiscal was million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to this increase was due to higher operating income at macsteel compared to the prior year s results  partially offset by lower operating income at piper and temroc 
the higher net sales volume combined with productivity gains and lower conversion costs at macsteel more than offset the impact of lower spreads between selling prices and scrap prices 
piper and temroc had lower operating income for the periods due largely to lower net sales and volume 
depreciation expense for the vehicular products segment was higher with the completion of macsteel capital projects 
also contributing to the improvement in the vehicular products segment is the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective the beginning of fiscal the vehicular products segment had goodwill amortization of approximately thousand in the prior year ended october  operating income from the company s building products segment for fiscal year was million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this increase was a result of record operating income at engineered products  as well as improved results at nichols aluminum 
engineered products benefited from the acquisition of colonial craft in february  however it achieved record operating income levels without colonial craft s contribution due largely to strong demand for its products  productivity improvements and new product development and cost reduction efforts 
nichols aluminum also had increased operating income 
this increase was largely a result of increased volume and cost reduction initiatives  as well as a million business interruption insurance recovery collected during the year 
although spreads between selling price and raw material costs improved during the second half of the year  as compared to the same prior year period  for the year ended october   margins were lower as scrap prices rose more quickly than nichol s ability to raise selling prices 
also contributing to the improvement in the building products segment is the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective the beginning of fiscal the building products segment had goodwill amortization of approximately million in the prior year ending october  corporate level operating expenses for fiscal decreased approximately million versus corporate and other expenses are reported outside of the two operating segments see note to the consolidated financial statements 
included in corporate and other are the consolidated inventory lifo adjustments  corporate office expenses and inter segment eliminations 
selling  general and administrative expense was million for fiscal  representing an increase of thousand  less than  when compared to the prior year 
this increase results primarily from the acquisition of colonial in february depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense excluding goodwill amortization increased million in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
most of the increase came from the vehicular products segment due largely to recently completed capital projects at macsteel 
effective november   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized 
accordingly  goodwill amortization  on a consolidated basis  was zero for and million for the year ended october  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
interest expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was due largely to the company s outstanding debt balance substantially decreasing year over year as the convertible subordinated debentures were converted to company stock or redeemed in june of and the company paid down its bank revolver and other interest bearing debt and notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
another factor affecting interest expense was the discontinuance of hedge accounting under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities for the interest swap agreements 
based on future cash flow projections that were prepared during the second fiscal quarter ended april   it was determined there was a high likelihood the company would pay down its variable rate debt under the bank agreement revolver to approximately million by the end of fiscal based on these projections  a portion of the future projected cash flow being hedged interest payments would not occur 
therefore  during the period ended april   the company discontinued hedge accounting under sfas for million of the interest swap agreement and reclassified the related portion of other comprehensive income  a loss of million  to interest expense 
additionally  during the fourth fiscal quarter ended october   the timing of the finalization of the new bank agreement was determined 
since the swaps were designated as hedges of the bank agreement revolver  which was expected to terminate upon completion of the new bank agreement  the swap no longer qualified as a hedge  as those specific forecasted transactions would not occur future interest payments 
as a result  the company discontinued hedge accounting under sfas no 
on the swaps based on the projected new bank agreement date and reclassified the related portion of other comprehensive income  a loss of million  to interest expense 
the company terminated the million swap agreement on july  and therefore no longer reflected it on the balance sheet effective after this date 
capitalized interest increased thousand for fiscal compared to the entire amount of capitalized interest was due to the long term capital expansion programs that were underway at macsteel 
these capital projects have been completed and the capitalization of interest ceased after the third fiscal quarter of other  net decreased thousand from fiscal to as a result of the redemption of the subordinated debentures  a loss of thousand was recognized during fiscal due to the early extinguishment of debt 
this loss resulted from the write off of the remaining debt issuance costs associated with the subordinated debentures  as well as the 
premium paid on the million of debentures which were redeemed 
fiscal included a thousand gain on the early extinguishment of debt 
in accordance with sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which was adopted by the company in the period ended july   these early extinguishment of debt items were classified as ordinary instead of extraordinary items  net of tax 
also included in other  net was investment income and the amortization of debt issuance costs 
net income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal in addition to the factors mentioned above  fiscal included a non taxable million retired executive life insurance benefit which did not occur in liquidity and capital resources sources of funds the company s principal sources of funds are cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under its secured million revolving credit agreement bank agreement 
at october   the company had million borrowed under the bank agreement 
this represents a million decrease from october  borrowing levels 
the company believes that it has sufficient funds and adequate financial sources available to meet its anticipated liquidity needs 
the company also believes that cash flow from operations  cash balances and available borrowings will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to finance anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  environmental expenditures  dividends and the stock purchase program 
on december   subsequent to the fiscal year end  quanex executed an agreement with our credit facility banks to increase the bank agreement revolver to million to provide funds necessary for the north star and truseal acquisitions 
assuming we close these acquisitions as scheduled  we expect our debt level to be between million and million at the end of our fiscal quarter ended january  the company s working capital was million at october  compared to million at october  the decrease in working capital resulted from a an million decrease in inventory across both segments as a result of a company wide focus on inventory reduction  b a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  c a reduction of million related to deferred taxes and taxes payable  offset by d an increase in accounts receivable of million and e a net increase of million in other working capital balances 
changes in other working capital balances were due to timing of payments and other obligations 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities during the year ended october  was million compared to million for the same period of this increase is due to a lower working capital requirements compared to the same prior year period as discussed above  b reduced pension contributions and tax payments  partially offset by c lower operating income 
investment activities net cash used for investment activities during the year ended october  was million compared to million for the same period of investment activities for the year ended october  included the acquisition of colonial craft for million 
additionally  capital expenditures decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decline was largely due to reduced spending at macsteel  partially offset by increased spending at nichols aluminum and engineered products 
the company estimates that fiscal capital expenditures will be approximately million 
at october   the company had commitments of approximately million for the purchase or construction of capital assets 
the company plans to fund these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
cash used for investment activities detailed above was offset by cash provided for investment activities including a the receipt of million and million in retired executive life insurance proceeds for fiscal and respectively  and b the receipt of million in proceeds from the sale of piper utah in fiscal financing activities net cash used for financing activities for the year ended october  was million compared to million during the prior year

on february   the board of directors of the company increased the annual dividend from to per common share outstanding 
this increase was effective with the company s first quarter dividend paid on march  to shareholders of record on march  this increased cash used for financing activities by million for debt structure and activity current bank agreement revolver in november  the company entered into a secured million revolving credit agreement bank agreement 
the bank agreement is secured by all company assets  excluding land and buildings 
this bank agreement expires november and provides for up to million for standby letters of credit  limited to the undrawn amount available under the new bank agreement 
all borrowings under this bank agreement bear interest  at the option of the company  at either a the prime rate or federal funds rate plus one percent  whichever is higher  or b a eurodollar based rate 
the bank agreement requires facility fees  which are not significant  maintenance of certain financial ratios and maintenance of a minimum consolidated tangible net worth 
as of october   the company was in compliance with all bank agreement covenants 
the bank agreement was amended on december   to increase this line to million 
previous bank agreement revolver in july  the company entered into an unsecured million revolving credit and term loan agreement bank agreement 
at october  and  this bank agreement consisted of a revolving line of credit revolver under which the company had and million  respectively  in borrowings 
this bank agreement was replaced with a new bank agreement which is described above 
the intent and ability to refinance the outstanding balance on this bank agreement on a long term basis was evidenced by the signing of the new bank agreement in november therefore  the outstanding balance under the old bank agreement revolver was classified as non current as of october  convertible subordinated debentures the company accepted unsolicited block offers to buy back and million principal amount of the convertible subordinated debentures for and million in cash during the years ended october  and  respectively

critical accounting policies the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty 
estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information becomes available and as the company s operating environment changes 
actual results could differ from estimates 
the company believes the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements as well as the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes revenue when the products are shipped and the title and risk of ownership pass to the customer 
selling prices are fixed based on purchase orders or contractual agreements 
inherent in the company s revenue recognition policy is the determination of collectibility 
this requires management to make frequent judgments and estimates in order to determine appropriate amount of allowance needed for doubtful accounts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated to cover the risk of loss related to accounts receivable 
this allowance is maintained at a level the company considers appropriate based on historical and other factors that affect collectibility 
these factors include historical trends of write offs  recoveries and credit losses  the careful monitoring of portfolio credit quality  and projected economic and market conditions 
different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in changes to the allowance 
inventory the company records inventory valued at the lower of cost or market value 
inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the company s forecast of future demand and market conditions 
significant unanticipated changes to the company s forecasts could require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory 
risk management and derivative instruments the company s current risk management strategies include the use of derivative instruments to reduce certain risks 
the critical strategies include the use of commodity futures and options to fix the price of a portion of anticipated future purchases of certain raw materials and energy to offset the effect of fluctuations in the costs of those commodities  and the use of interest rate swaps to fix the rate of interest on a portion of floating rate debt 
these hedges have been designated as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of gains and losses is recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity in accordance with sfas no 
the company evaluates all derivative instruments each quarter to determine if they are highly effective 
any ineffectiveness as defined by sfas no 
is recorded in the statement of income 
if the anticipated future transactions are no longer expected to occur  the unrealized gains and losses on the related hedge are reclassified to the consolidated statement of income 
see note to the financial statements for further explanation 
long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  and other assets  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment and further reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may be impaired 
the carrying values are compared with the fair value of such assets calculated based on the anticipated future cash flows related to those assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which such review is performed 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and future market conditions 
future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
income taxes the company records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in the company s consolidated balance sheet  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the carrying value of the net deferred tax liability reflects the company s assumption that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize its deferred tax assets 
if the estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets 
this could result in additional income tax expense in a future period in the consolidated statement of income 
retirement and pension plans the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded postretirement plan that provides health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events  including expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 
the discount rate  which is determined using a model that matches corporate bond securities  is applied against the projected pension and postretirement disbursements 
actual pension plan asset investment performance will either reduce or increase unamortized pension losses at the end of any fiscal year  which ultimately affects future pension costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of the company and its subsidiaries exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the company 
nevertheless  because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates  foreign currency rates and metal commodity prices as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
for a description of the company s significant accounting policies associated with these activities  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company and its subsidiaries have a bank agreement  interest rate swap agreements and other long term debt which subject the company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
at october  and  the company had fixed rate debt totaling million and million  respectively 
this debt is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose the company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries floating rate obligations total million and million at october  and  respectively 
for  the company had million of swap agreements in place to limit the exposure of this obligation to increases in short term interest rates 
these swap agreements effectively fixed the interest rate  thus limiting the potential impact that increasing interest rates would have on earnings 
under these swap agreements  payments were made based on a fixed rate million at  and million at and received on a libor based variable rate at october  
at october   the fair market value related to the interest rate swap agreements was a loss of million 
to the extent that floating rate obligations are in excess of or less than million  the company was subject to changes in the underlying interest rates 
for the year ended october   the company s floating rate obligations were million less than the million swap agreement 
increases or decreases in the underlying interest rate of the swap agreement would have a direct impact on interest expense for this differential in balances 
for the year ended october   the company s floating rate obligations exceeded the amount covered by the swap agreements by million 
increases or decreases in the underlying interest rates of the obligations would have had a direct impact on interest expense for those uncovered balances 
these swap agreements expired on july  and the final settlement payment was made 
the company has not entered into any other interest swap agreements and as such is subject to the variability of interest rates on its variable rate debt 
commodity price risk the company s aluminum mill sheet products segment  nichols aluminum  uses various grades of aluminum scrap as well as prime aluminum ingot as a raw material for its manufacturing process 
the price of this aluminum raw material is subject to fluctuations due to many factors in the aluminum market 
in the normal course of business  nichols aluminum enters into firm price sales commitments with its customers 
in an effort to reduce the risk of fluctuating raw material prices  the company enters into firm price raw material purchase commitments as well as forward contracts on the london metal exchange lme 
the company s risk management policy as it relates to these lme contracts is to enter into contracts to cover the raw material needs of the company s committed sales orders  net of fixed price purchase commitments 
with the use of firm price raw material purchase commitments and lme contracts  the company aims to protect the gross margins from the effects of changing prices of aluminum 
to the extent that the raw material costs factored into the firm price sales commitments are matched with firm price raw material purchase commitments  changes in aluminum prices should have no effect on the company 
where firm price sales commitments are matched with lme contracts  the company is subject to the ineffectiveness of lme contracts to perfectly hedge raw material prices 
at october   the company had open futures contracts for aluminum pounds with a fair value of million 
the contracts had fair value losses of million at october  and covered a notional volume of million pounds of aluminum 
a hypothetical change from the october  average london metal exchange lme ingot price on open contracts of 
per pound would increase or decrease the unrealized pretax gains losses related to these contracts by approximately million 
however  it should be noted that any change in the value of these contracts  real or hypothetical  would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the cost of purchased aluminum scrap 
during the years ended october  and  nichols aluminum primarily used firm price raw material purchase commitments instead of lme forward contracts to lock in raw material prices 
at october   the company had no open lme forward contracts and therefore no asset or liability associated with metal exchange derivatives 
at october   there were two lme forward contracts associated with metal exchange derivatives covering notional volumes of million pounds with a fair value net loss of approximately thousand  which was recorded as part of other current assets and other current liabilities in the financial statements
