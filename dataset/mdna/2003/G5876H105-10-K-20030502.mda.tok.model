item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global semiconductor provider of complete broadband communications and storage solutions 
the company s diverse product portfolio includes switching  transceiver  wireless pc connectivity  gateways  communications controller  and storage solutions that power the entire communications infrastructure  including enterprise  metro  home  and storage networking 
we were founded in we are a fabless integrated circuit company  which means that we rely on independent  third party contractors to perform manufacturing  assembly and test functions 
this approach allows us to focus on designing  developing and marketing our products and significantly reduces the amount of capital we need to invest in manufacturing products 
in january  we acquired galileo technology ltd 
now marvell semiconductor israel ltd  or msil in a stock for stock transaction for aggregate consideration of approximately billion 
msil developed high performance internetworking and switching products for the broadband communications market 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the operating results of msil have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in the communications market  we offer transceiver products  switching products  internetworking products and wireless local area network products 
our primary customers for our communications products are manufacturers of high speed networking equipment 
in the storage market  our products include read channel devices  socs and preamplifiers 
our customers for our storage products are manufacturers of hard disk drives for the enterprise  desktop and mobile computer markets and the emerging consumer applications market 
the storage market is highly competitive and is dominated by a small number of large companies 
these companies have historically experienced marginal profit levels from sales of their storage products and are under enormous pricing pressure from their customers  which they typically pass through to their integrated circuit suppliers 
historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to five significant customers  each of whom individually accounted for or more of our net revenue during this period 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to four significant customers  and in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to three significant customers 
we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods 
in addition  a significant portion of our sales are made to customers located outside of the united states  primarily in asia 
sales to customers in asia represented approximately  and of our net revenue for the years ended january   and  respectively 
because many manufacturers and manufacturing subcontractors of communications and storage devices are located in asia  we expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be represented by sales to customers in that region 
substantially  all of our sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars 
our sales have historically been made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is long  which may cause us to experience a delay between the time we incur expenses and the time revenue is generated from these expenditures 
we expect to increase our research and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenditures as we seek to 
table of contents expand our operations 
we anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
consequently  if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and future quarters may be adversely affected 
our fiscal year is the or week period ending on the saturday closest to january in a week year  each fiscal quarter consists of weeks 
the additional week in a week year is added to the fourth quarter  making such quarter consist of weeks 
fiscal year was comprised of weeks 
fiscal year was comprised of weeks  and fiscal year was comprised of weeks 
for presentation purposes  our financial statements and notes and this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to january as our year end 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
under these criteria  product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product to customers  net of accruals for estimated sales returns and allowances 
however  some of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for price protection and rights of return on product unsold by the distributors 
product revenue on sales made through distributors with rights of return is deferred until the distributors sell the product to end customers 
additionally  collection is not deemed to be reasonably assured if customers receive extended payment terms 
as a result  revenue on sales to customers with payment terms substantially greater than our normal payment terms is deferred and is recognized as revenue as the payments become due 
at january   revenue of million with an associated gross profit of million was deferred 
at january   revenue of million with an associated gross profit of million was deferred 
our provision for estimated price protection  sales returns and allowances on product sales is recorded in the same period the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if actual price protection granted to distributors or product returns exceeds our estimates  additional reductions of revenue would result 
our total allowance for sales returns was million and million as of january  and  respectively 
actual future returns could be different than the returns allowance established 
we also enter into development agreements with some of our customers 
development revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method  with the associated costs included in research and development expense 
we estimate the percentage of completion of our development contracts based on an analysis of progress toward completion  which is measured using input measures such as the percentage of completion 
accounting for income taxes 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets as of january   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
to estimate our tax provision  we consider our taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we enjoy tax holidays in bermuda  singapore and israel  which expire at various dates and which are subject to our compliance with various terms and conditions set by the local tax authorities 
in the united states  we pay income tax on the income of our us subsidiary  marvell semiconductor  inc  and may be subject to the us income tax and on any income that is considered to be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states 
the determination of whether the income of a foreign corporation is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states requires significant management judgment  as it involves a consideration of all the facts and circumstances and the application of legal standards that are uncertain 
our position is that our foreign business operations do not generate any income that is effectively connected with a united states trade or business 
we recorded a tax provision of million in the year ended january  in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to record additional income tax expense or establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
accounts receivable reserves 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the realization of our accounts receivable and our results of operations 
inventory reserves 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
we are also required to perform annual assessments of goodwill impairment 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes 
table of contents in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  iii significant negative industry or economic trends  iv a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and v a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and before interest from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset 
the amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured as the difference between net book values of the asset and its estimated fair value 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires  among other things  a goodwill impairment test within six months of adoption and annual impairment tests thereafter 
we adopted sfas in february as required by sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill of billion beginning february  and have reclassified the carrying value at january  of the acquired workforce of million into goodwill because this intangible asset did not arise from contractual or other legal rights and cannot be separated from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
in january  we decided to no longer use the galileo trade name in selling and marketing activities going forward and changed the name of our israel subsidiary from galileo technology ltd 
to marvell semiconductor israel ltd 
as a result  we wrote off the remaining million net book value of the trade name in the fourth quarter of fiscal the impairment test required upon adoption of sfas and annual impairment review were completed and did not identify any impairment of goodwill 
we plan to perform an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each year  beginning in fiscal  or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
facilities consolidation charge 
during fiscal  we recorded a total of million of charges associated with costs of consolidation our facilities 
these charges included million in lease abandonment charges relating to the consolidation of our facilities in the silicon valley into one location 
the lease abandonment charge includes the remaining lease commitments of these facilities reduced by the estimated sublease income throughout the duration of the lease term 
the facilities consolidation charge also includes million consisting of the write down of certain property and leasehold improvements associated with the abandoned facilities 
additionally  we incurred charges of million through april  as a result of duplicate lease and other costs associated with the dual occupation of its current and abandoned facilities 
we are currently attempting to secure subtenants for the remainder of our lease terms for these facilities and estimate that we will have subleases in place by the fourth quarter of fiscal the facilities consolidation charge is an estimate as of january  and may change as we obtain subleases for the abandoned facilities and sublease income is known 
should there be further changes in the real estimate market conditions or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the remaining vacant facilities  adjustments to the facilities consolidation charge may be necessary in future periods based upon then current actual events and circumstances 
litigation costs 
from time to time  we are involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
there can be no assurance these actions or other third party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows or without requiring royalty payments in the future which may adversely impact gross margins 
we are aggressively defending these litigation matters and believe no material adverse outcome will result 
however  given uncertainties associated with any litigation  if our assessments prove to be wrong  or if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
valuation of equity investments 
we hold minority interests in companies 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the recorded value of our equity investments at january  is million 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
years ended january  net revenue operating costs and expenses cost of goods sold research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of stock based compensation amortization and write off of goodwill and acquired intangible assets acquired in process research and development facilities consolidation charge total operating costs and expenses operating income loss interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss years ended january  and net revenue 
net revenue consists primarily of product revenue from sales of our semiconductor devices  and to a much lesser extent  development revenue derived from development contracts with our customers 
net revenue is gross revenue  net of accruals for estimated sales returns and allowances 
net revenue was million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  the increases in net revenue reflect a significant increase in volume shipments of our storage and gigabit ethernet products during the year ended january   primarily due to increased acceptance of our soc storage products which began shipping in volume in the second half of fiscal and continued adoption of the gigabit ethernet products as a replacement for fast ethernet products 
revenue from storage products was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenue from communications products was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenue derived from development contracts increased in fiscal  but represented less than of net revenues for each year and decreased as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal we expect that revenue from storage products for fiscal will increase from the level of revenue from storage products we reported in fiscal due to increases in shipments and volume production of our storage socs  which have been widely adopted by the mobile computer sector and which we expect to be adopted by the desktop computer sector during this fiscal year  and production volume shipments of new desktop design wins 
in addition  we expect growth in revenue from communications products in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increases in shipments of our gigabit ethernet products  which we expect will continue to be adopted as the replacement for fast ethernet products  as well as new revenue opportunities for our wlan products 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing  assembly and test of integrated circuit devices and related overhead costs  and compensation and associated costs relating to manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance personnel 
gross margin  which is calculated as net 
table of contents revenue less cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net revenue  decreased to in the year ended january  from in the year ended january  the decrease in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a product mix change which included production ramps of large volume  lower margin desktop computer products in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  higher period costs related to increased inventory reserves of million for older  slower moving products contributed to a decrease in gross margins in fiscal compared to fiscal our gross margins are primarily driven by product mix  however  our margins may fluctuate in future periods due to  among other things  changes in the mix of products sold  increased pricing pressures from our customers and competitors  and changes in the amount of development revenue recognized 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to development personnel  prototype costs  depreciation and amortization expense  and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
research and development expense was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  the increase in research and development expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the hiring of additional development personnel and personnel related to our acquisition of syskonnect  which resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million  increased costs of million for prototype and related product tape out costs arising from an increase in new product initiatives at more costly lower process geometries  increased depreciation  amortization and software maintenance expense of million arising from purchases of property  equipment  technology licenses and computer aided design software  and other allocated expenses of million related to our expanding operations 
we expect that research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we develop new products  migrate to lower process geometries  expand into new markets and technologies  and hire additional personnel 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  promotional and other marketing expenses  and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
selling and marketing expense was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  the increase in selling and marketing expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel and personnel related to our acquisition of syskonnect  which resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million  increased other costs of million related to expanding our sales and marketing activities as we broaden our customer and product base  and increased facility and other allocated expenses of million related to our expanding operations  partially offset by a reduction in commission expense of million 
the reduction in commission expense was due to the transition of all of our storage customers to a direct selling basis as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal instead of using outside sales representatives 
we expect that selling and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel and expand our sales and marketing efforts into emerging product markets such as consumer applications 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to general and administrative personnel  fees for professional services and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
general and administrative expense was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  the increase in general and administrative expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the hiring of additional administrative personnel which resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million and other professional fees of million due to our expanding operations and attorney fees associated with our on going legal proceedings 
we expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods due to increased professional fees and additional personnel to support expansion of our operations through growth and acquisitions 
amortization of stock based compensation 
we have recorded deferred stock based compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to our employees and directors prior to our initial public offering of 
table of contents common stock  in connection with the assumption of stock options as a result of our acquisition of msil  and in connection with the grant of stock options as a result of our acquisition of syskonnect 
deferred stock based compensation is being amortized using an accelerated method over the remaining option vesting period 
amortization of stock based compensation was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  the decrease in amortization expense in both absolute dollars and percentage of net revenue of fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from a reduced balance of deferred stock based compensation being amortized in fiscal compared to fiscal amortization and write off of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
in connection with the acquisition of msil in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded billion of goodwill and million of acquired intangible assets 
goodwill was initially amortized over its estimated economic life of five years  and acquired intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated economic lives 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we ceased amortizing goodwill of billion beginning february  and have reclassified the carrying value at january  of the acquired workforce of million into goodwill because this intangible asset did not arise from contractual or other legal rights and cannot be separated from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
in january  we decided to no longer use the galileo trade name in selling and marketing activities going forward 
as a result  we wrote off the remaining million net book value of the trade name in the fourth quarter of fiscal the impairment test required upon adoption of sfas and annual impairment review were completed and did not identify any impairment of goodwill 
we plan to perform an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization expense and write off of trade name was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  the decrease in goodwill and acquired intangible assets amortization expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to goodwill no longer being required to be amortized in fiscal partially offset by the million write off of the trade name in fiscal facilities consolidation charge 
during fiscal  we recorded a million charge associated with costs of consolidation of our facilities 
this charge included million in lease abandonment charges relating to the consolidation of our three facilities in the silicon valley into one location 
this charge includes the remaining lease commitments of these facilities reduced by the estimated sublease income throughout the duration of the lease term 
facilities consolidation charge also includes million associated with property and leasehold improvements relating to the abandoned facilities 
we also incurred charges of million through april  as a result of duplicate lease and other costs associated with the dual occupation of our current and abandoned facilities 
the facilities consolidation charge is an estimate as of january  and may change as we obtain subleases for the abandoned facilities and sublease income is known 
at january   cash payments of million had been made in connection with this charge  and million had been accrued and is payable through interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  offset by interest paid on capital lease obligations 
interest and other income  net was million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  the decrease in interest and other income  net in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an overall decline in interest rates on comparable invested cash balances and an increase in interest expense on capital lease obligations  partially offset by realized gains of million on the sale of marketable securities in fiscal versus million of realized gains on the sale of marketable securities in fiscal provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal for fiscal years and  the effective rates were both affected by stock based compensation and non deductible expenses related to the acquisition of msil in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was recorded using purchase accounting 
however  the acquisition related expenses in fiscal created a larger 
table of contents loss than the fiscal acquisition related expenses 
additionally  in fiscal year income earned in locations outside the us were taxed at lower income tax rates 
on january   we acquired msil 
msil s israeli operations have been granted approved enterprise status by the israeli government under the law for the encouragement of capital investments  the investment law 
the approved enterprise status provides a tax holiday on undistributed income derived from operations within certain development regions in israel 
this tax holiday is conditional upon our fulfillment of the conditions stipulated by the investment law  regulations published thereunder and the instruments of approval for the specific investment in approved enterprises 
as the tax holidays expire  we expect that we will start paying income tax on our operations within these development regions 
some of our regional tax holidays have already expired and we are currently paying income taxes in these regions 
years ended january  and net revenue 
net revenue consists primarily of product revenue from sales of our semiconductor devices  and to a much lesser extent  development revenue derived from development contracts with our customers 
net revenue is gross revenue  net of accruals for estimated sales returns and allowances 
net revenue was million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  the increase in net revenue reflects a significant increase in volume shipments of our communications products during the year ended january   in part due to our acquisition of msil 
the increase in net revenue also reflects the commencement of volume shipments of our soc storage products during the year ended january  revenue from communications products totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenue from storage products was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenue derived from development contracts increased sequentially during fiscal and  but represented less than of our net revenues for each year 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing  assembly and test of integrated circuit devices and related overhead costs  and compensation and associated costs relating to manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance personnel 
gross margin  which is calculated as net revenue less cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net revenue  was in the year ended january  compared to in the year ended january  the increase in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher margins on our storage products  which resulted from improved manufacturing yields in  as well as a shift in product mix to newer  higher margin products such as our gigabit ethernet transceivers 
also contributing to the increase in gross margin was an increase in the amount of development revenue recognized in fiscal compared to fiscal the costs associated with contracted development work are included in research and development expense 
our gross margins are primarily driven by product mix  however  our margins may also fluctuate in future periods due to  among other things  increased pricing pressures from our customers and competitors and changes in the amount of development revenue recognized 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to development personnel  prototype costs  depreciation and amortization expense  and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
research and development expense was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  the increase in research and development expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the hiring of additional development personnel and the addition of msil s development personnel which resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million  increased costs of million for prototype and related product tape out costs for new product initiatives  increased depreciation and amortization expense of million arising from purchases of property  equipment and technology licenses and the additional depreciation expense recorded on galileo s property and equipment  and increased facility and other allocated expenses of million related to our expanding operations

general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs relating to administrative personnel  fees for professional services and allocated occupancy costs for these operations 
general and administrative expense was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  the increase in general and administrative expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the hiring of additional administrative personnel and the addition of msil s administrative personnel which resulted in an increase in salary and related costs of million and increased legal and other professional fees of million due to our expanding operations and attorney fees associated with our on going legal proceedings 
amortization of stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to our employees and directors prior to our initial public offering of common stock and in connection with the assumption of stock options as a result of our acquisition of galileo  we have recorded deferred stock based compensation 
deferred stock based compensation is being amortized using an accelerated method over the remaining option vesting periods 
amortization of stock based compensation was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  the increase in amortization expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily resulted from additional amounts of deferred stock based compensation being recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the assumption of stock options in connection with our acquisition of msil 
amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
in connection with our acquisition of msil in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded billion of goodwill and million of acquired intangible assets 
goodwill was amortized over its estimated economic life of five years  and acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated economic lives of five to ten years 
goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization expense was million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended january  the increase in goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization expense in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to goodwill and acquired intangible assets being amortized for the full year in fiscal compared to only seven days of amortization in fiscal in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of msil in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we purchased in process research and development  or iprd  of approximately million  which represented approximately of the total purchase price 
as of the acquisition date  the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the iprd had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the value of the purchased iprd was expensed on the date of acquisition 
the fair values of msil s iprd  as well as their developed technologies  were determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis and venture capital surveys  adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
a discount rate of was used for developed technology  and rates between and were used for iprd  depending on the stage of completion of each technology 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances and realized gains from the sale of marketable 
table of contents securities  offset by interest paid on capital lease obligations 
interest and other income  net was million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  the increase in interest and other income  net in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to interest being earned on higher invested cash balances  as well as realized gains of million on the sale of marketable securities in fiscal the net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock in june  as well as the net cash received as a result of our acquisition of msil in january  contributed to this increase in invested cash balances provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for each of the years ended january  and our effective rate for fiscal was affected by stock based compensation expense as well as non deductible expenses relating to our acquisition of msil in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
excluding the effect of stock based compensation expense and non deductible  acquisition related expenses  our effective tax rate for fiscal was 
excluding the effect of non deductible  acquisition related expenses  our effective tax rate for fiscal was 
our effective tax rate has decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal as a result of our acquisition of msil in the fourth quarter of fiscal a substantial majority of msil s pretax income is generated in israel  where msil s operations have approved enterprise status 
this status provides us with a tax holiday on undistributed income generated in specified regions within israel 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity as of january  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we raised net proceeds of million through our initial public offering in june in addition  we received million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments  before acquisition costs  as a result of our acquisition of msil in the fourth quarter of fiscal we also received million of cash and cash equivalents  before acquisition costs  as a result of our acquisition of syskonnect in june net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  and million for the year ended january  the cash inflow from operations in fiscal was primarily the result of our generation of income during the period excluding the impact of non cash charges and changes in working capital 
non cash charges in fiscal included million related to the amortization and write off of goodwill and intangible assets  million of depreciation and amortization expense  and million of amortization of stock based compensation 
significant working capital changes contributing to positive cash inflow in fiscal included an increase of million in accounts payable resulting primarily from amounts due to our suppliers related to increased inventory purchases during fiscal  an increase of million relating to an accrued facilities consolidation charge recorded during fiscal as a result of the consolidation of our facilities and an increase of million in income taxes payable resulting from effective tax rates that were affected by stock based compensation expense and non deductible expenses related to our acquisition of msil in the fourth quarter of fiscal significant working capital changes offsetting positive cash flow in fiscal included a million increase in accounts receivable which was primarily due to increases in our total net revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal inventory increased by million  primarily as a result of increased volumes of sales and associated purchases of inventory required to meet customer demand 
prepaid and other assets increased by million primarily due to prepayment of a royalty to a customer 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities of million was the result of our generation of income during the period excluding the impact on non cash charges and changes in working capital 
non cash charges in fiscal included million related to the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets  million of depreciation and amortization and million of amortization of stock based compensation 
we generated cash flow primarily from a decrease in inventory of million and increases in accounts payable of million  accrued liabilities and other of million  accrued employee compensation of million and income taxes payable of million 
partially offsetting these benefits were 
table of contents increases in accounts receivable of million  prepaid and other assets of million and deferred income taxes of million 
the decrease in inventory is attributable to improved management of inventory in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which included inventory obtained from the acquisition of msil 
the increase in accounts payable is primarily due to the timing of payments to our suppliers 
the increase in income taxes payable is attributable to effective tax rates that were affected by stock based compensation expense and non deductible expenses related to our acquisition of msil in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities of million was the result of our generation of income during the period excluding the impact on non cash charges and changes in working capital 
non cash charges in fiscal were comprised of million related to in process research and development charges in connection with our acquisition of msil  million related to the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets  million of depreciation and amortization and million of amortization of stock based compensation 
we generated cash flow primarily from an increase in accounts payable of million  accrued liabilities and other of million and income taxes payable of million 
partially offsetting these benefits were increases to accounts receivable of million  inventory of million and prepaid expenses and other assets of million 
the increase in our inventories was due to the ramp up of inventory in anticipation of increased sales 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in our total net revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in accounts payable resulted primarily from the increase in inventory 
the increase in prepaid and other assets is primarily attributable to purchases of technology licenses  prepaid maintenance on software licenses and prepaid insurance 
due to the nature of our business  we experience working capital needs for accounts receivable and inventory 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis with net thirty to sixty day payment terms 
if our sales levels were to increase as they have in all fiscal years  it is likely that our levels of accounts receivable would also increase 
our levels of accounts receivable would also increase if customers delayed their payments or if we offered extended payment terms to our customers 
additionally  in order to maintain an adequate supply of product for our customers  we must carry a certain level of inventory 
our inventory level may vary based primarily upon orders received from our customers and our forecast of demand for these products  as well as the initial production ramp for significant design wins 
other considerations in determining inventory levels may include the product life cycle stage of our products and competitive situations in the marketplace 
such considerations are balanced against risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended january  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended january  and net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended january  the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to purchases of short term investments of million  equity investments in other companies of million  purchases of property  equipment and technology licenses of million  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale and maturities of short term investments of million 
the net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to purchases of short term investments of million  the payment of million of accrued acquisition costs relating to our acquisition of msil  and purchases of property  equipment and technology licenses of million  partially offset by the proceeds from maturities of short term investments of million 
the net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was attributable to the net cash received as a result of our acquisition of msil of million  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  and million for the year ended january  in fiscal and  net cash provided by financing activities was attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities resulted from the proceeds of our initial public offering of common stock in june as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
our relationships with the foundries we utilize allow us to cancel all outstanding purchase orders  provided we pay the foundries for all expenses they have incurred in connection with our purchase orders 
table of contents through the date of cancellation 
as of january   foundries had incurred approximately million of manufacturing expenses on our outstanding purchase orders 
in october  we entered into a lease agreement with yahoo inc to lease a building in california consisting of approximately  square feet 
the lease commenced on january  and continues through march  total rent payments over the term of the lease will be approximately million 
in february  we consolidated our three existing facilities in california into this new building 
the lease on one of our former facilities expired in february  but we have ongoing  non cancelable leases for the two other facilities 
we are currently attempting to secure subtenants for the remainder of our lease terms for these two facilities 
since we have been unable to sublease these two facilities  we will continue to be required to pay the full amount of our contracted lease payments while the facilities are vacant or if they are subleased at a future date at lesser rates 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million charge associated with costs of consolidation of our facilities 
this charge includes the remaining lease commitments of these facilities reduced by the estimated sublease income throughout the duration of the lease term 
during the three months ended october   we recorded an additional million charge associated with the consolidation of our facilities due to a decline in the real estate market in silicon valley 
the charge represents additional lease abandonment charges related to a change in estimated future sublease income for the abandoned facilities 
the facilities consolidation charge is an estimate as of january  and may change as we obtain subleases for the abandoned facilities and sublease income is known 
at january   cash payments of million had been made in connection with this charge 
approximately million is accrued for the facilities consolidation charge as of january  of which million is the current portion while the long term portion totaling million is payable through on february   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire radlan computer communications ltd  a leading provider of embedded networking software 
under terms of the agreement  we will issue a combination of cash  shares  warrants and stock options to purchase our common stock for the remaining outstanding shares of radlan capital stock and employee stock options 
it is estimated that this exchange and the closing of the merger transaction will occur early in our second quarter of fiscal upon the closing  we will issue a total of million shares of common stock and options to purchase common stock 
in addition  we will also issue warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
subsequent to this exchange with the radlan shareholders and employees  we will also issue either an additional million shares of common stock or million to radlan shareholders  depending upon the share price of marvell s common stock upon a date as defined in the merger agreement 
it is estimated that this second distribution will occur within ninety days of the closing of the merger transaction 
additionally  million shares of our common stock will be reserved for the future issuance to both radlan shareholders and employees upon the resolution of certain contingencies involving achievement of milestones as defined in the merger agreement 
we intend to fund our capital requirements  as well as our liquidity needs  with existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as well as cash generated by operations 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  capital requirements  investment requirements and commitments for at least the next twelve months 
however  our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our products  costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  the timing and extent of research and development projects and increases in operating expenses  which are all subject to uncertainty 
to the extent that our existing cash  cash equivalent and investment balances and cash generated by operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than after year years years total contractual obligations operating leases capital lease obligations purchase commitments to foundries total contractual cash obligations inflation the impact of inflation on our business has not been material for fiscal  and recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and assets to be disposed of  and certain provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including discontinued operations  be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas also broadens the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity that have operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
we adopted sfas on february   and the adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas will generally require gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under sfas extraordinary treatment will be required for certain extinguishments as provided in apb opinion no 
the statement also amended sfas for certain sales leaseback transactions and sublease accounting 
we adopted the provisions of sfas effective february  and adoption of sfas is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit and activity including certain costs incurred in restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when a liability is incurred rather than when an exit or disposal plan is approved 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas for any exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on 
table of contents our financial position or results of operations 
however  we may in certain circumstances change the timing of recognition of restructuring costs 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin will significantly change current practice in the accounting for and disclosure of guarantees 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value which is different from the current practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable  as those terms are defined in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote  which is another change from the current practice 
fin disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december   while the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of fin for the year ended january  and since december   the recognition and measurement provisions of fin has not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for fiscal years ended after december  the interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we have chosen to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the estimate of the market value of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire our stock 
we have adopted the annual disclosure provisions of sfas in our financial reports for the year ended january  and will adopt the interim disclosure provisions for our financial reports for the quarter ending may  as the adoption of this standard involves disclosures only  we do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin on our financial position or results of operations 
it is reasonably possible that we are the primary beneficiary of or hold a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity 
we have a equity interest in a company that conducts research and development primarily on our behalf 
our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our investment with the potential variable interest entity is our investment of million  as we are not obligated to provide any additional financing 
related party transaction in october  we entered into a lease agreement with a privately held design technology firm for certain computer aided design software 
we selected this product after an evaluation of competitive products on the strength of its merits 
one of the officers of the design technology firm is the brother of an officer and director of marvell and is also a shareholder of marvell 
the design technology firm was acquired by cadence design systems in december and the lease agreement was subsequently amended in 
table of contents june total principal  interest and maintenance payments over the year term of the lease will be million 
the remaining lease payments as of january  are included in the capital lease commitment table in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additional factors that may affect future results in addition to the factors discussed in the overview and liquidity and capital resources sections of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the following additional factors may affect our future results 
many of these factors are beyond our control  including business cycles and seasonal trends of the computing  semiconductor and related industries 
the continuing worldwide economic slowdown  acts of war  terrorism  international conflicts and related uncertainties may adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
slower economic activity  concerns about inflation  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries  the war in iraq and recent international conflicts  and terrorist and military activity have resulted in a continuing downturn in worldwide economic conditions 
we cannot predict the timing  strength and duration of any economic recovery in the semiconductor industry and in particular  the broadband communications markets 
in addition  the events of september  and the continuing international conflicts and terrorist acts and the possibility of an extended war in iraq can be expected to place further pressure on economic conditions in the united states and worldwide 
these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
if such conditions continue or worsen  our business  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
we are dependent upon the hard disk drive industry  which is highly cyclical and experiences rapid technological change 
sales to customers in the hard disk drive industry represented approximately  and of our net revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the hard disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and the technology changes rapidly 
as a result  this industry is highly cyclical  with periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction 
these cycles may affect us as our customers are suppliers to this industry 
hard disk drive manufacturers tend to order more components than they may need during growth periods  and sharply reduce orders for components during periods of contraction 
in addition  advances in existing technologies and the introduction of new technologies may result in lower demand for disk drive storage devices  thereby reducing demand for our products 
rapid technological changes in the hard disk drive industry often result in significant and rapid shifts in market share among the industry s participants 
if the hard disk drive manufacturers using our products do not retain or increase market share  our sales may decrease 
our marvell semiconductor israel ltd 
subsidiary is incorporated under the laws of  and its principal offices are located in  the state of israel and therefore its business operations may be harmed by adverse political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
marvell semiconductor israel ltd 
msil is both incorporated under the laws of and has its principal offices in the state of israel 
in addition  msil maintains its research and development operations in israel 
thus  msil is directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
major hostilities involving or within israel could disrupt msil s research and development and other business operations 
for example  continued hostilities between israel and the palestinian authority in recent months have caused substantial political unrest  which could lead to a potential economic downturn in israel 
additionally  the on going war in iraq could lead to more economic instability and uncertainty in the state of israel and the middle east 
also  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel could reduce msil s 
table of contents sales and its financial results 
a number of countries restrict business with israel or israeli companies  and if the countries in which msil s customers or potential customers conduct their businesses adopt restrictive laws or policies toward israel or israeli businesses  this could harm msil s ability to retain or increase its sales 
we depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our sales 
the loss of  or a significant reduction or cancellation in sales to  any key customer would significantly reduce our revenues 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenue was derived from sales to five customers  each of whom individually accounted for or more of our net revenue during this period 
of these customers  intel accounted for  samsung accounted for  hitachi accounted for  seagate accounted for and toshiba accounted for 
sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer  as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets  and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future 
the loss of any of our largest customers  a significant reduction in sales we make to them  or any problems we encounter collecting amounts from them would likely seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers  as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products 
in the future  these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all  to purchase fewer products than they did in the past  or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way  particularly because substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis  which permits our customers to cancel  change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty  our customers may develop their own solutions  our customers purchase integrated circuits from our competitors  and our customers may discontinue sales in the markets for which they purchase our products 
if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance in a timely manner  our operating results and competitive position will be harmed 
our future success will depend on our ability  in a timely and cost effective manner  to develop new products for the broadband communications market and to introduce enhancements to our products for the storage market 
we must also achieve market acceptance for these products and enhancements 
if we do not successfully develop and achieve market acceptance for new and enhanced products  our ability to maintain or increase revenues will suffer 
the development of our products is highly complex 
we occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements  and we could experience delays in the future 
in particular  we have a limited history in developing products for the broadband communications market and may encounter technical difficulties in developing wireless lan or other products for this market that could prevent or delay their successful introduction 
unanticipated problems in developing broadband communications products could also divert substantial engineering resources  which may impair our ability to develop new products and enhancements for the storage market  and could substantially increase our costs 
even if the new and enhanced products are introduced to the market  we may not be able to achieve market acceptance of these products in a timely manner 
successful product development and market acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors  including timely and cost effective completion and introduction of new product designs  adoption of our products by customers that are among the first to adopt new technologies and by customers perceived to be market leaders  
table of contents timely qualification and certification of our products for use in our customers products  the level of acceptance of our products by existing and potential customers  cost and availability of foundry  assembly and testing capacity  availability  price  performance  power  use and size of our products and competing products and technologies  our customer service and support capabilities and responsiveness  successful development of our relationships with existing and potential customers and strategic partners  and our ability to predict and respond to changes in technology  industry standards or end user preferences 
in addition  our longstanding relationships with some of our larger customers may also deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products 
to attract new customers or retain existing customers  we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products 
if these prices are lower than the prices paid by our existing customers  we would have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have contractual most favored nation pricing arrangements 
in that event  our average selling prices and gross margins would decline 
the loss of a key customer  a reduction in sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any future acquisitions and transactions may not be successful 
we expect to continue to make acquisitions of  and investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies  augment our market segment coverage  or enhance our technological capabilities 
we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition  investment  alliance  or joint venture opportunities or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or that such transactions or relationships will be successful 
any transactions or relationships will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered with those matters 
risks that could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition include  among other things the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired businesses  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the distraction of management from our business  the potential inability of management to maximize the financial and strategic position of us as a result of an acquisition  the potential difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of any integration of new management personnel  the risk of entering market segments in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such market segments have stronger market segment positions  and the potential loss of key employees of an acquired company 
our pending acquisition of radlan and any future acquisitions could harm our operating results and share price 
on february   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire radlan computer communications ltd  a leading provider of embedded networking software 
under terms of the agreement  we will issue 
table of contents a combination of cash  shares  warrants and stock options to purchase our common stock for the remaining outstanding shares of radlan capital stock and employee stock options 
it is estimated that this exchange and the closing of the merger transaction will occur early in our second quarter of fiscal any acquisitions  including our pending acquisition of radlan could materially adversely affect our operating results as a result of possible concurrent issuances of dilutive equity securities 
in addition  the purchase price of any acquired businesses may exceed the current fair values of the net tangible assets of the acquired businesses 
as a result  we would be required to record material amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets  which could result in significant impairment charges and amortization expense in future periods 
these charges  in addition to the results of operations of such acquired businesses  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot forecast the number  timing or size of future acquisitions  or the effect that any such acquisitions might have on our operating or financial results 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we are required to review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis 
over the last year  there has been a slowdown in worldwide economies  including the united states  which has affected our business 
end customers for our products have slowed their purchases of next generation technology and have delayed or rescheduled existing orders for products that incorporate our technology 
if the economic downtrend continues or if other presently unforeseen events or changes in circumstances arise which indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable  we will be required to perform impairment reviews of these assets  which have carrying values of approximately billion as of january  an impairment review could result in a write down of all or a portion of these assets to their fair values 
the impairment test required upon the adoption of sfas and annual impairment review were completed and did not identify any impairment of goodwill 
we will perform an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
in light of the large carrying value associated with our goodwill and intangible assets  any write down of these assets may result in a significant charge to our statement of operations in the period any impairment is determined and could cause our stock price to decline 
we are a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of our current and potential competitors  and we may not be able to compete effectively and increase or maintain revenue and market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors 
if we do not compete successfully  our market share and revenues may not increase or may decline 
in addition  most of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and name recognition  and a larger base of customers than us 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers 
moreover  our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than us 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than us  which would allow them to respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
in addition  new competitors or alliances among existing competitors could emerge 
we expect to face competition in the future from our current competitors  other manufacturers and designers of integrated circuits  and innovative start up integrated circuit design companies 
many of our customers are also large  established integrated circuit suppliers 
our sales to and support of such customers may enable them to become a source of competition to us  despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights 
in the wireless lan market  we face competition from a number of additional competitors who have a longer history of serving that market 
many of these competitors have more established reputations in that market and longer standing relationships with the customers to whom we sell our products  which could prevent us from competing successfully 
competition could increase pressure on us to lower our prices and lower our margins  which  in turn  would harm our operating results 

table of contents due to our limited operating history  we may have difficulty in accurately predicting our future sales and appropriately budgeting for our expenses  and we may not be able to maintain our existing growth rate 
our limited operating experience  combined with the rapidly changing nature of the markets in which we sell our products  limits our ability to accurately forecast quarterly and annual sales 
additionally  because many of our expenses are fixed in the short term or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales  we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall of sales 
we are currently expanding our staffing and increasing our expense levels in anticipation of future sales growth 
if our sales do not increase as anticipated  significant losses could result due to our higher expense levels 
although we have experienced sales and earnings growth in prior quarterly and annual periods  we may not be able to sustain these growth rates  particularly in the period of economic slowdown we are currently experiencing 
accordingly  you should not rely on the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future performance 
because we do not have long term commitments from our customers  we must estimate customer demand  and errors in our estimates can have negative effects on our inventory levels  sales and operating results 
our sales are made on the basis of individual purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
in addition  our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders 
we have historically placed firm orders for products with our suppliers up to sixteen weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date and typically prior to receiving an order for the product 
therefore  our order volumes are based on our forecasts of demand from our customers 
this process requires us to make multiple demand forecast assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect or at all 
as a result  we would have excess inventory  which would harm our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available  we would forego revenue opportunities  lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
on occasion  we have been unable to adequately respond to unexpected increases in customer purchase orders  and therefore  were unable to benefit from this increased demand 
our future success depends in significant part on strategic relationships with customers 
if we cannot maintain these relationships or if these customers develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solutions instead of buying our products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
in the past  we have relied in significant part on our strategic relationships with customers that are technology leaders in our target markets 
we intend to pursue and continue to form these strategic relationships in the future but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
these relationships often require us to develop new products that may involve significant technological challenges 
our partners frequently place considerable pressure on us to meet their tight development schedules 
accordingly  we may have to devote a substantial amount of our limited resources to our strategic relationships  which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects 
delays in the development could impair our relationships with our strategic partners and negatively impact sales of the products under development 
moreover  it is possible that our customers may develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solution for products that they currently buy from us 
if that happens  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 
we rely on independent foundries and subcontractors for the manufacture  assembly and testing of our integrated circuit products  and the failure of any of these third party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers  decrease our sales and limit our growth 
we do not have our own manufacturing or assembly facilities and have very limited in house testing facilities 
therefore  we must rely on third party vendors to manufacture  assemble and test the products we design 
we currently rely on tsmc to produce substantially all of our integrated circuit products 
we also 
table of contents currently rely on tsmc and other third party assembly and test subcontractors to assemble  package and test our products 
if these vendors do not provide us with high quality products and services in a timely manner  or if one or more of these vendors terminates its relationship with us  we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacements to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis  our relationships with our customers could suffer  our sales could decrease and our growth could be limited 
other significant risks associated with relying on these third party vendors include our customers or their customers may fail to approve or delay approving our selected supplier  we have reduced control over product cost  delivery schedules and product quality  the warranties on wafers or products supplied to us are limited  and we face increased exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
we currently do not have long term supply contracts with any of our third party vendors 
therefore  they are not obligated to perform services or supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantities  or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
none of our third party foundry or assembly and test subcontractors have provided contractual assurances to us that adequate capacity will be available to us to meet future demand for our products 
these foundries may allocate capacity to the production of other companies products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice 
in particular  foundry customers that are larger and better financed than us or that have long term agreements with these foundries may cause these foundries to reallocate capacity to those customers  decreasing the capacity available to us 
if we need another integrated circuit foundry or assembly and test subcontractor because of increased demand  or the inability to obtain timely and adequate deliveries from our providers at the time  we might not be able to develop relationships with other vendors who are able to satisfy our requirements 
even if other integrated circuit foundries or assembly and test subcontractors are available at that time to satisfy our requirements  it would likely take several months to acquire a new provider 
such a change may also require the approval of our customers  which would take time to effect and could cause our customers to cancel orders or fail to place new orders 
if our foundries do not achieve satisfactory yields or quality  our relationships with our customers and our reputation will be harmed 
the fabrication of integrated circuits is a complex and technically demanding process 
our foundries have from time to time experienced manufacturing defects and reduced manufacturing yields 
changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by our foundries could result in lower than anticipated manufacturing yields or unacceptable performance 
many of these problems are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct 
poor yields from our foundries  or defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could cause us significant customer relations and business reputation problems  harm our financial results and result in financial or other damages to our customers 
our customers could also seek damages from us for their losses 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
in addition  defects in our existing or new products could result in significant warranty  support and repair costs  and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts 
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses in undetected defects or bugs  which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products  damage our reputation with current or prospective customers  and materially and adversely affect our operating costs 
highly complex products such as the products that we offer frequently contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects and bugs 
historically  we have been able to design workarounds to fix these defects and bugs with minimal to no disruption to our business or our customers business 
going forward  if any of our products contain defects or bugs  or have reliability  quality  or compatibility problems  we may not 
table of contents be able to successfully design workarounds 
consequently  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers  attract new customers  and our financial results 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers 
to alleviate these problems  we may have to invest significant capital and other resources 
although our products are tested by our suppliers  our customers and ourselves  it is possible that our new products will contain defects or bugs 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts 
moreover  we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
as a result  our financial results could be materially harmed 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration  which may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
in order to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes  which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully and cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition 
if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  or at all 
we depend on key personnel with whom we do not have employment agreements to manage our business  and if we are unable to retain our current personnel and hire additional personnel  our ability to develop and successfully market our products could be harmed 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering and sales and marketing personnel 
the loss of any key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel  including engineers and sales and marketing personnel  could delay the development and introduction of  and harm our ability to sell  our products 
we believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of dr 
sehat sutardja  our co founder  president and chief executive officer  weili dai  our co founder and executive vice president  and dr 
pantas sutardja  our co founder and vice president and chief technology officer 
we do not have employment contracts with these or any other key personnel  and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace 
there is currently a shortage of qualified technical personnel with significant experience in the design  development  manufacture  marketing and sales of integrated circuits for use in communications products 
in particular  there is a shortage of engineers who are familiar with the intricacies of the design and manufacture of products based on analog technology  and competition for these engineers is intense 
our key technical personnel represent a significant asset and serve as the source of our technological and product innovations 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of technical personnel to support our anticipated growth 

table of contents our officers and directors own a large percentage of our voting stock  and three existing directors  who are also significant shareholders  are related by blood or marriage 
these factors may allow the officers and directors as a group or the three related directors to control the election of directors and the approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions 
as of march   our executive officers and directors beneficially owned or controlled  directly or indirectly  approximately of the outstanding shares our common stock 
additionally  sehat sutardja and weili dai are husband and wife and sehat sutardja and pantas sutardja are brothers 
all three are directors and together they held approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  as a result  if the directors and officers as a group or any of sehat sutardja  weili dai  and pantas sutardja act together  they will significantly influence  and will likely control  the election of our directors and the approval or disapproval of our significant corporate actions 
this influence over our affairs might be adverse to the interests of other shareholders 
in addition  the voting power of these officers or directors could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of us on terms that other shareholders may desire 
under bermuda law all of our officers  in exercising their powers and discharging their duties  must act honestly and in good faith with a view to our best interests and exercise the care  diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances 
majority shareholders do not owe fiduciary duties to minority shareholders 
as a result  the minority shareholders will not have a direct claim against the majority shareholders in the event the majority shareholders take actions that damage the interests of minority shareholders 
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda  except the bermuda courts would be expected to follow english case law precedent  which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in our name if the directors or officers are alleged to be acting beyond our corporate power  committing illegal acts or violating our memorandum of association or bye laws 
in addition  minority shareholders would be able to challenge a corporate action that allegedly constituted a fraud against them or required the approval of a greater percentage of our shareholders than actually approved it 
the winning party in such an action generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action 
our rapid growth has strained our resources and our inability to manage any future growth could harm our profitability 
our rapid growth has placed  and any future growth of our operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our management personnel  systems and resources 
we anticipate that we will need to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  including the improvement of our accounting and other internal management systems 
we also expect that we will need to continue to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce 
all of these endeavors will require substantial management effort 
if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations  our operating results could be harmed 
in march  we completed the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system 
an erp system implementation is a very complex  costly and time consuming process 
any unforeseen delays or difficulties after we begin transacting on the new system or in performing financial closes on the new systems  may divert the attention of management and other employees and disrupt our ongoing business and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are not successful in subleasing our unused office space at rates that we have estimated in determining our facilities consolidation charge  we will be required to record a period charge for the difference between the total actual and estimated sublease income and our lease cost 
in october  we entered into a lease agreement with yahoo inc to lease a building in california consisting of approximately  square feet 
the lease commenced on january  and continues through march  total rent payments over the term of the lease will be approximately million 
in february  we consolidated our three existing facilities in california into this new building 
the lease on one of our former facilities expired in february  but we have ongoing  non cancelable leases for the 
table of contents two other facilities 
we are currently attempting to secure subtenants for the remainder of our lease terms for these two facilities 
since we have been unable to sublease these two facilities  we will continue to be required to pay the full amount of our contracted lease payments while the facilities are vacant or if they are subleased at a future date at lesser rates 
in fiscal  we recorded a total of million of charges associated with costs of consolidating our facilities 
these charges include the remaining lease commitments of these facilities of million reduced by the estimated sublease income of million throughout the duration of the lease term 
the facilities consolidation charge is an estimate as of january  and may change as we obtain subleases for the abandoned facilities and sublease income is known 
we face foreign business  political and economic risks  which may harm our results of operations  because a majority of our products and our customers products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states 
a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside of the united states and  as a result  we are subject to foreign business  political and economic risks 
all of our products are manufactured outside of the united states 
our current qualified integrated circuit foundries are located in the same region within taiwan  and our primary assembly and test subcontractors are located in the pacific rim region 
in addition  many of our customers are located outside of the united states  primarily in asia  which further exposes us to foreign risks 
sales to customers located in asia represented approximately  and of our net revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we anticipate that our manufacturing  assembly  testing and sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a substantial portion of our operations and revenue in future periods 
accordingly  we are subject to risks associated with international operations  including difficulties in obtaining domestic and foreign export  import and other governmental approvals  permits and licenses  compliance with foreign laws  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  trade restrictions or higher tariffs  transportation delays  difficulties of managing distributors  especially because we expect to continue to increase our sales through international distributors  political and economic instability  including wars  terrorism  other hostilities and political unrest  boycotts  curtailment of trade and other business restrictions  and inadequate local infrastructure 
because all of our sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar will increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  potentially leading to a reduction in sales and profitability for us in that country 
a portion of our international revenue may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future  which will subject us to risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates for those foreign currencies 
our third party foundries and subcontractors are concentrated in taiwan and elsewhere in the pacific rim  an area subject to significant earthquake risks 
any disruption to the operations of these foundries and subcontractors resulting from earthquakes or other natural disasters could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our products 
substantially all of our products are manufactured by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  which is located in taiwan 
currently our only alternative manufacturing sources are located in taiwan and china 
in addition  substantially all of our assembly and testing facilities are located in singapore  taiwan and 
table of contents the philippines 
the risk of an earthquake in taiwan and elsewhere in the pacific rim region is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines to the facilities of our foundries and assembly and test subcontractors 
in september  a major earthquake in taiwan affected the facilities of several of these third party contractors 
as a consequence of this earthquake  these contractors suffered power outages and disruptions that impaired their production capacity 
in march  another major earthquake occurred in taiwan 
although our foundries and subcontractors did not suffer any significant damage as a result of this most recent earthquake  the occurrence of additional earthquakes or other natural disasters could result in the disruption of our foundry or assembly and test capacity 
any disruption resulting from such events could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing  assembling or testing from the affected contractor to another third party vendor 
we may not be able to obtain alternate capacity on favorable terms  if at all 
we rely on third party distributors and manufacturers representatives and the failure of these distributors and manufacturers representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales 
we sell our communications products to customers primarily through distributors and manufacturers representatives 
our relationships with some of our distributors and manufacturers representatives have been established within the last two years  and we are unable to predict the extent to which our distributors and manufacturers representatives will be successful in marketing and selling our products 
moreover  many of our manufacturers representatives and distributors also market and sell competing products 
our representatives and distributors may terminate their relationships with us at any time 
our future performance will also depend  in part  on our ability to attract additional distributors or manufacturers representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively  especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products 
if we cannot retain our current distributors or manufacturers representatives or recruit additional or replacement distributors or manufacturers representatives  our sales and operating results will be harmed 
the loss of one or more of our distributors or manufacturers representatives could harm our sales and results of operations 
we generally realize a higher gross margin on direct sales and from sales through manufacturers representatives than on sales through distributors 
accordingly  if our distributors were to account for an increased portion of our net sales  our gross margins may decline 
the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased rapidly and will likely do so in the future  which could harm our revenues and gross profits 
the products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications 
as a result  the prices of those products have historically decreased rapidly 
our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes  reducing our costs  or developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits 
we expect that our gross profits on our storage products are likely to decrease over the next fiscal year below levels we have historically experienced due to i pricing pressures from our customers  and ii an increase in sales of socs  which typically have lower margins than standalone read channel devices  and iii an increase in sales of products into consumer application markets  which are highly competitive and cost sensitive 
in addition  if our sales of storage products into the desktop computer market were to increase as a percentage of total storage revenues  our margins would also likely decrease because gross margins on sales into this market are generally lower than for sales into the enterprise and mobile computer markets  where we currently generate the substantial majority of our storage product revenues 
additionally  because we do not operate our own manufacturing  assembly or testing facilities  we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities  and our costs may even increase  which could also reduce our margins 
in the past  we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors 
we expect that we will have to do so again in the future 

table of contents we have a lengthy and expensive storage product sales cycle that does not assure product sales  and that if unsuccessful  may harm our operating results 
the sales cycle for our storage products is long and requires us to invest significant resources with each potential customer without any assurance of sales to that customer 
our sales cycle typically begins with a three to six month evaluation and test period  also known as qualification  during which our products undergo rigorous reliability testing by our customers 
qualification is typically followed by a twelve to eighteen month development period by our customers and an additional three to six month period before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
this lengthy sales cycle creates the risk that our customers will decide to cancel or change product plans for products incorporating our integrated circuits 
during our sales cycle  our engineers assist customers in implementing our products into the customers products 
we incur significant research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses as part of this process  and this process may never generate related revenues 
we derive revenue from this process only if our design is selected 
once a customer selects a particular integrated circuit for use in a storage product  the customer generally uses solely that integrated circuit for a full generation of its product 
therefore  if we do not achieve a design win for a product  we will be unable to sell our integrated circuit to a customer until that customer develops a new product or a new generation of its product 
even if we achieve a design win with a customer  the customer may not ultimately ship products incorporating our products or may cancel orders after we have achieved a sale 
in addition  we will have to begin the qualification process again when a customer develops a new generation of a product for which we were the successful supplier 
also  during the final production of a mature product  our customers typically exhaust their existing inventory of our integrated circuits 
consequently  orders for our products may decline in those circumstances  even if our products are incorporated into both our customers mature and replacement products 
a delay in a customer s transition to commercial production of a replacement product may cause the customer to lose sales  which would delay our ability to recover the lost sales from the discontinued mature product 
in addition  customers may defer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements from our competitors or us 
we are subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit industry 
the current and any future downturns will likely reduce our revenue and result in excess inventory 
the integrated circuit industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the industry has experienced  and is currently experiencing  significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both integrated circuit companies and their customers products and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
the current downturn and any future downturns may reduce our revenue or our percentage of revenue growth on a quarter to quarter basis and result in us having excess inventory 
furthermore  any upturn in the integrated circuit industry could result in increased competition for access to third party foundry  assembly and test capacity 
when demand for foundry capacity is high  we may take various actions to try to secure sufficient capacity  which may be costly and harm our operating results 
availability of foundry capacity has in the recent past been reduced due to strong demand 
in order to secure sufficient foundry capacity when demand is high  we may enter into various arrangements with suppliers that could be costly and harm our operating results  including option payments or other prepayments to a foundry  nonrefundable deposits with or loans to foundries in exchange for capacity commitments  
table of contents contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of integrated circuits over extended periods  issuance of our equity securities to a foundry  investment in a foundry  and other contractual relationships with foundries 
we may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all  and any arrangements may be costly  reduce our financial flexibility  and not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure foundry capacity  we may be obligated to use all of that capacity or incur penalties 
these penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results 
the development and evolution of markets for our integrated circuits are dependent on factors  such as industry standards  over which we have no control 
for example  if our customers adopt new or competing industry standards with which our products are not compatible or fail to adopt standards with which our products are compatible  our existing products would become less desirable to our customers and our sales would suffer 
the emergence of markets for our integrated circuits is affected by a variety of factors beyond our control 
in particular  our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards 
our customers may not adopt or continue to follow these standards  which would make our products less desirable to our customers and reduce our sales 
also  competing standards may emerge that are preferred by our customers  which could also reduce our sales and require us to make significant expenditures to develop new products 
we have made a significant investment in the development and production of our gigabit ethernet products  including our physical layer devices and switched ethernet products 
however  the gigabit ethernet technology is relatively new compared to the more established and megabit per second fast ethernet technologies 
if the gigabit ethernet technology does not achieve widespread market acceptance  our revenue and operating results may be harmed 
we have also made a significant investment in the development of wireless lan products based on the ieee b standard and the pending ieee g standard 
wireless lan technologies are relatively new and many competing standards  such as ieee a and bluetooth tm  exist 
if the b standard and pending g standard does not achieve widespread market acceptance  our revenue and operating results may be harmed 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property  which would negatively affect our ability to compete 
we believe one of our key competitive advantages results from our collection of proprietary technologies that we have developed since our inception 
if we fail to protect these intellectual property rights  competitors could sell products based on technology that we have developed  which could harm our competitive position and decrease our revenues 
we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is and will continue to be important to the success of our business 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and business partners  and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
we have been issued several united states patents and have a number of pending united states patent applications 
however  a patent may not be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
despite our efforts  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or proprietary technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult  and the steps that we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 

table of contents significant litigation over intellectual property in our industry may cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation  which could subject us to liability  require us to stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products 
litigation involving patents and other intellectual property is widespread in the high technology industry and is particularly prevalent in the integrated circuit industry  where a number of companies aggressively bring numerous infringement claims to protect their patent portfolios 
from time to time we receive  and may continue to receive in the future  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused the proprietary rights of other parties 
these claims could result in litigation which  in turn  could subject us to significant liability for damages 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products or using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property  pay damages to the party claiming infringement  attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
we are incorporated in bermuda  and  as a result  it may not be possible for our shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states 
we are organized under the laws of bermuda 
as a result  it may not be possible for our shareholders to effect service of process within the united states upon us  or to enforce against us in united states courts judgments based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states 
most of our executive officers and directors are residents of the united states 
however  there is significant doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state or hear actions brought in bermuda against us or those persons based on those laws 
the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
therefore  a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability  whether or not based solely on united states federal or state securities laws  would not be automatically enforceable in bermuda 
our bye laws contain a waiver of claims or rights of action by our shareholders against our officers and directors  which will severely limit our shareholders right to assert a claim against our officers and directors under bermuda law 
our bye laws contain a broad waiver by our shareholders of any claim or right of action  both individually and on our behalf  against any of our officers and directors 
the waiver applies to any action taken by an officer or director  or the failure of an officer or director to take any action  in the performance of his or her duties with or for us  other than with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the officer or director 
this waiver will limit the rights of our shareholders to assert claims against our officers and directors unless the act complained of involves actual fraud or dishonesty 
thus  so long as acts of business judgment do not involve actual fraud or dishonesty  they will not be subject to shareholder claims under bermuda law 
for example  shareholders will not have claims against officers and directors for a breach of trust  unless the breach rises to the level of actual fraud or dishonesty 
we are subject to uncertainty regarding how the united states federal income tax laws apply to our business 
if our position is disputed  our operating results could be harmed 
in the united states  we pay income tax on the income of our us subsidiaries and may be subject to the us income tax and on any income that is considered to be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states 
the determination of whether the income of a foreign corporation is 
table of contents effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states requires significant management judgment  as it involves a consideration of all the facts and circumstances and the application of legal standards that are uncertain 
our position is that our foreign business operations do not generate any income that is effectively connected with a united states trade or business 
if our position is disputed  the amount we have accrued in our financial statements for united states federal income taxes may be insufficient to the extent of the difference between the income tax rate ultimately determined to apply and the tax rate that we have used to accrue for income taxes in our financial statements 
in addition  we could be required to make significant cash payments for back taxes and interest based on the difference between the income tax rate ultimately determined to apply and the rate at which we paid those taxes 
tax benefits we receive may be terminated or reduced in the future  which would increase our costs 
under current bermuda law  we are not subject to tax on our income or capital gains 
we have obtained from the minister of finance of bermuda under the exempt undertakings tax protection act  as amended  an undertaking that  in the event that bermuda enacts any legislation imposing tax computed on income or capital gains  those taxes should not apply to us until march  however  this exemption may not be extended beyond that date 
the economic development board of singapore granted pioneer status to our wholly owned subsidiary in singapore in july for a period of at least six years  commencing july  as a result  we anticipate that a significant portion of the income we earn in singapore during this period will be exempt from the singapore statutory tax rate 
we are required to meet several requirements as to investment  headcount and activities in singapore to retain this status 
if our pioneer status is terminated early  our financial results could be harmed 
the israeli government has granted approved enterprise status to our wholly owned subsidiary in israel  which provides a tax holiday on undistributed income derived from operations within certain development regions in israel 
in order to maintain our qualification  we must continue to meet specified conditions  including the making of investments in fixed assets in israel 
as our tax holidays expire  we expect that we will start paying income tax on our operations within these development regions 
some of our regional tax holidays have already expired and we are currently paying income taxes in these regions 
if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company  our shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences 
because we are incorporated in bermuda and have operations in the united states  israel and singapore  we are subject to special rules and regulations  including rules regarding a passive foreign investment company  or pfic 
we believe that we are not a pfic  and we expect to continue to manage our affairs so that we will not become a pfic 
however  whether we should be treated as a pfic is a factual determination that is made annually and is subject to change 
if we are classified as a pfic  then each united states holder of our common stock would  upon qualifying distributions by us or upon the pledge or sale of their shares of common stock at a gain  be liable to pay tax at the then prevailing rates on ordinary income plus an interest charge  generally as if the distribution or gain had been earned ratably over the shareholder s holding period 
in addition to the risks related to pfic status  we and our shareholders could also suffer adverse tax consequences if we are classified as a foreign personal holding company  a personal holding company or a controlled foreign corporation 
class action litigation due to stock price volatility or other factors could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
on september   a putative class action was filed in the southern district of new york relating to our initial public offering  or ipo 
in this action  the plaintiffs named several defendants including marvell and two of our officers  one of whom is also a director 
this complaint relating to our ipo has been consolidated with hundreds of other lawsuits by plaintiffs against approximately underwriters and approximately issuers across the united states 
plaintiffs allege that defendants violated various provisions of the securities 
table of contents act of and the securities exchange act of in these actions  plaintiffs seek  among other items  unspecified damages  pre judgment interest and reimbursement of attorneys and experts fees 
a consolidated amended class action complaint against marvell and two of our officers was filed on april  subsequently  defendants in the consolidated proceedings moved to dismiss the actions 
in february  the trial court issued its ruling on the motions  granting the motions in part  and denying them in part 
thus  the cases may proceed against the underwriters and us as to alleged violations of section of the securities act of and section b of the securities exchange act of claims against the individual officers have been voluntarily dismissed with prejudice by agreement with plaintiffs 
these claims and any resulting litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the attention and resources of our management 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
companies in the integrated circuit industry and other technology industries are particularly vulnerable to this kind of litigation due to the high volatility of their stock prices 
accordingly  we may in the future be the target of securities litigation 
any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the attention and resources of our management 
future sales of our common stock in the public market may depress our stock price 
a substantial number of our shares remain available for sale pursuant to rule future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to decline 
as of march   we had  shares outstanding and none of these shares are subject to any lock up agreements 
the market price of our stock could drop significantly if holders of a substantial number of our shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 
in addition  the sale of our shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional stock 
our bye laws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in corporate control  even if the change in corporate control would benefit our shareholders 
our bye laws contain change in corporate control provisions which include authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  and requiring a vote of two thirds of the outstanding shares to approve any change of corporate control 
these change in corporate control provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be a benefit to our shareholders 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline  while variable rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of fixed and variable rate securities including money market funds  corporate debt securities  federal  state  county and municipal debt securities  and foreign government securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of january  in thousands 
this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
expected fiscal year maturity date total fair value variable rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate investment risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments  which totaled million at january   are included in other non current assets in the accompanying balance sheets and all but one of the investments are accounted for under the cost method as our ownership is less than and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations on these companies 
since we own approximately of one privately held company  we are accounting for the investment using the equity method 
we record our percentage of the net income loss to interest and other income net 
to date  amounts recorded to interest and other income net have not been significant 
since our initial investment  one of these equity investments in a privately held company has become marketable upon the investee completing an initial public offering 
such an investment is subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market 
this investment is recorded at market value and is classified as a short term investment in the accompanying balance sheets 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary 
foreign currency exchange risk 
substantially all of our sales and the majority of our expenses to date have been denominated in united states dollars  and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases  we may choose to hedge those exposures in the future
