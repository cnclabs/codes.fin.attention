item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors including  but not limited to  those under business risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading outsourcer of internet banking  payment and customer contact services to financial institution clients nationwide 
our services  branded in the clients name  integrate seamlessly into a single vendor  end to end solution  supported by x customer care  targeted consumer marketing  training and other network and technical professional products and services 
registered customers are the major driver of our revenue 
the number of customers using our services increased by in  resulting in a increase in revenue 
while we have seen some reduction in recurring revenue per user  this has been more than offset by declining costs 
in  we held our cost of revenue flat  driving down our recurring cost per user by and increasing our gross margin by percentage points 
we have long term service contracts with our financial institution clients 
the majority of our revenue is recurring  though these contracts also provide for implementation  set up and other non recurring fees 
internet banking services revenue is based either on a monthly license fee allowing our financial institution client to register an unlimited number of customers  or on a monthly fee for each registered customer 
payment services revenue is based on either a monthly fee for each customer enrolled  a fee per executed transaction  or a combination of the two 
our financial institution clients pay all of our fees and then determine if or how they want to pass these costs on to their customers 
they typically provide internet banking services to customers free of charge  as they derive significant potential benefits including account retention  delivery and paper cost savings  account consolidation and cross selling of other products 
however  almost all of our financial institution clients charge their customers for providing payment services 
as a network based service provider  we have made substantial up front investments in infrastructure  particularly for our proprietary systems 
while we continue to incur ongoing development and maintenance costs  we believe the infrastructure we have built provides us with significant operating leverage 
beginning in  we are undertaking an effort to upgrade and rewrite certain of our applications infrastructure over a period of two to three years 
we expect that this effort will require incremental capital expenditures  primarily for additional development labor  of between million and million over that period 
we continue to automate processes and develop applications that allow us to make only small increases in labor and other operating costs relative to increases in customers and transactions 
we believe our financial and operating performance will be based primarily on our ability to leverage additional users and transactions over this relatively fixed cost base 
critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
the provision for losses on accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts are recognized based on our estimate  which considers our historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data and financial health of specific customers 
our provision for losses on accounts receivable was approximately  on revenues of million and we charged  against the allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended december  at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts was  which represents management s estimate of the probable losses in the accounts receivable balance at december  while the allowance for doubtful accounts and the provision for losses on accounts receivable depend to a large degree on future conditions  management does not forecast significant adverse developments in property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  are recorded at cost 
software and hardware consisting of central processing systems and terminals represent the majority of the property and equipment and is potentially subject to technological changes and obsolescence 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which is generally five years 
equipment recorded under capital leases is amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
the company capitalizes the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
capitalized computer software costs consist primarily of payroll related and consulting costs incurred during the development stage 
the company expenses costs related to preliminary project assessments  research and development  re engineering  training and application maintenance as they are incurred 
capitalized software costs are being depreciated on a straight line method over a period of three years upon being placed in service 
we periodically evaluate the assets for recoverability when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
we generate revenue from service fees  implementation fees  and other supporting services 
revenue from service fees and other supporting services are recognized over the term of the contract as the services are provided 
termination fees are recognized at the time the service is discontinued 
implementation revenue is recognized according to sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which we adopted effective january  accordingly  nonrefundable implementation fees for all contracts and the related incremental direct costs of implementation activities are recognized over the contract term as the services are provided  which typically range from one to five years generally three years 
we periodically assess the recoverability of the deferred implementation costs and believe that the future contractual cash flows are sufficient to cover the carrying amount of the deferred implementation costs 
prior to  we recognized nonrefundable implementation fees as revenue under the percentage of completion method as certain milestone output measures were completed also see note  summary of significant accounting policies  which discusses accounting policies 
financial condition while we achieved operating profitability and net income profitability in the second and third quarters of  respectively  and expect our profitability to be sustainable  we have historically experienced operating losses and negative cash flow due to the initial costs of developing our infrastructure and the early revenues typical of an emerging market segment 
as a result  at december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity and debt securities  and ongoing working capital requirements consist primarily of personnel costs related to providing our services and operating  enhancing and maintaining our systems 
cash and investments in securities available for sale were and million as of december  and  respectively 
the  decrease in cash and investments resulted primarily from cash used for capital expenditures of million offset by cash provided by operating activities of million 
total liabilities decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  primarily as a result of the conversion of million of convertible subordinated notes the convertible notes 
accordingly  as of december   million of the convertible notes  maturing on september   remained outstanding 
during  citigroup acquired our largest client  california federal bank or cal fed  and expects to convert the cal fed customers to the citigroup banking and bill payment platform in the first quarter of we have extended our full service contract with cal fed through the first quarter of and terminated a subsequent bill payment only contract that was to run through in consideration of this extension and termination  we will receive a combination of service and termination fee revenue that will provide us with the expected profit we would have earned from the bill payment only contract 
we expect that the majority of these fees will be recognized in the first quarter of  thereby significantly increasing revenue and profits for that quarter 
while there will then be a subsequent decrease in revenue and profits for the second quarter of  we expect to remain ebitda positive for that quarter and experience continued growth in our non cal fed business 
we also expect to return to net income profitability in the second half of for the year ended december   we derived approximately million in revenue from the banking and customer care portion of services to cal fed and approximately million in revenue from the bill payment portion of services 
cal fed accounted for million or of our revenue for the year ended december  additionally  bb t corporation has announced its intention to acquire our second largest customer  first virginia banks  inc  in the third quarter of online resources has received no definitive notification from first virginia as to the impact of the acquisition  however  the acquisition may result in the migration of first virginia s business to a platform utilized by bb t 
given the expected timing of this transaction  any first virginia migration would likely have little or no effect on expected financial performance 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately million in revenue from the banking and customer care portion of services to first virginia and approximately million in revenue from the bill payment portion of services 
first virginia accounted for million or of our revenue for the year ended december  as with similar service providers  we are vulnerable to a loss of business associated with the acquisition of our clients 
though the loss of cal fed and the potential loss of first virginia may have a temporary impact on our revenue base  the growth in usage among our remaining clients and our ability to attract new clients remains unaffected 
we expect the departure of these clients to have little effect on our long term growth trends 
additionally  our remaining client base contains very little concentration of revenues 
if cal fed and first virginia are removed from our client base  no remaining client accounts for more than of revenue
