critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policy relates to the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses which is based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the company s existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on available information including the composition of the loan portfolio  historical loan losses  specific impaired loans  availability and quality of collateral  age of the various portfolios  changes in local economic conditions  and loan performance and quality of the portfolio 
different assumptions used in evaluating the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses could result in material changes in the company s consolidated financial condition or consolidated financial results of operations 
the company s policies with respect to the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about uncertain matters 
these critical policies and their assumptions are periodically reviewed with the board of directors

loans that are considered to be uncollectable or that have become days or more delinquent are placed on nonaccrual status 
also  during the period  real estate acquired through foreclosure decreased  or  to million at the end of allowance for loan losses management has established a systematic methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses 
this determination is conducted on a quarterly basis using available information including  in part  the composition of the loan portfolio  historical loan losses  availability and quality of collateral  age of various loan portfolios  changes in local economic conditions  and loan performance and quality of the portfolio 
specific allowances are established for certain loans that management considers impaired 
the amount of loans individually evaluated and considered impaired under sfas at december   and  were not considered to be material 
the company increases the allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for loan losses against income 
for the fiscal years ended december    and  the provision for loan losses was   and  respectively 
during the same periods  net loan chargeoffs amounted to   and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans for the fiscal years   and  were   and  respectively 
management believes that the current level of the allowance for loan losses meets the requirement for losses on loans that management considers to be impaired  for known losses  and for risks inherent in the remaining portfolios 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to make evaluations  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if any of the factors used in determining the adequacy of the allowance differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
the allowance for loan losses is subject to periodic evaluation by various regulatory authorities and may be subject to adjustment upon their examination 
management of market risk the company s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk  as the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company s asset liability committee the alco is responsible for monitoring and managing exposure to interest rate risk and ensuring that the level of sensitivity of the company s net portfolio value is maintained within limits established by the board of directors 
through such management  the alco seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates 
during the past year  the alco utilized the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination and retention of short term commercial business loans and nonresidential mortgage loans  emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate home equity lines of credit  emphasizing the origination and retention of one to four family residential adjustable rate mortgage loans  originating all new fixed rate mortgage loans as a broker for a third party  and investing in shorter term investment securities 
the office of thrift supervision  the bank s primary regulator  requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of the bank s cash flow from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items the bank s net portfolio value or npv would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
these computations estimate the effect on a bank s npv from instantaneous and permanent one hundred to three hundred basis point increases and decreases in market interest rates 
the following table presents the bank s projected change in npv at december   as calculated by an independent third party  based upon information provided by the bank 
changes in interest rates projected npv change board limit basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise no change basis point decline basis point decline basis point decline certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of the interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effect of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily change in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity management objective is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on opportunities for expansion 
liquidity management addresses the ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity  to repay borrowings as they mature  and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
the primary sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable  cash flows generated from operations  and cash flows generated by investments 
external sources of funds include increases in deposits and federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
at december   the company had loan commitments excluding undisbursed portions of construction loans of million of million and unused lines of credit of million 
the company believes that it has adequate resources to fund loan commitments as they arise 
if the company requires funds beyond its internal funding capabilities  the company has million in additional advances available from its line of credit from the fhlb 
at december   approximately million of time deposits were scheduled to mature within a year  and the company expects that a portion of these time deposits will not be renewed upon maturity 
if there is a higher than normal level of time deposits that are not renewed at maturity  then the company may experience a decrease in liquidity 
this may result in the company offering higher than market interest rates to maintain deposits  which would increase interest expense 
the company s cash and cash equivalents increased million for the twelve months ended december   compared to a million decrease for the twelve month period ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  during the fiscal year  the company recognized net income of million that increased the cash provided by operating activities 
net cash used for investing activities was million for the fiscal year  compared to a million for the fiscal year 
during net outstanding loans decreased by million  maturities and prepayments of investment and mortgage backed securities amounted to million  sales of investment and mortgage backed securities amounted to million  and purchases of investment and mortgage backed securities amounted to million 
during the period  net loans increased by million  maturities and prepayments of investment and mortgage backed securities totaled million  sales of investment and mortgage backed securities amounted to million  and purchases of investment and mortgage backed securities amounted to million 
during  the company experienced increased loan prepayments due to the historically low level of interest rates 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  this change was primarily due to the million issuance of common stock in also  deposits for the fiscal year decreased by million compared to a million increase during the comparable period of this change in deposits was partly due to some deposit runoff experienced in the first quarter of as a result of the acquisition
