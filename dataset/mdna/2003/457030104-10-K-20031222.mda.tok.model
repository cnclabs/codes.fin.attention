item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding the company s capital expenditures 
competition the supermarket industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins 
the degree of competition the company s stores face varies by location  primarily based on the size of the community the store is located in and its proximity to other communities 
the company s principal competitors are  in alphabetical order  bi lo  inc  food lion  inc  the kroger co  inc  publix supermarkets  inc  wal mart  inc 
and winn dixie stores  inc increasingly over the last few years  competition for consumers food dollars has intensified due to the addition of  or increase in  food sections by many types of retailers such as specialty grocers  drug and convenience stores  national general merchandisers and discount retailers  membership clubs  warehouse stores and super centers 
also  the consumer trend of eating out has made restaurants another significant competitor for food dollars 
supermarket chains generally compete on the basis of location  quality of products  service  price  convenience  product variety and store condition 
the company believes its competitive advantages include convenient locations  the quality of service it provides its customers  competitive pricing  product variety and quality and a pleasant shopping environment  which is enhanced by its ongoing modernization program 
the company s strategy is to place its supermarkets in suburban areas  small towns and rural communities 
because the company has operated in many of its markets longer than its competitors  it has been able to place its stores in prime locations 
furthermore  unlike many of its competitors  the company owns property on which a majority of its stores are located  allowing it the flexibility to expand the store when needed 
by concentrating its operations within a relatively small geographic region  the company is also positioned to more carefully monitor its markets  and the needs of its customers within those markets 
the top management of the company is living and working in its operating region allowing management to quickly identify changes in needs and customer preference 
given the company s size  such managers have direct access to corporate management and are able to receive quick approval to requested changes in operations 
the company can then move quickly to make adjustments in its business in response to changes in the market and customer needs 
the company supports its quality image by carrying high quality perishable items 
one major quality advantage of the company is that it offers its customers usda choice beef cut by butchers located in the stores 
many of ingles competitors do not offer usda choice beef and do not have butchers located in their stores 
the company also carries a wide variety of produce  a quality private label brand plus a variety of popular national and regional brands 
the company s large national and international competitors primary advantages are related to their size 
these larger organizations may have an advantage through stronger buying power and more significant capital resources 
certain competitors  such as super centers  may be able to operate with smaller margins in the food sections of their stores by relying on their higher margins on the general merchandise sections of their stores to compensate 
the company s management monitors competitive activity and regularly reviews and periodically adjusts the company s marketing and business strategies as management deems appropriate in light of existing conditions in the company s region 
the company s ability to remain competitive in its changing markets will depend in part on its ability to pursue its expansion and renovation programs and its response to remodeling and new store openings by its competitors 
seasonality sales in the grocery segment of the company s business are subject to a slight seasonal variance due to holiday related sales 
sales are traditionally higher in the company s first fiscal quarter due to the inclusion of sales related to thanksgiving and christmas 
the company s second fiscal quarter traditionally has the lowest sales of the year  unless easter falls in that quarter 
the fluid dairy segment of the company s business has slight seasonal variation to the extent of its sales into the grocery industry 
the company s real estate segment is not subject to seasonal variations 
employees and labor relations at september   the company had approximately  employees  of which are supermarket personnel 
approximately of these employees work on a part time basis 
none of the employees are represented by a labor union 
management considers employee relations to be good 
the company values its employees and believes that employee loyalty and enthusiasm are key elements of its operating performance 
trademarks and licenses the company employs various trademarks and service marks in its business  the most important of which are its own laura lynn private label trademark and the ingles service mark

you pay a lot less 
september  each registration may be renewed for an additional ten year term prior to its expiration 
the company intends to file all renewals timely

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ingles  a leading supermarket chain in the southeast  operates supermarkets in georgia  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  virginia and alabama 
the company locates its supermarkets primarily in suburban areas  small towns and rural communities 
ingles supermarkets offer customers a wide variety of nationally advertised food products  including grocery  meat and dairy products  produce  frozen foods and other perishables and non food products  including health and beauty care products and general merchandise  as well as quality private label items 
in addition  the company focuses on selling high growth  high margin products to its customers through the development of book sections  media centers  floral departments  bakery departments and prepared foods including delicatessen sections 
during fiscal  the company began adding fuel centers and pharmacies at select store locations 
as of september   the company operates in store pharmacies and fuel centers 
ingles also operates two other lines of business  fluid dairy processing and shopping center rentals 
the fluid dairy processing segment sells approximately of its products to the retail grocery segment and approximately of its products to third parties 
real estate ownership including the shopping center rental segment is an important component of the company s operations  providing both operational and economic benefit 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of ingles financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
self insurance the company is self insured for workers compensation and group medical and dental benefits 
risks and uncertainties are associated with self insurance  however  the company has limited its exposure by maintaining excess liability coverages 
self insurance reserves are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
the estimates are based on data provided by the respective claims administrators 
the majority of the company s properties are self insured for casualty losses and business interruption  however  liability coverage is maintained 
asset impairments beginning in fiscal  the company accounts for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
for assets to be held and used  the company tests for impairment using undiscounted cash flows and calculates the amount of impairment using discounted cash flows 
for assets held for sale  impairment is recognized based on the excess of remaining book value over expected recovery value 
the recovery value is the fair value as determined by independent quotes or expected sales prices developed by internal specialists 
estimates of future cash flows and expected sales prices are judgments based upon the company s experience and knowledge of local operations and cash flows that are projected for several years into the future 
these estimates can fluctuate significantly due to changes in real estate market conditions  the economic environment  capital spending decisions and inflation 
closed store accrual for properties closed prior to december  that were under long term lease agreements  the present value of any remaining liability under the lease  discounted using risk free rates and net of expected sublease recovery  is recognized as a liability and expensed 
for all store closures subsequent to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
effective december   the liability is recognized and expensed based on the difference between the present value of any remaining liability under the lease and the present value of the estimated market rate at which the company expects to be able to sublease the properties 
the company s estimates of market rates are based on its experience  knowledge and typical third party advice or market data 
if the real estate and leasing markets change  sublease recovery could vary significantly from the recoveries originally assumed  resulting in a material change in the company s recorded liability 
vendor allowances the company receives funds for a variety of merchandising activities from the many vendors whose products the company buys for resale in its stores 
these incentives and allowances include volume or purchase based incentives  advertising allowances  slotting fees  and promotional discounts 
the purpose of these incentives and allowances is generally to help defray the costs incurred by the company for stocking  advertising  promoting and selling the vendor s products 
whenever possible  vendor discounts and allowances that relate to buying and merchandising activities are recorded as a component of item cost in inventory and recognized in merchandise costs when the item is sold 
due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances  it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory 
in those instances  the allowances are applied as a reduction of merchandise costs using a rational and systematic methodology  which results in the recognition of these incentives when the inventory related to the initial purchase is sold 
amounts that represent a reimbursement of specific identifiable incremental costs  such as advertising  are recorded as a reduction to the related expense in the period that the related expense is incurred 
results of operations ingles operates on a or week fiscal year ending on the last saturday in september

adoption of this policy resulted in a non cash charge to cost of goods sold of million 
gross profit as a percentage of sales in the grocery department declined due to increased promotional activity

debit and credit card fees rose due to both increased usage and increased transaction fees 
advertising expense decreased due to the revamping of the company s advertising program and the elimination of the less effective promotions 
the decline in insurance expense was due primarily to increased loss control efforts by the risk management department and store operations and to changes made to the self insured group insurance plan in both april and april loss control efforts from the risk management department and store operations include safety training  quick reporting of accidents and swifter disposition of general liability and workers compensation claims 
also  charges made directly to stores per accident have made the stores more proactive in preventing accidents 
changes made to the self insured group plan in april and april include the addition of higher co pays  larger deductibles and larger employee contributions 
rental income  net 
rental income  net decreased million to million for the year from million for the year

operating and administrative expenses 
operating and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended september   from million for the year ended september  as a percentage of sales  operating and administrative expenses were and for the years ended september  and september   respectively 
a variety of factors contributed to the increase 
a breakdown of the major increases decreases in operating and administrative expenses is as follows in millions of sales salaries and wages depreciation and amortization equipment rent warehouse expense insurance salaries and wages  as a percentage of sales  decreased due to a reduction in the number of hours worked by the company s employees in its stores due to the revision of the company s labor standards during fiscal to reflect changes made in the merchandising and operations of the stores

depreciation expense and equipment rent expense increased due to the remodeling and replacement of certain store locations during the prior and current fiscal years 
warehouse expense decreased as a percentage of sales primarily due to lower diesel fuel prices 
the increase in insurance expense is attributable to rising health care costs and increased premiums for liability coverage

liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures the company believes that a key to its ability to continue to develop a loyal customer base is providing conveniently located  clean and modern stores which provide customers with good service and a broad selection of competitively priced products 
as such  the company has invested and will continue to invest significant amounts of capital toward the modernization of its store base 
the company s modernization program includes the opening of new stores  the completion of major remodels and expansion of selected existing stores  the relocation of selected existing stores to larger  more convenient locations and the completion of minor remodeling of its remaining existing stores 
capital expenditures totaled million for the fiscal year ended september   including the opening of four new stores  the replacement of one store  major remodel and expansion of three stores and minor remodels at three stores 
capital expenditures also included the costs of upgrading and replacing store equipment  technology investments  the purchase of future store sites  capital expenditures related to the company s distribution operation and its milk processing plant  and expenditures for stores to open in fiscal capital expenditures totaled million for the fiscal year ended september   including the opening of one replacement store and the completion of two major remodel expansions and ten minor remodels 
this represented a slowing in the dollar amount of capital expenditures typically incurred by the company in a fiscal year 
much of this slowed pace was attributable to the company s efforts to secure long term financing through a high yield debt offering completed in december the majority of capital expenditures on a given project are incurred in the later months of completion of the project 
therefore  the majority of the dollars spent on projects started after the financing was in place were not incurred until after the end of fiscal year ingles capital expenditure plans for fiscal include investments of approximately million 
originally the company planned to invest approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal  however proceeds of million from the sale of a shopping center in the fourth quarter of were designated as a like kind exchange for tax reporting purposes 
under current tax law  the company has days to purchase like kind property in order to defer the million of income tax on the gain from the sale of the shopping center 
therefore capital expenditures for fiscal will include a higher proportion of land purchases than usual in order to qualify for the like kind exchange provisions 
the company plans to open one new store and complete three remodel expansions and two minor remodels in fiscal expenditures will also include investments in stores expected to open in fiscal as well as technology improvements  upgrading and replacing existing store equipment and warehouse and transportation equipment and improvements to the company s milk processing plant 
the company expects that its net annual capital expenditures will remain in the range of approximately to million going forward in order to maintain a modern store base 
the number of projects pursued during each fiscal year could decline to some degree as the company increases the average size of stores being built 
the number of projects may also fluctuate due to the varying costs of the types of projects pursued including new stores  major remodel expansions or minor remodels 
the company makes decisions on the allocation of capital expenditure dollars based on many factors including the competitive environment  other company capital initiatives and its financial condition 
the company does not generally enter into commitments for capital expenditures other than on a store by store basis at the time it begins construction on a new store or begins a major or minor remodeling project 
the company generally engages in major remodeling and new store development on not more than three or four locations at a time 
construction commitments at september  totaled million 
liquidity the company generated million of cash from operations in fiscal cash used by investing activities totaled million comprised of million of capital expenditures during the period  partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of assets 
during fiscal year  the company s financing activities provided million in cash 
proceeds from long term debt totaled million  including the addition of million to the existing notes  while payments on long term debt were million  including the million of debt retired with a portion of the proceeds from the notes 
debt issuance costs of million associated with the issuance of the notes and dividend payments of million reduced cash from financing activities 
at september   the company had lines of credit with five banks totaling million  all of which were unused 
of the million of committed lines of credit  million matures in october  million matures in october and november and million matured in october the lines provide the company with various interest rate options generally at rates less than prime 
the company is not required to maintain compensating balances in connection with these lines of credit 
the company was in compliance with all financial covenants related to these lines of credit at september  the company s principal sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flow from operations  borrowings under its lines of credit and long term financing 
as of september   the company had unencumbered real property and equipment with a net book value of approximately million 
the company believes  based on its current results of operations and financial condition  that its financial resources  including existing bank lines of credit  short and long term financing expected to be available to it and internally generated funds  will be sufficient to meet planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future  including any debt service requirements of additional borrowings 
however  there can be no assurance that any such sources of financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms  or at all 
however  it is possible that  in the future  the company s results of operations and financial condition will be different from that described in this report based on a number of intangible factors 
these factors may include  among others  increased competition  changing regional and national economic conditions  adverse climatic conditions affecting food production and delivery and changing demographics as well as the additional factors discussed below under forward looking statements 
it is also possible  for such reasons  that the results of operations from the new  expanded  remodeled and or replacement stores will not meet or exceed the results of operations from existing stores that are described in this report
