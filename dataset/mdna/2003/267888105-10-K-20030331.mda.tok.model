item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general dmc is a worldwide leader in explosive metalworking and  through its aerospace group  is involved in a variety of metal forming  machining  welding  and assembly activities 
the explosive metalworking business includes the use of explosives to perform metallurgical bonding or metal cladding and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds 
dmc performs metal cladding using its proprietary technologies 
the revenues from our explosive metalworking businesses  as a proportion of consolidated dmc revenues  have increased from in as restated to in and in dmc s aerospace group was formed as a result of the acquisitions of amk welding  spin forge and precision machined products and accounted for  and of our consolidated  and revenues  respectively 
explosive metalworking 
clad metal products are used in manufacturing processes or environments that involve highly corrosive chemicals  high temperatures and or high pressure conditions 
for example  we fabricate clad metal tube sheets for heat exchangers 
heat exchangers are used in a variety of high temperature  high pressure  highly corrosive chemical processes  such as processing crude oil in the petrochemical industry and processing chemicals used in the manufacture of synthetic fibers 
in addition  dmc has produced titanium clad plates used in the fabrication of metal autoclaves to replace autoclaves made of brick and lead for customers in the nickel mining industry 
we believe that our clad metal products are an economical  high performance alternative to the use of solid corrosion resistant alloys 
in addition to clad metal products  the explosive metalworking business includes shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds 
aerospace manufacturing 
products manufactured by our aerospace group are typically made from sheet metal and forgings that are subsequently machined or formed into precise  three dimensional shapes that are held to tight tolerances 
metal machining and forming is accomplished through traditional technologies  including spinning  machining  rolling and hydraulic expansion 
dmc also performs welding services utilizing a variety of manual and automatic welding techniques that include electron beam and gas tungsten arc welding processes 
forming and welding operations are often performed to support the manufacture of completed assemblies and sub assemblies required by our customers 
fabrication and assembly services are performed utilizing close tolerance machining  forming  welding  inspection and other special service capabilities 
our forming  machining  welding and assembly operations serve a variety of product applications in the commercial aircraft  aerospace  defense and power generation industries 
product applications include tactical missile motor cases  titanium pressure tanks for launch vehicles  and complex  high precision component parts for satellites 
impact of sfas no 
in june  the fasb authorized the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill will no longer be amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever indicators of impairment arise 
the goodwill impairment test  which is based on fair value  is to be performed on a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is defined as a sfas no 
operating segment or one level lower 
goodwill will no longer be allocated to other long lived assets for impairment testing under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
under sfas no 
 intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized 
instead they will be carried at the lower cost or market value and tested for impairment at least annually 
all other recognized intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  dmc adopted sfas no 
as of january  and in early disclosed that up to the full amount of the remaining goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of pmp could be impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  dmc completed its evaluation of goodwill impairment at pmp and determined that the remaining goodwill in the amount of  was impaired 
accordingly  we wrote off all of the remaining pmp goodwill  less associated tax benefits of  and reported the resultant after tax loss of  or 
per diluted share  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
restatement of for reorganization 
on july   dmc completed its acquisition of substantially all of the outstanding stock of nobelclad europe sa nobelclad from nobel explosifs france nef 
nobelclad and its wholly owned subsidiary  nitro metall ab nitro metall  operate cladding businesses located in rivesaltes  france and likenas  sweden  respectively 
nef is wholly owned by groupe snpe and is a sister company to snpe  inc  which owns of our common stock 
the purchase price of approximately million was financed through a million intercompany note agreement between dmc and snpe  inc and the assumption of approximately million in third party bank debt associated with nobelclad s acquisition of nitro metall from nef prior to dmc s purchase of nobelclad stock 
as a result of dmc and nobelclad both being majority owned by groupe snpe  the acquisition of nobelclad has been accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control 
our historical financial position and operating results have been restated to reflect the addition of the nobelclad and nitro metall historical financial results as if the companies had been consolidated from june  the date on which groupe snpe acquired its majority ownership in dmc 
due largely to the operating loss we incurred during  dmc violated certain financial covenants under its debt agreements beginning with the quarter ended september  once it became apparent that financial covenant violations under our debt agreements would continue  we began to evaluate various business strategies and financing alternatives in connection with the need to restructure our debt agreements and or re capitalize our balance sheet 
these efforts culminated in dmc entering into a stock purchase agreement the agreement with snpe  inc snpe that was signed on january  and subsequently approved by our stockholders on june  the closing of the transaction  which was held immediately following stockholder approval  resulted in a payment from snpe of  to dmc in exchange for  of dmc s common stock at a price of per share causing snpe to become a majority stockholder of dmc on the closing date 
we also borrowed  on june  under a credit facility with snpe that was replaced by a bank credit facility in december dmc generated significant operating income in and due to the strong financial performance of its explosive metalworking group  which had earned a small operating profit in after incurring significant operating losses in in  the company experienced significant operating losses as a result of a significant decline in sales revenue and gross margin levels within its aerospace group 
dmc has also experienced  and expects to continue to experience  quarterly fluctuations in operating results caused by various factors  including the timing and size of orders from major customers  customer inventory levels  shifts in product mix  the occurrence of acquisition and divestiture related costs  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the ongoing war in iraq  the threat of terrorism and other geopolitical uncertainty could have a negative impact on the global economy  the industries served by dmc and dmc s operating results 
we typically do not obtain long term volume purchase contracts from our customers 
quarterly sales and operating results therefore depend on the volume and timing of backlog as well as bookings received during the quarter 
a significant portion of our operating expenses is fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs 
if sales do not meet our expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall 
in addition  dmc uses numerous suppliers of alloys  steels and other materials for its operations 
we typically bear the short term risk of alloy  steel and other component price increases  which could adversely affect our gross profit margins 
although dmc will work with customers and suppliers to minimize the impact of any component shortages  component shortages have had  and are expected from time to time to have  short term adverse effects on the our business 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for increased to  from  in sales by our explosive metalworking group  which include explosion bonding of clad metal and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds  increased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
explosive metalworking group results for and include net sales of nobelclad europe in the amounts of  and  respectively 
the increase in worldwide explosive metalworking group sales is principally attributable to more than million of shipments in support of inco s goro nickel project in new caledonia 
our aerospace group contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
this decrease of  or  reflects year to year sales decreases of and at precision machined products pmp and spin forge  respectively  that were only partially offset by a sales increase at amk welding 
gross profit 
gross profit for increased by to  from  in our consolidated gross profit margin for both years was 
the gross profit margin for our explosion metalworking group increased from in to in  while the gross profit margin for the aerospace group decreased to in from in the increase in the gross profit margin for the explosive metalworking group is principally due to increased sales relating to the goro nickel project and the more favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses that resulted from the higher sales volume 
the decline in the gross margin rate for the aerospace group is principally due to the poor sales performance of pmp and spin forge where negative gross margins of and  respectively  were reported in compared to positive gross margins of and  respectively  in the negative gross margins are largely attributable to sales for these two divisions being at levels that did not provide for full coverage of their respective fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  to  in from  in the decline in general and administrative expenses reflects staffing reductions in the administration of our aerospace group and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in this decreased percentage is attributable to increased sales and lower year to year spending levels for our us operations 
selling expense 
selling expenses increased by to  in from  in the increase in selling expenses relates to increased compensation expense associated with higher bonuses for the explosive metalworking group and annual salary adjustments 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses decreased from in to in due to the increase in net sales 
income from operations 
dmc reported income from operations of  in  an increase of  or  from the  reported in this year to year increase reflects a significant improvement in operating results for our explosive metalworking group that was partially offset by an increased operating loss for our aerospace group 
our explosive metalworking group reported income from operations of  in as compared to  in this increase in operating income is largely attributable to the sales increase discussed above 
with no large projects like the goro nickel project on the horizon  the explosive metalworking group is likely to have difficulty matching its sales and operating income performance in dmc s aerospace group reported a loss from operations of  in compared to an operating loss of  in the group s increased operating loss is attributable to the previously discussed significant decline in sales and gross profit at pmp and spin forge that was only partially offset by excellent operating results at amk welding 
with the exception of amk welding who expects another strong year in  our aerospace group continues to suffer from the depressed commercial aircraft market and decreased demand for satellite and launch vehicle component parts 
given the current economic environment  our previously stated goal of returning the group to profitability for the full year may be difficult to achieve 
interest expense  net 
interest expense decreased by to  in from  in this decrease relates principally to a decline in interest rates during the year but also reflects lower average borrowings during the latter part of outstanding borrowings were reduced to  at december  from  at the end of related party interest expense totaled  and  in and  respectively 
income tax provision 
dmc recorded a consolidated income tax provision of  in on income before income taxes  extraordinary item and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as compared to a consolidated income tax provision of  in this significant increase reflects an increase in the effective tax rate to in from in the and income tax provisions include  and  respectively  related to us taxes  with the remainder relating to foreign taxes associated with the acquired operations of nobelclad 
the tax provision in the us was low because dmc was able to generate enough taxable income in to allow it to fully recognize the tax benefits associated with operating loss carry forwards for which valuation allowances has been established as of december  income tax provisions on the and earnings of nobelclad and nitro metall have been provided based upon the respective french and swedish statutory tax rates 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
on january   dmc adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and in early disclosed that up to the full amount of the remaining goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of pmp could be impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our evaluation of goodwill impairment at pmp and determined that the remaining goodwill in the amount of  was impaired 
accordingly  we wrote off all of the remaining pmp goodwill  less associated tax benefits of  and reported the resultant after tax loss of  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
net income 
the company recorded net income of  in compared to net income of  in this decline is attributable to the  goodwill impairment charge discussed above and an increase in the effective income tax rate to in from in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for increased to  from  in sales by the explosive metalworking group  which includes explosion bonding of clad metal and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds  increased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
the significant explosive metalworking group sales increase is attributable to the acquisition of nobelclad and improved domestic demand for clad metal plate 
nobelclad s net sales for the full year and the last six months of are included in the company s consolidated financial statements and totaled  and  for the respective periods 
the company s aerospace group contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
this increase of  or  reflects year to year sales increases of and at amk welding and spin forge  respectively  that were partially offset by a sales decrease at precision machined products 
gross profit 
gross profit for increased by to  from  in the company s gross profit margin for was  a increase from the gross profit margin of in the gross profit margin for the company s explosion metalworking group increased from in to in  while the gross profit margin for the aerospace group decreased to in from in the large increase in the gross profit margin for the explosive metalworking group is principally due to improved market conditions  favorable changes in product mix  continual improvements in operating efficiency at the group s new production facility in mount braddock  pennsylvania and the acquisition of nobelclad whose gross margin increased slightly from in to in the decline in the gross margin rate for the aerospace group reflects a significant improvement in amk welding s gross margin and a modest improvement in the spin forge gross margin that were more than offset by the poor margin performance of the group s precision machined products division pmp whose gross margin fell from approximately in to less than in pmp s gross margin decline is principally attributable to product mix changes but also reflects a reduction in sales that resulted in a lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  to  in from  in if the general and administrative expenses of nobelclad were excluded from the totals  general and administrative expenses would have decreased by to  in from  in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in this decreased percentage is attributable to the increase in the company s sales during and lower year to year spending levels for the company s us operations and for nobelclad 
selling expense 
selling expenses increased by to  in from  in as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses decreased from in to in if the selling expenses of nobelclad were excluded from the totals  selling expenses would have increased by only to  in from  in this increase relates principally to compensation expense related to bonuses associated with the explosive metalworking group s strong financial performance 
income loss from operations 
the company reported income from operations of  in compared to a  loss from operations in the  year to year increase in the company s income from operations reflects a significant improvement in operating results for the explosive metalworking group and a reduced operating loss for the aerospace group 
the explosive metalworking group reported income from operations of  and  in and  respectively 
this dramatic improvement in operating results is primarily attributable to the group s ability to increase its gross margin from in to in the company s aerospace group reported a loss from operations of  in as compared to an operating loss of  in both amk welding and spin forge reported improved operating results in that were partially offset by an increased operating loss at pmp 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by to  in from  in this decrease relates principally to the significant decline in interest rates during as average borrowing levels did not change significantly from to the reduction in revolving credit debt that was made possible by snpe inc s june  equity investment in the company was largely offset by the term loan and revolving credit debt that was incurred in connection with the company s july  acquisition of nobelclad and its nitro metall subsidiary 
total related party interest expense was  and  in and  respectively 
income tax provision 
the company recorded a consolidated income tax provision of  in versus  in of which  and zero  respectively  related to us taxes  with the remainder relating to foreign taxes associated with acquired operations of nobelclad 
the company did not record a us tax benefit in its december  financial statements since it had utilized all of its tax loss carry backs in and the company s financial position and near term operations outlook as of december  made the future realization of tax benefits associated with net operating loss carry forwards uncertain 
thus  the company recorded a large valuation allowance as of december  that it was able to reverse when it generated taxable income in and recognized the tax benefits associated with its operating loss carry forwards 
the provision for us taxes includes alternative minimum tax expense of  and deferred tax expense of  income tax provisions on the and earnings of nobelclad and nitro metall have been provided based upon the respective french and swedish statutory tax rates 
historically  in the absence of operating loss carry backs  operating loss carry forwards and any related valuation allowance  the company s effective tax rate has ranged from to 
net income loss 
the company recorded net income of  in compared to a net loss of  in this significant improvement is principally attributable to the  increase in income from operations discussed above and also reflects the benefit of a low  effective income tax rate in  as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources historically  dmc has obtained most of its operational financing from a combination of operating activities and an asset backed revolving credit facility 
due primarily to the operating losses incurred during and the first quarter of  we violated certain financial covenants under both the revolving credit facility that was then in effect and the reimbursement agreement related to the letter of credit supporting payment of principal and interest under the company s industrial development revenue bonds used to finance the construction of its manufacturing facilities in pennsylvania 
on june   our stockholders approved a stock purchase agreement between dmc and snpe  inc snpe 
the closing of the transaction  which was held immediately following stockholder approval  resulted in a payment from snpe of  to dmc in exchange for  shares of dmc common stock at a price of per share causing snpe to become a majority stockholder of dmc on the closing date 
an additional  cash payment was made by snpe to dmc to purchase a five year  convertible subordinated note that is convertible in whole or in part into common stock by snpe at a conversion price of per share 
we also borrowed  on june  under a credit facility with snpe that carried interest at the federal funds rate plus and provided for maximum borrowings of  proceeds from the snpe equity investment  convertible subordinated note issuance and credit facility borrowings aggregated  and enabled us to repay all outstanding borrowings under a bank revolving credit facility on which we had been in default since september  the bank revolving credit facility was terminated on june  as a result of the snpe debt and equity infusion  we were also able to restructure financial covenants under a reimbursement agreement with our bank relating to a letter of credit in support of the our outstanding industrial development revenue bonds 
this original bank letter of credit  which expired in september  was secured by the us based accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment of our explosive metalworking group and the bond proceeds not yet expended for construction 
on september   we obtained a replacement letter of credit from a different bank that has a five year term and does not require an asset pledge 
in connection with its july  acquisition of nobelclad  dmc entered into a  term loan agreement with snpe 
the term loan bears interest at the federal funds rate plus  payable quarterly 
commencing september  and on the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter  principal payments of  are due  with a final principal payment of  being due on june  the term loan is secured by a pledge of of the capital stock of nobelclad held by dmc 
in anticipation of its acquisition by dmc  nobelclad acquired the stock of nitro metall and financed this acquisition with proceeds obtained from a revolving credit facility with a french bank that provides for maximum borrowings of  euros  based upon the december  exchange rate 
this bank line of credit  which had outstanding borrowings of  on december   carries interest at the euro interbank offered rate euribor plus 
beginning on june  and on each anniversary date thereafter until final maturity on june   maximum borrowings available under the line become permanently reduced by  euros 
the bank has the option of demanding early repayment of any outstanding loans if groupe snpe s indirect ownership of nobelclad falls below 
nobelclad also maintains a million euro  based upon the december  exchange rate intercompany working capital line with groupe snpe under which borrowings of  were outstanding as of december  this intercompany line bears interest at euribor plus 
in december  we obtained a  revolving line of credit with a us bank that replaced the  credit facility between dmc and snpe  inc this new bank line of credit is being used to finance ongoing working capital requirements of our us operations 
initial proceeds from the bank line of credit were used to repay  of borrowings that were outstanding under the credit facility with snpe  inc the bank line  which expires on december   carries an interest rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus through february  and the bank s prime rate plus thereafter 
borrowings under the line of credit are limited to a calculated borrowing base that is a function of inventory and accounts receivable balances and are secured by accounts receivable and inventories of our us operations and by new investments in property  plant and equipment with respect to us operations that are made during the term of the agreement 
as of december   borrowing availability under the line of credit was approximately million greater than the  in outstanding borrowings as of that date 
we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund working capital  debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements of our current business operations for the foreseeable future 
however  a significant portion of our sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers  therefore  the failure to perform existing contracts on a timely basis  and to receive payment for such services in a timely manner  or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities 
consequently  any restriction on the availability of borrowing under the our credit facilities could negatively affect our ability to meet future cash requirements 
dmc attempts to minimize its risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality  delivering product on time and competing favorably on the basis of price 
risks associated with the availability of funds are minimized by borrowing from multiple lenders 
the nature of dmc s business is largely insulated from the negative effects of inflation on sales and operating income because the pricing on custom orders reflects current raw material and other manufacturing costs 
the company s existing loan agreements include various covenants and restrictions  certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders  redemption of capital stock  incurrence of additional indebtedness  mortgaging  pledging or disposition of major assets and maintenance of specified financial ratios 
as of december   the company is in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of its debt agreements

future capital needs and resources we anticipate that  for the foreseeable future  significant amounts of available cash flows will be utilized for operating expenses to support our domestic and foreign manufacturing operations  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  and other general corporate expenditures 
we expect cash inflows from operating activities to exceed outflows for the full year however  our success depends on the execution of our strategies  including our ability to secure an adequate level of new customer orders at all operating divisions  and continue to implement the most cost effective internal processes 
based on available cash resources  anticipated capital expenditures and projected operating cash flow  we believe that we will be able to fully fund our operations during in making this assessment  we have considered presently scheduled debt service requirements during  as well as the availability of funding related to our line of credit with snpe and our bank lines of credit  the anticipated level of capital expenditures in  and our expectation of realizing positive cash flow from operations in critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
we determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation and impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks 
revenue recognition 
the company s contracts with its customers generally require the production and delivery of multiple units or products 
the company records revenue from its contracts using the completed contract method as products are completed and shipped to the customer 
if  as a contract proceeds toward completion  projected total cost on an individual contract indicates a potential loss  the company provides currently for such anticipated loss 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market value 
cost elements included in inventory are material  labor  subcontract costs and factory overhead 
impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the functional currency for the company s foreign operations is the applicable local currency for each affiliate company 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency are translated at exchange rates in effect at period end  and the statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates during the period 
exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars that result in unrealized gains or losses are referred to as translation adjustments 
cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in other cumulative comprehensive income loss 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise 
subsequent changes in exchange rates result in transaction gains and losses which are reflected in income as unrealized based on period end translations or realized upon settlement of the transactions 
cash flows from the company s operations in foreign countries are translated at actual exchange rates when known  or at the average rate for the period 
as a result  amounts related to assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows will not agree to changes in the corresponding balances in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effects of exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign currencies are reported as a separate line item below cash flows from financing activities
