recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supercedes both fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in opinion 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas for example  sfas provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas  sfas does not address the impairment of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets
