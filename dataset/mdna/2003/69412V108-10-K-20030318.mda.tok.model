demand deposits were  or of total deposits at year end december  and accounted for  or of the growth in total deposits 
results of operations net interest income the largest component of the company s earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income derived from earning assets  principally loans  and the interest expense associated with interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits 
the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources  market rates of interest  demand for loans  and the availability of deposits affect net interest income 
two tables follow which analyze the change in net interest income for   and table i  average balance  analysis of net interest earnings  provides information with regard to average balances of 
table of contents assets and liabilities  as well as associated dollar amounts of interest income and interest expense  relevant average yields or rates  and net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
table ii  analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense  shows the increase decrease in the dollar amount of interest income and interest expense and the differences attributable to changes in either volume or rates 
changes not solely due to volume or rate are allocated to rate 
compared to net interest income for was  an increase of  or over net interest income of  for the year  net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets decreased by from in to in market interest rates were relatively stable during with the exception of a decline in november the federal reserve aggressively lowered market interest rates during  with the prime lending rate falling 
including the latest drop by the federal reserve in november  market interest rates have fallen over the past months and are now at their lowest levels in the past years 
during  the company was able to maintain a high yield on its earning assets due to the activation of interest rate floors  while at the same time lowering its cost of funds 
during  the company s cost of funds remained relatively stable  while earning asset yields declined as new loans were booked at low interest rates and existing loans renewed or repriced  which deactivated interest rate floors 
the high level of nonperforming loans during was also a factor in declining loan yields 
this resulted in compression of the net interest margin throughout as evidenced by the margins reported on a quarterly basis of in first quarter  in second quarter  and in both the third and fourth quarter of the company expects margin compression to continue during the first half of  as yields on earning assets are projected to continue to fall  while funding costs remain stable  as many of the rates on the bank s deposit products are at practical floors 
interest and fees on earning assets declined by  or to  referring to table ii  total interest income and fees improved by  due to increased earning asset volumes  which was offset by a  decline in interest income due to lower yields on earning assets 
average earning assets for were  up  or over all of the growth in earning assets was attributable to loan growth as average loans increased  or 
a decline of  in average securities available for sale offset a portion of the loan growth during referring to table i  earning asset yields declined by from in to in this decline resulted primarily in the drop in loan yields  which were in  down from as new loans and existing loans were priced at lower yields throughout in addition  interest reversed and forgone on nonaccrual loans negatively impacted earning asset yields 
interest reversed and forgone totaled approximately or of earning assets 
at december   the company had approximately  variable rate loans or of the total loan portfolio 
approximately  variable rate loans have active interest rate floors 
the active interest rate floors on a large portion of total variable rate loans are expected to mitigate some of the margin compression expected during interest expense on interest bearing liabilities decreased by  or 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities was in  down from referring to table ii  the decline in interest expense was entirely due to the decrease in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  which lowered interest expense by  lower rates on money market accounts  now accounts  and time deposits accounted for  or of the decrease in interest rates 
changes in liability mix and increased volumes offset this decrease by the decline in interest expense due to rates reflects the low market interest rate environment for the entire year in addition  the growth in money market accounts  savings accounts  and non interest bearing accounts allowed the company to minimize dependence on higher rate sources of funding  specifically time deposits 
the company s net interest margin continued to benefit from growth in noninterest bearing deposits 
for the year ended december   average noninterest bearing deposits were  up  or over 
table of contents last year 
average noninterest bearing deposits accounted for of total assets 
at december   total noninterest bearing deposits were  and represented of total deposits 
compared to net interest income for was  an increase of  or over net interest income of  for the year  net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets increased by from in to in during the year  the federal reserve aggressively lowered market interest rates in response to economic conditions  which resulted in a decline in the prime lending rate 
the company s net interest margin improved despite the significant decline in market interest rates 
the company was able to lower its costs of interest bearing liabilities during due to lower rates paid on deposit accounts and the company s effectiveness in shortening the maturity structure of its interest bearing liabilities in order to take advantage of falling market rates 
conversely  the company was able to maintain a high yield on its earning assets  which dropped only from to  due to the activation of interest rate floors on existing loans 
interest and fees on earning assets declined by  or to  referring to table ii  total interest income improved by  due to increased earning asset volumes  which was offset by a  drop in interest income due to lower yields on earning assets 
average earning assets grew by  or 
loan growth accounted for all of the growth in earning assets 
referring to table i  loan yields declined by due primarily to the decrease in the prime lending rate  which affected yields on variable rate loans and new loan production 
in addition  interest reversed and forgone on nonaccrual loans negatively impacted earning asset yields 
interest reversed and forgone on nonaccrual loans for the year totaled approximately or of earning assets 
the activation of interest rate floors during the first half of on variable rate loans mitigated the decline in earning asset yields 
at december   the company had approximately  variable rate loans of which approximately  had active interest rate floors 
interest expense on interest bearing liabilities decreased by  or 
referring to table ii  interest expense decreased due to the change in mix of interest bearing liabilities 
growth in money market and now account volumes combined with the use of term borrowings from the federal home loan bank of seattle allowed the company to reduce the volumes of high cost national time deposits and public time deposits 
again  referring to table ii  interest expense declined by  due to lower rates on interest bearing liabilities  which was directly related to the decrease in market interest rates and the ability of the company to restructure liability maturities 
the decline of on money market and now accounts combined with a decline in time deposit rates accounted for  of the total decline in interest expense 
finally  the company s margin was positively impacted by the growth in noninterest bearing deposits 
current year average noninterest bearing deposits grew by  or over last year 
noninterest bearing deposits account for of the company s total average assets

the level of the allowance is determined based upon judgments regarding the size and nature of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  the financial condition of borrowers  the level of nonperforming loans  and anticipated general economic conditions 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes the collection of principal is unlikely 
the provision for loan losses totaled  in   in  and  in the larger provisions in reflects growth in the loan portfolio  specifically identified risks in the company s loan portfolio  increased loan losses in  and a general decline in economic conditions during  which specifically affected the hotel motel industry 
the provision for loan losses for includes  related to two borrowers in the hotel motel industry 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was  of loans compared to  of loans and  of loans at years end and  respectively 
the amount includes in specific allowance for impaired loans 
at december   the company had  of impaired loans net of government guarantees 
loans in the hotel motel industry account for  or of impaired loans at year end and include one hotel motel loan of  on nonaccrual status and one hotel motel loan of  that was restructured and now performing 
at december   the company had  of impaired loans net of government guarantees with a specific allowance assigned of  at year end  the company classified no loans as impaired 
loans in the hotel motel industry totaled  or of outstanding loans at december  management has carefully evaluated the hotel motel loans in its portfolio and believes it has recognized and reserved for all presently known and estimated losses 
the ultimate collectibility of loans and sale of properties 
table of contents is affected by the health of the regional hotel motel industry  which has suffered both a national and regional decline over the past year 
in view of the uncertainties in the hotel motel industry  the company is closely monitoring loans made by the bank and related properties taken in foreclosure in this industry 
accordingly  it is possible that additional loans may go on nonaccrual status or not perform according to contract terms 
further losses  increased provisions for loan losses  and higher noninterest expense may be experienced related to loans in the motel hotel industry 
given the impact of the weak economy and its impact on the motel hotel industry  it is the bank s present intention to limit and decrease its concentration in this industry as the loan portfolio grows 
during the fourth quarter the company charged off  on the portland area hotel identified in its q for the period ending september  and commenced foreclosure proceedings on the  balance on nonaccrual status 
the company does not expect quick resolution to this particular matter 
the  charge and remaining investment in the loan of  reflect management s estimate of the underlying value of the hotel property 
this estimate was based upon a current appraisal  which was discounted to allow for holding and sales costs 
the current appraisal accounted for current low and projected occupancy rates and also included comparisons to recent sales of distressed properties in the hotel motel industry 
net loan charge offs were  in compared to in  and  in net charge offs during in the hotel motel industry accounted for  or of total charge offs for the year and related to two borrowers in the hotel motel industry 
the hotel motel charge offs include the  charged off during the fourth quarter and  charged off during the first quarter the company foreclosed and assumed ownership of two motel properties related to the first quarter charge off 
the two properties were transferred to other real estate owned and account for the entire balance of in foreclosed properties 
both properties are open and being operated by a professional hotel motel management firm 
the properties are listed with a commercial real estate broker  however  no sales are currently pending 
the company is pursuing legal remedies on one property where the company believes there are actionable issues related to the construction of the hotel 
the company expects additional information will be available and movement may occur by the defendants in the litigation sometime during the second half of the second motel property in foreclosed properties is in need of repair 
the company expects to receive firm bids for the required repair work during the first quarter management will evaluate the prospects of making the repairs or to sell the property in its current condition 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate for estimated loan losses based on management s assessment of various factors including present past due and impaired loans  past history and loss experience  loan concentrations in specific industries  and current economic conditions 
management anticipates that given the current economic weakness that further loan workouts and foreclosure actions may occur during noninterest income noninterest income is income derived from sources other than fees and interest on earning assets 
the company s primary sources of noninterest income are service charge fees on deposit accounts  merchant bankcard activity  income derived from mortgage banking services  and gains on the sale of loans 
compared to year to date december  noninterest income was  up or over for the year  noninterest income accounted for of total operating revenue net interest income plus noninterest income 
growth in noninterest income for the year was attributable to four categories 
service charges on deposit accounts increased or 
the growth in service charges reflects an increase in new clients and accounts 
in addition  lower earnings credit on analyzed accounts led to higher hard dollar fees as earnings on balances in demand accounts were not sufficient to cover the cost of services provided 
revenues from the company s merchant bankcard division continued to show double digit growth 
merchant bankcard fees for the year were  up or 
this increase was due to growth in the client base and an increase in 
table of contents sales volume 
sales volume for was approximately  compared to  in mortgage banking noninterest income was for the year  an increase of or 
this increase resulted from a significant increase in loan originations as interest rates were at year lows 
during  the company originated  in residential mortgage loans compared to  for the year the other noninterest income category also showed significant growth  as the company entered into new businesses and developed new revenue sources 
the consumer finance division generated compared to for in addition  the company generated in new revenues from production of cd rom statements for clients  a product of investments made in technology during the fourth quarter of finally  more than in revenues were generated in trustee fees as the company used in house attorneys to process loan documents on real estate related loans 
increased income in these categories was offset by declines in three categories 
loan servicing fees were down or reflecting a decline in the servicing portfolio throughout the year gains on sales of loans were down or 
the company sold approximately  in loans during compared to  during finally  gains on sales of securities for were compared to in  a decrease of or 
compared to year to date noninterest income was  up or over for the year  noninterest income accounted for of total operating revenue  compared to for growth in noninterest income during was attributable to five categories 
revenues on deposit accounts grew by or 
other fee income  principally merchant bankcard processing fees  were up or due to increased volumes and the addition of new clients 
mortgage banking income and gain on sales of loans increased by or 
residential mortgage revenues increased or due to the high level of home sales and refinancing activities in the low interest rate environment  while gain on sales of loans decreased during  the company sold approximately  of government guaranteed loans  compared to  during loan servicing fees improved by or due to an increase in the loan servicing portfolio  which resulted from approximately  in loan sales during the fourth quarter and first quarter finally  gains on the sales of securities were for the year compared to a loss of recorded in noninterest expense noninterest expense represents all expenses other than interest costs associated with deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
it incorporates personnel  premises and equipment  data processing and other operating expenses 
compared to year to date noninterest expense at december  was  up  or over during the third quarter  the company recorded one time executive severance expense of excluding the one time severance expense  total noninterest expense was up  or 
merchant bankcard processing expense accounted for of the remaining increase and was directly related to the sales volume increase discussed in the noninterest revenue section of this report 
excluding the one time executive severance and the increase in merchant processing expense  total noninterest expense was up 
total personnel expense for was up over  primarily due to the executive severance expense of excluding executive severance expense  personnel expense increased or 
an increase of in employee salaries and commissions paid on residential mortgage originations was offset by a decline in company wide incentive based compensation 
other noninterest expense categories that showed material changes include equipment expense  professional services  and other data processing expense 
equipment expense was up or due to increased depreciation and maintenance costs related to new technology investments made during the fourth quarter professional services were for the year compared to  an increase of or 
this increase reflects higher legal fees during related to the increase in problem loans 
other data processing expense increased or resulting primarily from increased on line banking expense due to the growth in the client base and transaction volume 

table of contents compared to year to date noninterest expense of  was up or over last year 
bankcard processing fees increased or directly related to the revenue increase and increased volumes and accounted for of the total expense increase 
excluding bankcard processing fees  all other noninterest expense grew by or 
salaries and employee benefits rose or due to salary increases of existing staff  increased commissions to mortgage loan originators  and higher benefit costs 
expense increases in bankcard processing and salaries were offset by a decline in business development expense and a decline in other expense 
the decline in the other expense category resulted from an drop in repossession expense and a decrease of in nasdaq listing fees 
liquidity liquidity is the term used to define the company s ability to meet its financial commitments 
the company maintains sufficient liquidity to ensure funds are available for both lending needs and the withdrawal of deposit funds 
the company derives liquidity primarily through core deposit growth  maturity of investment securities  and loan payments 
core deposits include demand  interest checking  money market  savings  and local time deposits 
additional liquidity and funding sources are provided through the sale of loans  sales of securities  access to national cd markets  and both secured and unsecured borrowings 
core deposits at december  were of total deposits  compared to at december  during  the company experienced a  or increase in its core deposit base 
nearly  of the growth in core deposits occurred in noninterest bearing deposits 
the company used this core deposit growth  sales and maturities of securities  and growth in national and public time deposits to fund asset growth during the year 
because of seasonal construction and economic activity and client payment of various tax obligations  the company traditionally experiences a decline in core deposits during the first quarter of the year typically resulting in funding and liquidity pressures 
the company expects to sell loans during the first quarter in anticipation of the projected decline in core deposits 
in addition  the company has deposit relationship with a single client representing of total core deposits 
the loss of this deposit relationship could cause an adverse effect on short term liquidity 
the company expects to maintain this relationship and believes it has sufficient sources of liquidity to mitigate this concentration 
overnight unsecured borrowing lines have been established at various correspondent banks  the federal home loan bank of seattle and with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
at year end december   the bank had overnight borrowing lines totaling approximately  at december   the company had approximately  of overnight funding available 
in addition   of funding was available from the state of oregon time deposit program with community banks and a  secured overnight borrowing line with the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
the company s loan portfolio also contains approximately  in guaranteed government loans  which can be sold on the secondary market 
capital resources capital is the shareholder s investment in the company 
capital grows through the retention of earnings and the issuance of new stock through the exercise of incentive options 
capital formation allows the company to grow assets and provides flexibility in times of adversity 
banking regulations require the company to maintain minimum levels of capital 
the company manages its capital to maintain a well capitalized designation the fdic s highest rating 
at december   the company s total capital to risk weighted assets was  compared to at december  
table of contents during the fourth quarter  the company announced a share repurchase plan  which allows the company to repurchase  shares or approximately of outstanding shares through december  through december   the company repurchased a total of  shares   during the fourth quarter and  during the company did not repurchase any shares during the last half at december   the company does not have a share repurchase plan in place 
during the first quarter  the company announced the decision to change its practice of declaring semiannual cash dividends  and instead implemented a practice of paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis as discussed in part ii  item  market for company s common equity and related stockholder matters included in this report 
during  the company has declared and paid four quarterly cash dividends of or per share for the year 
that compares to cash dividends of paid during the company projects that earnings retention and existing capital will be sufficient to fund anticipated asset growth  while maintaining a well capitalized designation from the fdic 
inflation substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
therefore  inflation has a less significant impact on the company than does fluctuation in market interest rates 
inflation can lead to accelerated growth in noninterest expenses  which impacts net earnings 
during the last two years  inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  has not changed significantly 
the effects of this inflation have not had a material impact on the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s results of operations are largely dependent upon its ability to manage market risks 
changes in interest rates can have a significant effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not use derivatives such as forward and futures contracts  options  or interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
other types of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
interest rate risk generally arises when the maturity or repricing structure of the company s assets and liabilities differ significantly 
asset and liability management  which among other things addresses such risk  is the process of developing  testing and implementing strategies that seek to maximize net interest income while maintaining sufficient liquidity 
this process includes monitoring contractual maturity and prepayment expectations together with expected repricing of assets and liabilities under different interest rate scenarios 
generally  the company seeks a structure that insulates net interest income from large deviations attributable to changes in market rates 
interest rate risk is managed through the monitoring of the company s balance sheet by subjecting various asset and liability categories to interest rate shocks and gradual interest rate movements over a one year period of time 
interest rate shocks use an instantaneous adjustment in market rates of large magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in interest rates would have on the company s net interest income and capital for the succeeding twelve month period 
such an extreme change in interest rates and the assumption that management would take no steps to restructure the balance sheet does limit the usefulness of this type of analysis 
this type of analysis tends to provide a best case or worst case scenario 
a more reasonable approach utilizes gradual interest rate movements over a one year period of time to determine the effect on the company s net interest income 
the company utilizes the services of the federal home loan bank s asset liability modeling software to determine the effect changes in interest rates have on net interest income 
interest rate shock scenarios are modeled in increments plus or minus in the federal funds rate 
the more realistic forecast assumes a gradual interest rate movement of plus or minus change in the federal funds rate over a one year period of 
table of contents time with rates moving up or down each quarter 
the model used is based on the concept that all rates do not move by the same amount 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar repricing characteristics  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits would likely deviate from those previously assumed 
increases in market rates may also affect the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled principal payments 
the model attempts to account for such limitations by imposing weights on the differences between repricing assets and repricing liabilities within each time segment 
these weights are based on the ratio between the amount of rate change of each category of asset or liability  and the amount of change in the federal funds rate 
certain non maturing liabilities such as checking accounts and money market deposit accounts are allocated among the various repricing time segments to meet local competitive conditions and management s strategies 
the company strives to manage the balance sheet so that net interest income is not negatively impacted more than given a change in interest rates of plus or minus basis points 
evaluations of the forecasting model at december  indicate the company is within its established guidelines 
during  the model has shown the company is becoming more asset sensitive and projects declining margins in a falling rate environment 
this is due to the inability of the company to reprice a large portion of its interest bearing core deposits  which are at a practical floor at december  during  in the current interest rate environment  the company expects net interest margin to decline as loans with active interest rate floors renew at current market rates and new loans are originated at low rates  which will cause earning asset yields  while the cost of interest bearing deposits will remain stable 
the following tables show the estimated impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
tables show results of company supplied data for both the rate shock and gradual interest rate scenarios 
the base figure of  used in both analyses represents actual net interest income for the year due to the various assumptions used for this modeling  no assurance can be given that projections will reflect actual results
