utility operations electric the company provides jurisdictional retail electric service to a large area of north central new mexico  including the coa and the city of santa fe  and certain other areas of new mexico 
the largest retail electric customer served by the company accounted for approximately of the company s total retail electric revenues for the year ended december  for the years through  retail kwh sales have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 
the company s system peak demands for its retail customers and firm requirements customers in summer and winter for the last three years are shown in the following table system peak demands megawatts summer    winter    the company holds long term  non exclusive franchise agreements for its electric retail operations  expiring between may and november these franchise agreements provide the company access to public rights of way for placement of the company s electric facilities 
the coa  city of santa fe  town of cochiti lake  bernalillo county  luna county  sandoval county  san miguel county  village of bosque farms  pueblo de cochiti and village of tijeras franchises have expired 
the coa metropolitan area accounted for approximately of the company s total electric utility operating revenues  and no other franchise area represents more than approximately 
the company continues to collect and pay franchise fees to the coa  city of santa fe  the town of cochiti lake  village of bosque farms and village of tijeras 
the company currently does not pay franchise fees to bernalillo county  luna county  sandoval county and san miguel county 
the company remains obligated under new mexico state law to provide service to customers in these franchise areas even in the absence of a franchise agreement 
electric procures all of its electric power needs from generation and marketing operations 
these intersegment sales are priced using internally developed transfer pricing and are not based on market rates 
customer electric rates are regulated by the prc and determined on a basis that includes the recovery of the cost of power production by generation and marketing operations and a return on the related assets 
the company owns or leases  circuit miles of transmission lines  interconnected with other utilities in new mexico  east and south into texas  west into arizona  and north into colorado and utah 
due to rapid load growth in the company s service territory in recent years and the lack of transmission development  most of the capacity on this transmission system is fully committed and there is very little or no additional access available on a firm commitment basis 
these factors result in physical constraints on the system and limit the ability to wheel power into the company s service area from outside new mexico 
gas gas operations distributes natural gas to most of the major communities in new mexico  including the coa and the city of santa fe 
the coa metropolitan area accounted for approximately of the total gas revenues in no single sales service customer accounted for more than approximately of the company s therm sales in the company holds long term  non exclusive franchises with varying expiration dates in all incorporated communities requiring franchise agreements except for the coa  city of santa fe  aztec  village of bosque farms  town of cochiti lake  los ranchos de albuquerque and tatum 
the company remains obligated to serve these franchise areas pursuant to state law even in the absence of a franchise agreement 
the company s customer base includes both sales service customers and transportation service customers 
sales service customers purchase natural gas and receive transportation and delivery services from the company for which the company receives both cost of gas and cost of service revenues 
cost of gas revenues collected from on system sales service customers are recovered in accordance with prc regulations and represent a pass through of the company s cost of natural gas to the customer 
since the company obtains its natural gas supply on the open market from non affiliated third party producers  the company s operating results are not affected by an increase or decrease in natural gas prices 
additionally  the company makes occasional gas sales to off system customers 
off system sales deliveries generally occur at interstate pipeline interconnects with the company s system 
transportation service customers  who procure gas independently of the company and contract with the company for transportation and related services  provide the company with cost of service revenues only 
transportation services are provided to gas marketers  producers and end users for delivery to locations throughout its distribution systems  as well as for delivery to interstate pipelines 
the company provided gas transportation deliveries to approximately  gas marketers  producers and end users during during  approximately of the company s total gas throughput was related to transportation gas deliveries 
the company s transportation rates are unbundled  and transportation customers only pay for the service they receive 
cost of gas revenues  received from sales service and off system customers  and other pgac related revenues accounted for approximately of the company s total gas operating revenues in since a major portion of the company s load is related to heating  levels of therm sales are affected by weather 
approximately of the company s total therm sales in occurred in the months of january  february  march and december 
the company obtains its supply of natural gas primarily from sources within new mexico by contracting with third party producers and marketers 
these contracts are generally sufficient to meet the company s peak day demand 
the company serves certain cities which depend on epng or transwestern pipeline company for transportation of gas supplies 
because these cities are not directly connected to the company s transmission facilities  gas transported by these companies is the sole supply source for those cities 
such transportation is regulated by ferc 
as a result of ferc order  the company s options for transporting gas to these cities and other portions of its distribution system have increased 
generation and marketing operations the company s generation and marketing operations serve four principal markets 
sales to the company s utility operations to cover jurisdictional electric demand and sales to firm requirements wholesale customers comprise two of these markets 
intersegment sales to the utility operations are priced using internally developed transfer pricing and are not based on market rates 
the third market consists of other contracted sales to third parties for which generation and marketing operations commit to deliver a specified amount of capacity measured in megawatts mw or energy measured in megawatt hours mwh over a given period of time 
the fourth market consists of energy sales from excess capacity made on an hourly basis at fluctuating  spot market rates 
these sales include the company s wholesale power marketing activities 
the company is connected to the western area power grid  which includes california and the surrounding states  and therefore its wholesale power sales are into this market 
the western united states wholesale power market in and was  and continues to be  extremely volatile due to a power supply shortage and other constraints 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other issues facing the company western united states wholesale power market 
power sales a significantly larger portion of the company s earnings in and was derived from its wholesale electric sales than in however  in the last half of  the wholesale power market in the western united states became extremely volatile and  while providing many marketing opportunities  presented and continues to present significant risk to companies selling power into this marketplace 
in  the company s revenues from this marketplace declined significantly as a result of a slowdown in the wholesale market 
the company has been successful  however  in developing its wholesale power marketing activities in the western united states 
management believes this success is due to its niche business strategy of providing electric power customized to meet the special needs of its customers 
this niche marketing strategy is based on the company s asset backed methodology whereby the company s net open position is always supported by its generation capacity excluded from its retail rates  or by the availability of power not needed to serve its retail customers 
this asset backed methodology helps to mitigate the risks inherent in the company s wholesale power marketing activities 
the company also utilizes long term transactions to enhance its product offering 
certain company generation assets are excluded from retail electric rates 
in  the nmpuc excluded mw of sjgs unit and all of pvngs unit as a result  the company developed a wholesale power marketing operation to sell the generation from its excluded assets that no longer generated a return in rate base 
these activities include the forward purchase and sale of electricity to take advantage of market price opportunities in the electric wholesale market 
during  and  the company s sales in the wholesale electric markets accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of its total mwh sales 
of the total wholesale electric sales made in  and   and  respectively were transacted through purchases for resale 
in  the nmpuc established a wholesale electric sales methodology that provided for fixed rate paths within its jurisdiction for predetermined periods with wholesale electric sales accruing to the benefit of shareholders 
subsequent rate cases continued to utilize this methodology 
in setting these periodic fixed rate paths  pnm has been able to reduce its jurisdictional electric customers rates by over million since on january   the prc approved the global electric agreement which sets a rate path through pnm will decrease retail electric rates in two phases over the next three years 
the first phase of the rate reductions become effective in september in addition  certain plant and purchased power contracts previously excluded from retail rates are now included as generation resources to serve pnm s new mexico retail and firm wholesale requirements customers load 
these resources include san juan unit and pnm s contracts to purchase power from sps  tri state and delta 
pvngs unit remains excluded as are the recently operational lordsburg and afton plants 
see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other issues facing the company merchant plant filing and electric rate settlement 
the generation and marketing strategy calls for increased asset backed marketing and generation capacity supported by long term contracts  balanced with stringent risk management policies 
the company s future growth plans call for approximately of its new generation portfolio to be committed through long term contracts  including sales to retail customers 
growth will be dependent on market development  and upon the company s ability to generate funds for the company s future expansion 
although the current environment has led the company to scale back its expansion plans  the company will continue to operate in the wholesale market 
expansion of the company s generating portfolio will depend upon acquiring favorably priced assets at strategic locations and securing long term commitments for the purchase of power from the acquired plants 
the company has entered into various firm wholesale electric sales contracts 
these contracts contain fixed capacity charges in addition to energy charges 
the appa contract requires appa to purchase varying amounts of power from the company through may and allows appa to make adjustments to the purchase amounts subject to certain notice provisions 
for  appa invoked its option to increase its peak demand to mw 
the appa demand dropped to mw in june the company furnished firm requirements wholesale power in new mexico in to the city of gallup 
the company is committed to provide service to the city of gallup through june average monthly demands under the city of gallup contract for were approximately mw 
beginning july  the company began serving navopache electric cooperative firm requirements service under the provisions of a year contract 
average monthly demand for navopache is mw 
the company began serving a partial requirements contract with the texas new mexico power company in july for mw 
the contract service dropped to mw in  then became a firm requirements contract in january and continues through beginning march   the company began servicing wapa for approximately mw of electric power that will be wheeled to serve kafb 
the company s firm requirements demand is expected to be mw in  mw in  mw in  mw in and mw in no firm requirements wholesale customer accounted for more than of the company s total electric sales for resale revenues for the year ended december  sources of power as of december   the total net generation capacity of facilities owned or leased by the company was  mw  excluding the operating lease discussed below which would bring the total to  mw 
the company is committed to increasing its utilization of its major generation capacity at sjgs  four corners and pvngs 
sjgs is operated by the company 
sjgs s equivalent availability and capacity factor were and respectively  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to and  respectively for capacity factors for four corners and pvngs were and  respectively  in  as compared to and  respectively  in four corners and pvngs are operated by aps 
see item properties 
pnm committed to purchase five combustion turbines for a total cost of million 
the turbines are for planned power generation plants with an estimated cost of construction of approximately million over the next five years depending on market conditions 
pnm has expended million for construction as of december  of which million was for equipment purchases 
on june   lordsburg  an mw natural gas fired plant became fully operational and commenced serving the wholesale power market 
afton  a mw simple cycle gas turbine  became fully operational on december  these plants are part of the company s ongoing competitive strategy of increasing generation capacity over time to serve increasing retail load  sales under long term contracts and other sales 
these plants were not built to serve new mexico retail customers and therefore are not currently  included in the rate base 
however  it is possible that these plants may be needed in the future to serve the growing retail load 
if so  these plants will have to be certified by the prc and would then be included in the rate base 
in addition to generating its own power  the company purchases power in the market 
the company has a power purchase contract with sps which originally provided for the purchase of up to mw per year and expires in may the company may reduce its purchases from sps by mw annually upon three years notice 
the company provided notice to reduce the purchase by mw in and by an additional mw in the company also is party to a master power purchase and sale agreement with sps  dated august   pursuant to which the company has agreed to purchase mw of firm power from sps from through in addition  the company has mw of contingent capacity obtained from el paso under a transmission capacity for generation capacity trade arrangement through september beginning october and continuing through june  the capacity amount will be mw 
the company has a ppa with tri state for mw through june  in addition  the company is interconnected with various utilities for economy interchanges and mutual assistance in emergencies 
in  the company entered into an operating lease agreement for the rights to all the output of the delta gas fired generating plant for years 
the plant received ferc approval for exempt wholesale generator status 
the maximum dependable capacity under the lease is mw 
in july  the plant went into operation 
the gas turbine generating unit is operated by delta and is located on the company s retired person generating station site in the coa 
the site for the generating unit was chosen  in part  to provide needed benefits to the company s constrained transmission system 
primary fuel for the gas turbine generating unit is natural gas provided by the company s gas operations 
in addition  the unit has the capability to utilize low sulfur fuel oil if natural gas is neither available nor cost effective 
on october   pnm entered into an agreement with fpl energy llc fpl  a subsidiary of fpl group  inc  to develop a mw wind generation facility in new mexico 
fpl will build  own and operate the new mexico wind energy center nmwe  consisting of wind powered turbines on a site in eastern new mexico 
pnm will buy all the power generated by the nmwe under a year contract 
construction of the wind energy site began in january construction on a facility of this size typically takes six to nine months to complete 
pnm will ask the prc to approve a voluntary tariff that would allow pnm retail customers to buy wind generated electricity for a small monthly premium 
power from the facility not subscribed by pnm retail customers under the voluntary program would be sold on the wholesale market  either within new mexico or outside the state 
fuel and water supply the percentages of the company s generation of electricity on the basis of kwh fueled by coal  nuclear fuel and gas and oil  and the average costs to the company of those fuels in cents per million btu  during the past three years were as follows coal nuclear gas and oil percent of average percent of average percent of average generation cost generation cost generation cost the estimated generation mix for is coal  nuclear and gas and oil 
due to locally available natural gas and oil supplies  the utilization of locally available coal deposits and the generally abundant supply of nuclear fuel  the company believes that adequate sources of fuel are available for its generating stations into the foreseeable future 
coal the coal requirements for the sjgs are being supplied by sjcc  a wholly owned subsidiary of bhp billiton  which holds certain federal  state and private coal leases under a coal sales agreement pursuant to which sjcc will supply processed coal for operation of the sjgs until bhp minerals international  inc has guaranteed the obligations of sjcc under the agreement  which contemplates the delivery of approximately million tons of coal during its remaining term 
that amount would supply substantially all the requirements of the sjgs through approximately in august  the company and tucson signed an agreement with sjcc to replace two surface mining operations with a single underground mine located adjacent to the plant 
underground mining is expected to provide a higher quality coal at a lower cost per ton 
the new mine will use the longwall mining technique and is expected to ramp to full station supply by the end of the first quarter the revised coal contract  entered into as a result of the move to an underground mine  is expected to save the company between million and million in base fuel cost reductions and avoided coal cost increases over the next years 
besides saving on fuel costs  the cleaner burning  less abrasive coal is expected to reduce the plant s maintenance and operating expenses 
the plant is expected to realize some of the benefits of the higher quality coal in  as the existing surface mines are phased out and the underground mine is brought to full capacity 
four corners is supplied with coal under a fuel agreement between the owners and bncc  under which bncc agreed to supply all the coal requirements for the life of the plant 
the current fuel agreement expires december  negotiations for an extension have been initiated 
bncc holds a long term coal mining lease  with options for renewal  from the navajo nation and operates a surface mine adjacent to four corners with the coal supply expected to be sufficient to supply the units for their estimated useful lives 
natural gas the natural gas used as fuel for the electric generating plant located in coa reeves station and the delta operating lease is delivered by gas 
the company s generation and marketing operations procures its gas supply independently of gas and contracting with the utility operations for transportation services only 
nuclear fuel the fuel cycle for pvngs is comprised of the following stages o the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates  o the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride  o the enrichment of uranium hexafluoride  o the fabrication of fuel assemblies  o the utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors  and o the storage and disposal of spent fuel 
the pvngs participants have contracted for uranium concentrates that will meet of requirements for and of requirements for through conversion services contracts  the pvngs participants have arranged for uranium conversion services that will meet of requirements for and of requirements for the pvngs participants have an enrichment services contract that provides of requirements for and of requirements for the pvngs participants have a new enriched uranium product eup contract that will furnish of pvngs requirements for uranium  conversion services  and enrichment services for and up to of those requirements from through this contract could also provide of enrichment services in and in addition  existing contracts will provide of fuel assembly fabrication services until at least for each pvngs unit 
water supply water for sjgs and four corners is obtained from the san juan river 
see item legal proceedings san juan river adjudication 
the company and tucson have a contract with the usbr usbr contract for consumption of  acre feet of water per year for sjgs 
the contract expires in in  the company signed a twenty two year contract with jicarilla  beginning in  for the full  acre feet of water from the jicarilla supply in navajo reservoir jicarilla contract that will replace the contract expiring in the jicarilla contract is essentially equivalent to a renewed usbr contract  the only material difference being that jicarilla  as opposed to usbr  would be the contract supplier 
jicarilla has contract water in navajo reservoir pursuant to a water rights settlement approved by congress in and a judicial decree that was entered february  the contract has received all requisite approvals 
in addition  the company was granted the authority to consume  acre feet of water per year under a state permit that is held by bncc 
bncc also has committed a portion of those rights to four corners through the life of the plant 
sewage effluent used for cooling purposes in the operation of the pvngs units is obtained under contracts with certain municipalities in the area 
the contracted quantity of effluent exceeds the amount required for the three pvngs units 
the validity of these effluent contracts is the subject of litigation in state court 
see item legal proceedings pvngs water supply litigation 
the four corners region  in which sjgs and four corners are located  has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants in  as well as later years if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area 
usbr is working to assess the adequacy of the water supply under pnm s usbr contract for  acre feet of water that supplies sjgs 
additionally  various stakeholders in the san juan basin  including the new mexico state engineer  are evaluating the water rights that might be affected by the drought conditions  including water rights pursuant to the new mexico state permit that provide  acre feet of water to sjgs and approximately  acre feet of water to four corners 
pnm is assessing alternatives for temporary supplies of water and is working with usbr and area stakeholders to minimize the effect  if any  on operations of the plants 
pnm has assessed its situation with regard to the drought and the alternatives available to it and does not believe that its operations will be materially affected at this time 
however  pnm cannot forecast the weather situation and its ramifications with any degree of certainty or how regulators and legislators may impact pnm s situation in the future  should the drought continue 
unregulated operations the company s wholly owned subsidiary  avistar  was formed in august as a new mexico corporation and is currently engaged in certain unregulated  non utility business ventures 
in july  the board of directors of avistar decided to wind down operations except for avistar s reliadigm business unit  which provides maintenance and productivity improvement solutions to the electric power industry 
avistar had previously divested itself of its energy partners business unit and liquidated axon field services and pathways integration 
in addition  the transfer of operation of the sangre de cristo water company to the city of santa fe was completed in the third quarter of all remaining non reliadigm investments were written off with the exception of a portion of avistar s investment in nth power  an energy venture capital fund 
the company recorded charges of million to reflect these activities and the impairment of its avistar investments in rates and regulation pnm is subject to the jurisdiction of the prc  the successor of the nmpuc effective january   with respect to its retail electric and gas rates  service  accounting  issuance of securities  construction of major new generation and transmission facilities and other matters regarding retail utility services provided in new mexico 
the ferc has jurisdiction over rates and other matters related to wholesale electric sales and cost recovery of its transmission network 
the ferc has begun to take more aggressive action with regard to the exercise of its jurisdictional authority over wholesale electric sales 
in february  in response in part to the allegations of wrong doing in the california spot market  the ferc announced it was establishing the office of market oversight and investigations omoi as the third prong of its strategic plan 
the stated purpose of the ferc omoi is to engage in the vigilant oversight of energy markets to ensure effective regulation and remediation of market problems  while vigorously enforcing compliance with the ferc s rules and regulations 
the ferc has moved forward to staff its omoi and it is now a fully functioning branch of the ferc

ferc mandated regional transmission organizations with the passage of the public utility regulatory policies act of and the energy policy act of  there has been a significant increase in the level of competition in the market for the generation and sale of electricity 
barriers have been reduced for companies wishing to build  own and operate electric generating facilities 
in  the ferc issued order requiring electric utilities controlling transmission facilities to file open access transmission tariffs  which opened the utility transmission systems to wholesale sellers and buyers of electric energy on a non discriminatory basis 
order also encouraged utilities to investigate the formation of independent system operators isos to operate transmission assets and provided guidance for the formation  operation and governance of isos 
in  the ferc issued order on regional transmission organizations rtos  which established timelines for transmission owning entities to join an rto and defined the minimum characteristics and functions of an rto 
the company  along with other regional transmission owners tos  originally pursued the formation of an rto through desert star  a non profit organization 
because of the ferc s subsequent acceptance of a for profit rto model and because a for profit rto was viewed as having the proper motivation to efficiently facilitate competitive markets  the company and the to s formed westconnect rto  llc westconnect  a for profit transmission company 
on october   westconnect filed its complete rto package with ferc requesting a declaratory order confirming the westconnect filing satisfies the ferc order requirements 
there were over intervenors in the westconnect docket  including the new mexico attorney general  new mexico industrial energy consumers and the prc  which filed comments or concerns regarding westconnect s declaratory order petition 
westconnect filed a response to the intervenors concerns on december  on october   the ferc issued its declaratory order in the case providing guidance and conditions under which the proposal for formation of the westconnect rto would be deemed to satisfy the ferc s requirements for rto status under its order several parties to the proceeding  including pnm as a proposed member of westconnect  filed motions for rehearing and clarification of the ferc s declaratory order 
on december   the ferc issued its order granting in part and denying in part the requests for rehearing and provided clarification on certain issues raised by the parties in the case 
this order on rehearing provided for certain filings that need to be made by westconnect s proposed participants in order to move westconnect forward towards rto status 
pnm is currently evaluating the requirements of the ferc s order on rehearing 
uncertainty exists regarding the ferc s evolving rto policy 
westconnect is participating in various workshops and rulemakings before the ferc and is pursuing avenues to expand its scope so as to enhance its chances for approval as one of the rtos in the west 
el paso electric afton generating station matter with the company s construction of afton  pnm representatives have been engaged in a ferc proceeding with el paso to obtain transmission capacity on el paso s transmission system to transmit mw of power generated at afton north to serve certain load needs on pnm s system in the coa area 
to date  el paso has executed an agreement to transmit only mw of power on a firm service basis  and offered to supply an additional mw of contingent transmission service 
on october   at pnm s request in the ferc proceeding  el paso filed with the ferc its unexecuted transportation agreements to provide mw of contingent transmission service to pnm 
on november   pnm filed its protests with ferc challenging el paso s denial of pnm s request for the full mw of transmission service 
in an order issued by ferc on december   ferc ordered the matter to be set for hearing 
the ferc has set the hearing in this matter for july  pnm will participate fully in this matter and aggressively pursue its rights 
pnm cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding 
rulemakings over the past year  ferc has issued numerous rulemakings 
the company is following the rulemakings and will submit its comments or will comment in conjunction with the edison electric institute eei 
the westconnect members are also following  attending workshops and commenting on the rulemakings  which affect the member companies  including pnm 
the rulemaking of particular interest to pnm include the standard market design smd rule  in which the ferc is attempting to remedy what it sees as undue discrimination in the provision of interstate transmission services  and to ensure just and reasonable rates for electric energy within and among regional power markets 
the proposed rule would put all transmission customers  including bundled retail customers  under new pro forma transmission rates for new transmission service 
all transmission will be operated under independent transmission providers including rtos and congestion management will be handled under locational marginal pricing with tradable congestion revenue rights 
pnm plans to submit comments on the smd nopr along with other westconnect companies and will continue to participate in the rulemaking process 
other rulemakings that pnm is participating in and in which it has filed comments  either alone or in conjunction with the westconnect participants  include o standardizing generation interconnection agreements and procedures  o standards of conduct for transmission providers  and o standards for business practices of interstate natural gas pipelines 
prc transmission investigation in july  the ag filed a petition requesting that the prc initiate an investigation of electric transmission issues including ferc versus prc jurisdiction and the effect of rto formation on prc jurisdiction 
the company suggested workshops to inform the prc and other interested parties on the issues 
the prc held workshops for three days  and subsequently issued an order requiring that the company and other transmission owning entities in the proceeding file comments on jurisdictional issues 
pnm and other new mexico jurisdictional utilities filed their comments 
subsequently  on december   the ag filed another motion in the case requesting that the new mexico jurisdictional utilities file updated comments and provide a status on their participation and activities related to the establishment of rtos  and requested the prc to issue an order establishing a moratorium on the filing of applications seeking approval for participation in an rto until may  pnm filed its response on december   suggesting that additional workshops be held to provide stakeholders with an update on rto participation and activities  and that it did not object to a moratorium on the filing of applications seeking approval for participation in rtos since it had no current plans to make such a filing before may the prc has not yet issued an order in response to the ag s motion 
on december   sps filed an application at the prc requesting approval of its participation in the translink rto 
pnm has intervened in this proceeding and plans to fully participate in it 
renewable resources rulemakings on may   the prc issued a notice of inquiry seeking input as to the need for a rule to encourage the development of renewable energy in new mexico 
rule  includes a provision requiring the use of a minimum of renewable energy by january   with the minimum amount to increase per year for each year until a renewable portfolio standard of is reached in the year rule also provides that each kilowatt of electricity generated by solar technology will count as three kwhs and each kilowatt hour generated by bio mass  geothermal landfill gas  or fuel cell sources will count as two kwhs 
all remaining sources of renewable energy  including wind and hydroelectronic technologies  will count as one kwh for each kw generated 
on january   the company filed a request for rehearing asking the prc to reconsider its final order 
by order issued february   the prc denied all requests for rehearing 
pnm is considering the possibility of filing an appeal with the new mexico supreme court seeking to reverse the final order 
the new mexico legislature is considering legislation that might impact rule in its present form  rule could significantly change the make up of pnm s energy supply portfolio 
the company is unable to predict the outcome of this rulemaking proceeding 
gas rates and regulation gas rate case on january   pnm filed a gas general rate case  which asks the prc to approve an increase in the service fees charged to its  natural gas customers 
the proposal would increase both the set monthly service fee and the charge tied to monthly usage 
those fees are separate from the cost of gas charged to customers 
the monthly cost of gas charge would not be affected by the fee increase as discussed below 
the proposed cost of service rate increase of million is designed to provide pnm s gas utility an opportunity to earn a percent return on equity  which is consistent with the return allowed comparable natural gas utilities 
pnm s current return on equity from its gas business is below 
a hearing of the case is anticipated to begin the last week of june purchase gas adjustment clause the company s retail gas rate tariffs contain a pgac that provides timely recovery for the cost of gas purchased for resale to its sales service customers 
in  the company presented workshops to the prc  advocating that the pgac balancing account be reconciled on a monthly basis  rather than annually 
the company also requested that it be allowed to earn a return on the balancing account balance 
a final order was issued in july that approves an agreement among the parties regarding the company s hedging strategy and the implementation of a price management fund program which includes a continuous monthly balancing account adjustment factor with a carrying charge set at the pre tax cost of capital approved by the prc in the company s last gas rate proceeding 
this carrying charge has the effect of keeping the company whole on gas purchase transactions since it is now compensated for the time value of money 
discounted transportation fee recovery the company made a request to begin the recovery of discounted transportation fee amounts from sales and transportation customers 
discounted transportation fee recovery is a holdover issue from the new mexico supreme court s ruling that the amounts passing the prc s cost benefit test were collectible and leaving open only the issue of allocation between customers 
the discounts passing the prc s cost benefit test total million 
a hearing date of april  has been set 
notice of inquiry on pipeline safety in may  the prc issued a notice of inquiry into whether the prc should consider adopting new rules  including quality of service standards  to protect the public health and safety  public and private property  and the environment by ensuring the integrity of pipeline systems 
the prc requested information from all pipeline operators with underground or above ground facilities in the state 
the company submitted its comments and participated in the hearings in this inquiry 
subsequent prc action is pending 
el paso gas capacity allocation matter in an order issued by ferc on may   as supplemented by an order issued on september   the ferc mandated that all full requirements customers on epng s transmission system  including pnm  convert from their current full requirements natural gas transportation service to contract demand transportation service by november  under this new type of service  pnm would be allocated a certain level of transportation capacity on epng s transmission system at certain designated receipt points 
several parties have filed petitions for rehearing requesting that ferc reconsider its order requiring the change over in transportation service 
the ferc has subsequently delayed implementing the conversion to contract demand transportation service until may  on december   epng filed its proposed capacity allocation report wherein  it purported to assign contract demand capacity at certain receipt points along its system  as well as reallocate costs among full requirements customers 
on january   pnm filed comments to epng s report objecting to epng s proposed reallocation of costs 
epng s converting customers are engaged in ongoing negotiations regarding the reallocated capacity available for converting shippers and the appropriate cost reallocation methodology 
the costs pnm incurs for obtaining natural gas transportation services are flowed through in the transportation component of rates charged to retail natural gas customers 
pnm is participating in this matter fully to protect its rights  and cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding 
environmental matters the company  in common with other electric and gas utilities  is subject to stringent laws and regulations for protection of the environment by local  state  federal and tribal authorities 
in addition  pvngs is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc  which has authority to issue permits and licenses and to regulate nuclear facilities in order to protect the health and safety of the public from radioactive hazards and to conduct environmental reviews pursuant to the national environmental policy act

the final rule calls for all states to establish goals and emission reduction strategies for improving visibility in all the class areas 
the company cannot predict at this time what the impact of the implementation of the regional haze rule will be on the company s coal fired power plant operations 
potentially  additional so emission reductions could be required in the timeframe 
the nature and cost of compliance with these potential requirements cannot be determined at this time 
however  the company does not anticipate any material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
person station the company  in compliance with a corrective action directive issued by the nmed  determined that groundwater contamination exists in the deep and shallow groundwater at the company s person station site 
the company is required to delineate the extent of the contamination and remediate the contaminants in the groundwater at the person station site 
the extent of shallow and deep groundwater contamination was assessed and the results were reported to the nmed 
the company has received the renewal of the rcra post closure care permit for the facility 
remedial actions for the shallow and deep groundwater were incorporated into the new permit 
the company has installed and is operating a pump and treatment system for the shallow groundwater 
the renewed rcra post closure care permit allows remediation of the deep groundwater contamination through natural attenuation 
the company s current estimate to decommission its retired fossil fueled plants discussed below includes approximately million in additional expenses to complete the groundwater remediation program at person station 
the remediation program continues on schedule 
retired fossil fueled plant decommissioning costs the company s retired fossil fueled generating stations  person  prager and santa fe stations  have incurred dismantling and reclamation costs as they are decommissioned 
the company s share of decommissioning costs for these fossil fueled generating stations is projected to be approximately million stated in dollars of which million has already been expended

pnm also owns mw of net rated capacity derived from its interest in units and of four corners located in northwestern new mexico on land leased from the navajo nation and adjacent to available coal deposits 
units and at four corners are jointly owned with sce  aps  salt river project  tucson and el paso and are operated by aps 
four corners and a portion of the facilities adjacent to sjgs are located on land held under easements from the united states and also under leases from the navajo nation 
the enforcement of these leases could require congressional consent 
the company does not deem the risk with respect to the enforcement of these easements and leases to be material 
however  the company is dependent in some measure upon the willingness and ability of the navajo nation to protect these properties 
the company owns mw of generation capacity at reeves station in coa and mw of generation capacity at las vegas station in las vegas  new mexico 
during  the company added afton  a mw gas or oil fired combustion turbine plant in la mesa  new mexico  and lordsburg  an mw of gas fired combustion turbine generator in lordsburg  new mexico 
in addition  the company has mw of generation capacity in coa under an operating lease 
these power sources are used primarily for peaking and transmission support 
during times of excess capacity  resources have been used to augment the company s wholesale power trading activities 
nuclear plant the company s interest in pvngs the company is participating in the three  mw units of pvngs  also known as the arizona nuclear power project  with aps the operating agent  salt river project  el paso  sce  scppa and the department of water and power of the city of los angeles 
the company has a undivided interest in pvngs  with portions of its interests in units and held under leases 
nuclear safety performance rating on pvngs in  the nrc began using a new  objective oversight process that is more focused on safety 
the new process includes objective performance thresholds based on insights from safety studies and years of plant operating experience in the united states 
it is more timely to move from the to month time lag of the previous oversight process for assessing plant performance to a quarterly review 
the nrc also hopes the process will be more accessible to  and readily understood by  the public 
in its most recent review  pvngs had all indicators green the best possible of the four indicator levels 
sale and leaseback transactions of pvngs units and in and  the company entered into a total of eleven sale and lease back transactions with owner trusts under which it sold and leased back its entire interest in pvngs units and  together with portions of the company s undivided interest in certain pvngs common facilities 
the leases under each of the sale and leaseback transactions have initial lease terms expiring january  with respect to the unit leases or january  with respect to the unit leases 
each of the leases allows the company to extend the term of the lease as well as includes a repurchase option 
the lease expense for the company s pvngs leases is approximately million per year 
throughout the terms of the leases  the company continues to have full and exclusive authority and responsibility to exercise and perform all of the rights and duties of a participant in pvngs under the arizona nuclear power project participation agreement and retains the exclusive right to sell and dispose of its share of the power and energy generated by pvngs units and the company also retains its responsibility to pay of its share of all taxes  insurance premiums  operating and maintenance costs  costs related to capital improvements and decommissioning and all other similar costs and expenses associated with the leased facilities 
in  the company purchased approximately of the beneficial interests in the pvngs units and leases through the purchase of ownership interest in the trusts which held the leases 
the related ownership interests were subsequently reacquired by the company when the company s trust ownership was collapsed and the company assumed direct ownership 
in connection with the million retail rate reduction approved by the nmpuc in  the company wrote down the purchased beneficial interests in pvngs units and leases to million 
each lease describes certain events  events of loss or deemed loss events  the occurrence of which could require the company to  among other things  i pay the lessor and the equity investor  in return for the investor s interest in pvngs  cash in the amount provided in the lease and ii assume debt obligations relating to the pvngs lease 
the events of loss generally relate to casualties  accidents and other events at pvngs  which would severely  adversely affect the ability of the operating agent  aps  to operate  and the ability of the company to earn a return on its interests in  pvngs 
the deemed loss events consist mostly of legal and regulatory changes such as changes in law making the sale and leaseback transactions illegal  or changes in law making the lessors liable for nuclear decommissioning obligations 
the company believes the probability of such events of loss or deemed loss events occurring is remote for the following reasons i to a large extent  prevention of events of loss and some deemed loss events is within the control of the pvngs participants  including the company  and the pvngs operating agent  through the general pvngs operational and safety oversight process and ii with respect to other deemed loss events  which would involve a significant change in current law and policy  the company is unaware of any pending proposals or proposals being considered for introduction in congress  or in any state legislative or regulatory body that  if adopted  would cause any such events

the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality  drinking water  and pesticide activities  including those that occur at four corners 
the four corners participants dispute that purported authority  and by letter dated october   the four corners participants requested the united states secretary of the interior to resolve their dispute with the navajo nation regarding whether or not the navajo acts apply to operations of four corners 
on october   the four corners participants filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation  window rock district  seeking  among other things  a declaratory judgment that o the lease and federal easement preclude the application of the navajo acts to the operations of four corners  and o the navajo nation and its agencies and courts lack adjudicatory jurisdiction to determine the enforceability of the navajo acts as applied to four corners

santa fe generating station santa fe station pnm and the nmed conducted investigations of the gasoline and chlorinated solvent groundwater contamination detected beneath pnm s former santa fe station site to determine the source of the contamination pursuant to a settlement agreement settlement agreement between pnm and the nmed 
no source of gasoline contamination in the groundwater was identified as originating from the site 
however  in june  pnm received a letter from the nmed  indicating that the nmed believed pnm is the source of gasoline contamination in a city of santa fe municipal supply well and in groundwater underlying the santa fe station site 
further  the nmed letter stated that pnm was required to proceed with interim remediation of the contamination pursuant to the new mexico water quality control commission regulations 
in october  pnm and the nmed signed an amendment to the settlement agreement concerning the groundwater contamination underlying the site 
as part of the amendment  pnm agreed to spend approximately million for certain costs related to sampling  monitoring and the development and implementation of a remediation plan with respect to gasoline contamination in the groundwater 
the amended settlement agreement does not  however  provide pnm with a full release from potential further liability for remediation of the gasoline contamination in the groundwater 
after pnm has expended the settlement amount  if the nmed can establish through binding arbitration that the santa fe station is the source of the contamination  pnm could be required to perform further remediation that is determined to be necessary 
pnm continues to dispute any contention that the santa fe station is the source of the gasoline contamination in the groundwater and believes that insufficient data exists to identify the source s of the groundwater contamination 
pnm s aquifer characterization and groundwater quality reports compiled from through strongly suggest groundwater contamination has been drawn under the site by the pumping of the santa fe supply well 
pnm and the nmed  with the cooperation of the city of santa fe  jointly selected a to year remediation plan proposed by a remediation contractor 
the city of santa fe  pnm and the nmed entered into a memorandum of understanding concerning the selected remediation plan and the operation of the municipal well adjacent to the santa fe station site in connection with carrying out the plan 
on october   a new system began operation to treat groundwater produced by the santa fe well to drinking water standards for municipal distribution and bioremediation of gasoline contamination beneath the santa fe station site 
since the reactivation of the santa fe well  the groundwater treatment and bioremediation systems have resulted in a marked reduction in contaminant concentrations at the wellhead 
however  contaminant concentrations at the property boundary remain high 
by letter dated august   pnm provided written notice to the nmed and the city of santa fe that pnm had satisfied its obligations with respect to the gasoline contamination under the amended settlement agreement  and pnm also stated its intention to cease operation  effective october   of the wellhead and bioremediation systems  and to discontinue monitoring and reporting with respect to gasoline contamination at the site 
the nmed responded with a written notice of determination dated august   stating that pnm is the responsible party for gasoline contamination at the site and requested that pnm refrain from cessation of operation of the remediation systems  monitoring and reporting 
in a meeting held on september   the nmed indicated its intention to file a court action seeking an order invalidating the binding arbitration provisions of the amended settlement agreement and a declaratory judgment that pnm is the responsible party for the gasoline contamination at the site 
pnm  the nmed and the city of santa fe have entered into a tolling agreement whereby the parties agreed to refrain from filing any actions or invoking the dispute resolution provisions under the settlement agreement pending further data review and negotiation with respect to the nmed s determination 
the tolling agreement expired on march  as part of the tolling agreement  pnm agreed to continue operation of the wellhead treatment system at the site and to continue well monitoring and reporting to the nmed through october  the company cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations with nmed 
former ag e manufactured gas plant site on december   pnm received a letter from the nmed notifying pnm that it had been designated as a responsible person under the new mexico water quality control abatement regulations 
pnm was directed to submit an abatement plan to investigate alleged contamination detected in the vicinity of a former manufactured gas plant mgp owned and operated by ag e in southeast albuquerque 
the contamination identified in the december letter was described as tar and volatile organic compounds 
pnm agreed to conduct voluntary abatement 
pnm submitted its voluntary stage abatement plan to the nmed on august  by letter dated november   the nmed conditionally approved pnm s voluntary stage abatement plan 
pnm submitted its voluntary stage abatement plan report report on october  the report confirmed the presence of soil contamination at the site resulting from the operations of the former mgp 
by letter dated december   the nmed approved the report and directed pnm to submit a voluntary stage abatement plan for corrective action at this site 
pnm submitted its voluntary stage abatement plan on november  and has selected a remedial alternative and contractor 
pnm is currently seeking approvals from regulatory and community groups for the proposed remedial alternative 
nmed has indicated that groundwater does not appear to have been impacted by the former mgp operations although groundwater beneath the site contains contaminants consistent with known upgradient diesel sources 
soils at the site contaminated with oil and tar like materials are proposed for excavation and disposal 
residual contaminants below feet will be capped

overview the holding company is an investor owned holding company of energy and energy related companies 
its principal subsidiary  pnm  is an integrated public utility primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale and marketing of electricity  transmission  distribution and sale of natural gas within the state of new mexico  and the sale and marketing of electricity in the western united states 
upon the completion on december  of a one for one share exchange between pnm and the holding company  the holding company became the parent company of pnm 
prior to the share exchange  the holding company had existed as a subsidiary of pnm 
the new parent company began trading on the new york stock exchange under the same pnm symbol beginning on december  competitive strategy the company is positioned as a merchant utility  primarily operating as a regulated energy service provider 
the company is also engaged in the sale and marketing of electricity in the competitive energy market place 
as a utility  pnm has an obligation to serve its customers under the jurisdiction of the prc 
as a merchant  pnm markets excess production from the utility  as well as unregulated generation  into a competitive marketplace 
the company also has an electric power marketing operation focused on purchasing wholesale electricity in the open market for future resale or to provide energy to jurisdictional customers in new mexico when the company s generation assets cannot satisfy demand 
the marketing operations utilize an asset backed marketing strategy  whereby the company s aggregate net open position for the sale of electricity is covered by the company s excess generation capabilities 
as it currently operates  the company s principal business segments are utility operations  which include electric services electric and gas services gas  and generation and marketing operations generation and marketing 
electric consists of two major business lines that include distribution and transmission 
the transmission business line does not meet the definition of a segment due to its immateriality and is combined with the distribution business line for disclosure purposes 
unregulated operations provide energy related services 
the electric and gas services strategy is directed at supplying reasonably priced and reliable energy to retail customers through customer driven operational excellence  high quality customer service  cost efficient processes  and improved overall organizational performance 
the generation and marketing strategy calls for increased asset backed marketing and generation capacity supported by long term contracts  balanced with stringent risk management policies 
the company s future growth plans call for approximately of its new generation portfolio to be committed through long term contracts  including sales to retail customers 
growth will be dependent on market development  and upon the company s ability to generate funds for the company s future expansion 
although the current environment has led the company to scale back its expansion plans  the company will continue to operate in the wholesale market 
expansion of the company s generating portfolio will depend upon acquiring favorably priced assets at strategic locations and securing long term commitments for the purchase of power from the acquired plants 
intentionally left blank results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated the company s net earnings available to common shareholders for the year ended december  were million  a decrease in net earnings from million in this decrease primarily reflects the slowdown in the wholesale electric market  where both prices and market liquidity were significantly lower than the prior year 
despite the slowdown in the wholesale electric market  pnm s electric utility operations recorded an operating income growth of 
this growth came from a combination of load growth and cost savings  demonstrating the balance the regulated utility provides in the company s merchant utility strategy 
earnings in and were affected by certain non recurring gains and charges

despite the volume decline  customer growth was approximately 
pnm purchases natural gas in the open market and resells it at cost to its distribution customers 
as a result  increases or decreases in gas revenues driven by gas costs do not impact the company s consolidated gross margin or earnings

the gross margin  or operating revenues minus cost of energy sold  decreased million or 
this decrease is due mainly to lower consumption of gas for electric generation of million partially offset by a growth in customer base of million 
gross margin is expected to decrease in due to the expiration of a rate rider in january the company currently believes that gas assets are not earning an adequate level of return 
as a result  the company filed a request for increased rates in january the company s last gas rate case filing was in october total non fuel operating expenses decreased million or 
administrative and other costs decreased only slightly from the prior year 
in  the company recognized lower bad debt expense of million because of collection improvements and the absence of losses from the bankruptcy of a significant customer in  lower amortization costs of million for sfas deferred costs which were fully amortized in  and lower consulting expenses of million in connection with cost control and process improvement initiatives in and lower legal expenses of million for routine business matters 
these decreases were mostly offset by higher allocated corporate administrative costs of million

this decrease in wholesale electricity sales primarily reflects the slowdown in the wholesale electric market  which resulted from steep declines in wholesale prices and market liquidity as compared to the prior year period 
the significantly higher wholesale pricing in was driven by increased demand in california  a lack of generating assets to serve the market and the impact of warm weather 
by contrast  has seen relatively mild weather in the west  an abundance of low cost hydropower and weak economic conditions in the region 
as a result  the average price realized by the company fell to approximately per mwh in versus per mwh in the low wholesale prices are expected to continue into the decline in merchant sales volumes reflect the reduction in market participants in the wholesale market caused by bankruptcy  reduced credit quality of firms in the market and firms exiting the wholesale market 
there are also significant unresolved legal  political and regulatory issues that had a dampening effect on activity in the marketplace 
as a result  the company s spot market and short term sales have declined significantly 
the company delivered wholesale bulk power of million mwh of electricity for the year ended december   compared to million mwh for the same period in although other firms have exited the wholesale market or have had their access to the wholesale market limited due to concerns over credit quality  the company remains committed to be a participant in this market place 
while market liquidity is weak  the company will focus on long term relationships with smaller wholesale customers small investor owned utilities  municipal utilities and co ops 
at the same time  the company will continue to monitor market conditions 
this commitment to the wholesale market leaves the company poised to participate in the market as liquidity returns and regulatory issues are resolved

lower margins were created primarily by weak pricing  less price volatility and lower market liquidity 
in addition  unexpected outages at four corners reduced availability of power for wholesale sales 
these lower margins were partially offset by a favorable change in the mark to market position of the marketing portfolio of million year over year million gain in versus million loss in 
a majority of the gain in represents the reversal of previously recognized mark to market losses 
total non fuel operating expenses decreased million or 
administrative and other costs increased million or for the year 
this increase is primarily due to higher corporate administrative cost allocations of million  partially offset by an adjustment of million to prior year san juan generating station sjgs participant billings the company is the operator of sjgs and shares costs with other owners and lower costs of million resulting from increased capital activity for generation expansion 
energy production costs decreased million or for the period reflecting the benefits of million for the acceleration into of a planned outage at sjgs  decreased costs of million for planned outages at sjgs and an adjustment of million to prior year palo verde nuclear generating station pvngs billings from arizona public service company  the operator of pvngs 
these cost decreases were partially offset by costs of million related to the future expansion of afton generating station afton  severance costs of million at pvngs and four corners power plant four corners  costs of million for planned and unplanned outages at four corners and costs of million at lordsburg generating station lordsburg  which became fully operational in june depreciation and amortization increased million or due to the addition of lordsburg

income taxes  which include income taxes for interest charges  decreased million or due to a decline in pre tax income 
corporate corporate administrative and general costs  which represent costs that are driven primarily by corporate level activities  increased million or for the period to million 
this increase was due to severance costs of million resulting from a realignment of the company s business structure the realignment  higher labor of million resulting from a transfer of employees from operations to corporate and outside services of million primarily related to audit and other consulting services 
these increases were partially offset by lower bonus expense of million in the current year resulting from lower earnings projections and lower costs of million resulting from the reduction of certain unregulated activities 
in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity eitf  the company incurred a liability of million for severance and other related costs associated with the involuntary termination of employees in connection with the realignment 
as of december   million of severance related benefits were paid and charged against the liability 
other non operating other income decreased by million or reflecting lower year over year returns on investments reflecting market conditions

total non fuel operating expenses increased million or 
administrative and general costs increased million or for the period 
this increase is primarily due to higher allocated corporate administrative costs of million 
consulting expenses focused on cost control and process improvement initiatives also contributed to the increase 
these increases were partially offset by lower bad debt and collection expense of million 
by december  the company had resolved most of the problems associated with implementing its new billing system 
as a result  bad debt expense was significantly lower in depreciation and amortization increased million or due to a higher depreciable plant base 
transmission and distribution costs increased million or primarily due to a non recurring increase in maintenance to improve reliability for the transmission and distribution systems

the company purchases natural gas in the open market and resells it at cost to its distribution customers 
as a result  increased gas revenues driven by increased gas costs do not impact the company s gross margin or earnings 
the revenue increase was driven primarily by a increase in average gas prices in the first half of  resulting from increased market demand 
in addition  a volume increase and a gas rate increase  which became effective october  contributed to the increase 
the gas rate increase added million of revenue 
transportation volume increased or million 
this growth was primarily attributed to gas transportation customers whose increased demand was driven by the strong power market in the western united states during the first half of approximately million of gas revenue in was attributable to sales to the company s generation and marketing operations

the high wholesale prices seen in and did not recur in at the end of the second quarter of  the market experienced declining price levels 
this trend continued in the last half of as a result  market liquidity the opportunity to buy and resell power profitably in the marketplace also declined reflecting the bankruptcy of a major  market participant and limited price volatility 
operating revenues grew million or for the period to billion 
this increase in wholesale electricity sales primarily reflects the strong regional wholesale electric prices in the first half of the company delivered wholesale bulk power of million mwh of electricity in  compared to million mwh in the prior period 
the average price realized by the company increased to approximately per mwh in compared to per mwh in wholesale revenues from third party customers increased from million to billion  an increase

the following table shows sales by customer class generation and marketing sales megawatt hours year ended december  intersegment sales   long term contract   other merchant sales   the gross margin  or operating revenues minus cost of energy sold  increased million or 
the company s margin benefits significantly from rising gas prices as most of the company s generation portfolio is fueled by stable priced fuel sources  such as coal and uranium 
as the increase in gas prices puts upward pressure on electricity prices  the profitability of the company s stable low cost generation increases significantly 
margin also benefited from the company s power marketing activities 
the company buys and then resells electricity in the market generating incremental margin by taking advantage of price changes in the electricity sales market 
in addition  the company also tailors electric deliveries for its wholesale customers creating incremental margin opportunities 
generally  as market prices decline  marketing volumes rise supporting margin levels in lower price electric markets 
these higher margins were partially offset by an unfavorable change in the mark to market position of the marketing portfolio of million year over year million loss in versus million loss in as the western power market deterioration in the latter half of resulted in a reduction of the company s merchant energy portfolio 
total non fuel operating expenses increased million or 
administrative and general costs increased million or for the period 
this increase is primarily due to higher allocated corporate administrative costs of million and higher power marketing expenses of million mainly for additional incentive bonuses and consulting fees and other expenses of million related to business development and process improvement 
this increase was partially offset by lower year over year generation and marketing business development costs of million due to significant costs related to the acquisition of a long term wholesale customer 
energy production costs increased million or for the year 
the increase is primarily due to higher maintenance costs of million in resulting from scheduled and unscheduled outages at pvngs  sjgs and reeves generating station reeves  additional incentive bonuses of million at sjgs  and increased operations costs of million for generation at reeves  one of the company s gas generation facilities  which has a higher cost of production than the company s coal and nuclear facilities 
this increase was partially offset by lower maintenance costs of million at four corners as a result of decreased outage time 
a significant unscheduled outage occurred in the fall of at sjgs  which resulted in higher costs of million in the company took advantage of the outage to accelerate its outage scheduled for the spring of as a result  maintenance costs and the related lost market potential of the accelerated outage was avoided in the spring of depreciation and amortization increased million or for the period due to a higher depreciable plant base 
taxes other than income taxes decreased million or as a result of favorable audit outcomes by certain tax authorities 
income taxes  which include taxes for interest charges  increased million or due to an increase in pre tax income 
unregulated businesses in july  the board of directors of avistar decided to wind down all unregulated operations except for avistar s reliadigm business unit  which provides maintenance solutions and technologies to the electric power industry 
avistar had previously divested itself of its energy partners business unit and liquidated axon field services and pathways integration 
this divestiture was largely in response to market disruptions caused by the california energy crisis 
in addition  the transfer of operation of the sangre de cristo water company to the city of santa fe was completed in the third quarter of all remaining non reliadigm investments were written off with the exception of avistar s investment in nth power  an energy related venture capital fund 
these write downs reflect the significant decline in the technology market and bankruptcy of these investees 
the company recorded non operating charges of million to reflect these activities and the impairment of its avistar investments 
due to the cessation of much of avistar s historic operations  business activity declined significantly 
revenues decreased for the period to million 
operating losses for avistar decreased from million in to million in primarily due to decreased costs as a result of the shutdown of certain operations 
in january  avistar was transferred by way of a dividend to holding company by pnm 
corporate corporate administrative and general costs  which represent costs that are driven exclusively by corporate level activities  increased million or for the period to million 
this increase was due to increased pension and post retirement benefits expense of million and higher legal costs of million associated with routine business operations 
other non operating costs other income decreased million for the year 
in  the company recognized a gain of million related to the settlement of a lawsuit 
other deductions increased million for the year 
in  the company recorded charges of million to write off certain permanently impaired avistar investments  million of non recoverable coal mine decommissioning costs previously established as a regulatory asset  non recoverable regulatory costs of million  a donation of million to the pnm foundation and a charge of million related to the company s terminated acquisition of western resources 
in  the company recognized gains of million for the reversal of certain reserves associated with the resolution of two gas rate claims and million related to the company s hedge of certain non qualified retirement plan trust assets 
in addition  in  the company recorded charges of million related to the company s terminated acquisition of western resources 
income taxes the company s consolidated income tax expense was million in the twelve months ended december   an increase of million for the year 
this increase was due to higher earnings in the company s effective income tax rates for the years ended and were and  respectively 
in  the company determined that million of valuation allowances taken against certain income tax related regulatory assets were no longer required due to changes in the evaluation of its regulatory strategy in light of the holding company filing in may in  when the allowance was established  management believed these income tax related regulatory assets would not be recoverable based on the probable regulatory outcome of industry restructuring in new mexico 
currently  management fully expects to recover these costs in future rate cases  a situation that was not possible prior to the delay of open access in new mexico 
excluding the impact of the valuation reserve changes  the company s effective income tax rates for the years ended and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate was primarily due to the favorable tax treatment received on equity earnings from a passive investment 
future expectations on january   the company announced that it expects earnings for the twelve months to be in the range of to 
although the company s electric utility continues to perform well  the depressed level of wholesale prices in the west  coupled with the significantly decreased marketing activity in that market  has severely limited the earnings potential of generation and marketing 
this estimated range is based on a number of factors  including growth rates in the new mexico service territory  wholesale prices  merchant sales velocity ability to market around assets and spark spread 
please note that the following are simplifying guidelines that attempt to quantify a number of complex and interdependent factors affecting the company s earnings 
these are provided to generally assist investors in developing their own independent assessment of the company s future earnings prospects 
as a result of an agreement global electric agreement approved by regulators in january  retail electric rates will decline by beginning in september  which is projected to reduce earnings by per share for the year 
the global electric agreement also provides for recovery of million of coal mine decommissioning costs to be amortized over years 
those costs will be amortized beginning september  reducing earnings by per share in retail electric revenue growth is projected at about  with every increase in load adding per share 
for further information see other issues facing the company merchant plant filing and global electric agreement 
return on the company s gas assets will continue to be poor in in  this return was below  and in returns will be reduced by another million through the expiration of an existing rate rider in january the company filed a gas rate case in january  seeking a million rate increase in cost of service rates and a million increase in miscellaneous fees 
this case is subject to a ten month timeframe  which may be extended 
if an order is received within this timeframe  the company would have some small improvement in earnings per share in december on the wholesale side  the baseline forecast assumes continued low liquidity and a marginal improvement in prices 
the company is projecting an average market price of about mwh  around the clock on an annualized basis 
although the current forward prices are stronger than this  the forward price curve cannot translate directly to the company s mix of short term and long term sales 
a change in market price equals per share 
the company is assuming a merchant sales velocity for the year of about  which is about more power sold than actually generated by pnm 
velocity did pick up at the end of  boosting overall velocity for the year to when velocity goes from to  earnings increase per share 
the company s earnings guidance assumes spark spread remains at levels that will restrict operation of pnm s gas fired assets to capacity factors below 
several increases in cost affect earnings potential in the company s earnings assumptions include increased medical and pension costs for the year 
the impact of low interest rates and poor market performance on the pension fund in will be offset somewhat by a million contribution to the fund in insurance costs since september  have also risen sharply 
longer plant maintenance schedules and lost market opportunity from plant unavailability will also put pressure on earnings in pvngs will replace a steam generator in unit  which will add forty two days to its regular planned outage schedule 
san juan has scheduled two major outages this year  extending the regular outage schedule by fifty days more than in addition  this will be the first full year of operation and maintenance costs and depreciation for the company s new plants in southern new mexico  afton and lordsburg 
in  the company s construction expenditures were million of which  million was for new generating plants 
over the five year planning horizon  the company expects capital expenditures  not inclusive of any generation acquisitions  to average million a year 
in  capital expenditures are estimated to be million due to the front loading of certain projects such as the replacement of the steam generator at pvngs  increased plant outage schedules including a turbine rewind at san juan  a turbine progress payment and other non utility capital increases 
the company expects to fund these expenditures from internal cash generation and current debt capacity 
although other firms have exited the wholesale market or have had their access to the wholesale market limited due to concerns over credit quality  the company remains committed to be a participant in this market place 
while market liquidity remains low  the company will focus on long term relationships with smaller wholesale customers small investor owned utilities  municipal utilities and co ops 
at the same time  the company will continue to monitor market conditions 
this commitment to the wholesale market leaves the company poised to participate in the market as liquidity returns and regulatory issues are resolved 
this discussion of future expectations is forward looking information within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of the achievement of expected results is dependent upon the assumptions described in the preceding discussion  and is qualified in its entirety by the private securities litigation reform act of disclosure see disclosure regarding forward looking statements below and the factors described within the disclosure that could cause the company s actual financial results to differ materially from the expected results discussed above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that management to select and apply accounting policies that best provide the framework to report the company s results of operations and financial position 
the selection and application of those policies require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments concerning reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
the judgments and uncertainties inherent in this process affect the application of those policies 
as a result  there exists the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
management has identified the following accounting policies that it deems critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that involve significant subjectivity 
management believes that its selection and application of these policies best represent the operating results and financial position of the company 
the following discussion provides information on the processes utilized by management in making judgments and assumptions as they apply to its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition unbilled utility revenues revenues related to the sale of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of the energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
the cycle meter reading results in unbilled consumption between the date of the last meter reading in a particular month and the end of the month 
this unbilled revenue is estimated each month based on the daily generation volumes  estimated customer usage by class  weather factors  line losses and applicable customer rates based on regression analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience 
the company purchases gas on behalf of sales service customers while other marketers or producers purchase gas on behalf of transportation service customers 
the company collects a cost of service revenue for the transportation  delivery  and customer service provided to these customers 
sales service tariffs are subject to the terms of the purchase gas adjustment clause pgac while transportation service customers are metered and billed on the last day of the month 
therefore  the company estimates unbilled decatherms and cost of service revenues for sales service customers only 
the unbilled decatherms are based on consumption estimates and the associated cost of service revenue for the period 
a cycle bill contains an amount for both the current period s consumption and the prior period s consumption 
the unbilled portion that is recorded is estimated as a percentage of the next month s budgeted cycle billings 
these budgets are prepared using historical data adjusted for known trends  including prior period consumption 
adjustments are also made to the budgeted cycle billings for weather variations above or below normal  customer growth  and any pricing changes by customer rate and revenue class 
any differences between the estimate and the actual cycle billings are recorded in the month billed 
unbilled wholesale power marketing revenues wholesale power marketing revenues are recognized in the month the energy is delivered to the customer and are based on the actual amounts supplied to the customer 
however  in accordance with the western systems power pool contract  these revenues are billed in the month subsequent to their delivery 
consequently  wholesale power marketing revenues for the last month in any reporting period are unbilled when reported 
accrued unbilled utility revenues and unbilled wholesale power marketing revenues are combined and specifically identified in the consolidated balance sheets 
regulatory assets and liabilities the accounting rules for rate regulated entities require a company to reflect the effects of regulatory decisions in its financial statements pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards  no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
in accordance with these accounting rules  the company has deferred certain costs that are rate recoverable and recorded certain liabilities for amounts to be returned to retail customers pursuant to the rate actions of the prc and its predecessor and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
substantially all of the company s regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are reflected in rates charged to retail customers or have been addressed in a regulatory proceeding 
to the extent that management concludes that the recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable due to changes in regulatory treatment  the effects of competition or other factors  the amount would be recorded as a charge to earnings as recovery is no longer probable 
the company continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes  recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction  anticipated future regulatory decisions and their impact  competition on the ratemaking process and the ability to recover costs  and the status of any deregulation legislation 
the company discontinued the application of regulatory accounting as of december   for the generation portion of its business effective with the passage in new mexico of the electric utility industry restructuring act of restructuring act 
the company evaluated these assets under the same impairment rules that it uses to evaluate tangible long lived assets 
during  the company entered into negotiations with the prc staff and other interveners regarding a rate settlement in anticipation of open access occurring in new mexico under the restructuring act 
as part of the negotiations  the parties in the settlement discussions agreed on a fixed dollar amount of stranded costs that would be recovered through a non bypassable wires charge 
in  the company recorded a charge to earnings of million as valuation allowances against certain income tax related regulatory assets 
this charge was equal to the difference between the agreed to dollar amount and the actual stranded costs that were recorded on the company s balance sheet 
the write off was not specific to any one particular regulatory asset but was simply the difference between the two previously discussed amounts 
before a final settlement was reached  the new mexico legislature in passed senate bill  that delayed open access 
with the passage of senate bill  the settlement discussions terminated 
therefore  in the company reversed the valuation allowance as it was determined that it was no longer required due to changes in the evaluation of the company s regulatory strategy in light of the holding company filing in may in august  the company signed an agreement with san juan coal company sjcc and tucson electric power company tucson to replace two surface mining operations with a single underground mine located adjacent to the sjgs 
as a result of the negotiations for the new coal contract  the company recorded a regulatory asset in for the estimated costs anticipated to close the surface mining operation 
this regulatory asset was anticipated to be recovered through the non bypassable wires charge discussed above 
as the settlement discussions progressed  it became clear that a portion of the costs capitalized by the company for decommissioning the coal mine would not be collectible 
as a result  the company was unable to defer this portion of coal mine decommissioning costs as a regulatory asset for future recovery through regulated rates 
therefore  in  the company wrote off million for the portion of coal mine decommissioning costs associated with the company s ferc firm requirements customers and a portion of sjgs unit in addition  the company wrote off million of additional regulatory assets of which million related to non recoverable transition costs and million for other non recoverable regulatory assets 
on october   the company and several other parties signed the global electric agreement  that provides for a five year rate path for the company s new mexico jurisdictional customers beginning in september of the global electric agreement also seeks to repeal the restructuring act 
the company will re apply sfas to its generation and marketing operations during the first quarter of as the global electric agreement was approved by the prc on january  in connection with the global electric agreement  the company has agreed to forego recovery of the transition costs incurred to date 
the forgone transition costs include professional fees  financing costs including underwriting fees  costs relating to the transfer of assets  the cost of management information system changes including billing system changes  and public and customer communication costs 
the company will incur a one time charge of million for the non recoverable transition costs in the first quarter of as the company s electric rates are fixed  the opportunity to recover increased costs and the costs of new investment in facilities through rates during the five year rate freeze period is also limited 
the company will continue to assess the recoverability of its regulatory assets 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the company would be required to record a charge for the portion of the costs that were not recoverable in current period earnings 
asset impairment the company evaluates its tangible long lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
these potential impairment triggers would include fluctuating market conditions as a result of industry deregulation  planned and scheduled customer purchase commitments  future market penetration  customer growth  fluctuating market prices resulting from changing fuel costs  other economic conditions  etc  weather patterns  and other market trends 
accounting rules require that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a company s asset without interest charges that will be recognized as expenses when incurred  is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of impairment recognized is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset 
impairment testing for the company s power generation assets is done in two parts those power generation assets used to supply new mexico retail customer needs evaluated as one group and those used to supply wholesale market needs evaluated as another group 
management s assumptions about future prices  volumes  and other market trends in the wholesale electricity market have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to be volatile 
a significant adverse change in these assumptions may result in an impairment of the company s power generation assets 
please note that the assumptions inherent in the company s analysis of asset impairment are inter dependent 
changes in any one assumption is a simplified view which attempts to give the reader an understanding of the sensitivities affecting the company s earnings 
if market prices were to decrease below the company s projected average market price of mwh  the company may be required to recognize a charge to earnings for the related asset impairment in accordance with sfas pension and other post retirement benefits the company and its subsidiaries maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan the plan  which covers eligible non union and union employees including officers 
the plan was frozen at the end of to new participants  salary levels and benefits 
the company s policy is to fund actuarially determined contributions 
the company s income for its plan approximated million for the year ended december   and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on the plan assets of 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption  the company evaluated input from its actuaries  including their review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
this long term rate of return assumption compares to the historical year compounded return of through the end of december the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of with equity managers  with fixed income managers  and with alternative investments that are primarily real estate and timber 
because of market fluctuation  the plan s actual asset allocation as of december  was with equity managers  with fixed income managers  and with alternative investments 
the company reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the asset allocation to the targeted allocation 
the company continues to believe that is a reasonable long term rate of return on the plan s assets  despite the recent market downturn in which the plan assets had an actual loss of for the twelve months ended december  the company will continue to evaluate its actuarial assumptions  including expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust as necessary 
the company bases its determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
if investment return is outside a range of to expected long term rate of return plus or minus  this market related valuation recognizes the portion of return that is outside the range over a five year period from the year in which the return occurs 
since the market related value of assets recognizes the portion of return that is outside the range over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred returns are recorded 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of long term high grade bonds 
the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased to at september  from at september  based on an expected rate of return on the plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions  it is estimated that the pension expense for the plan will approximate million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year future actual pension income or expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension plans 
lowering the plan s expected long term rate of return on pension assets by from to would have lowered pension income for fiscal by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate by would have lowered pension income for fiscal year by approximately  the value of the plan assets has decreased from million at september  to million at september  including million of contributions during the company expects to make million in contributions for the plan year 
these contributions are expected to help the company avoid potential actions of the pension benefit guaranty corporation for under funded plans including higher insurance premiums and notification to participants of the under funded plan status 
decommissioning costs accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear and fossil fuel generation involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future 
changes in these estimates could significantly impact the company s financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
the company owns and leases nuclear and fossil fuel facilities that are within and outside of its retail service areas 
the company will adopt the new accounting requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas in the first quarter of under sfas  the company is only required to recognize and measure decommissioning liabilities for tangible long lived assets for which a legal obligation exists 
adoption of the statement will change the company s method of accounting for both nuclear generation decommissioning and fossil fuel generation decommissioning 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations new and proposed accounting standards  for additional discussion regarding the company s accounting policy for decommissioning and the anticipated effects for adoption of the new standard 
nuclear decommissioning costs are based on site specific estimates of the costs for removing all radioactive and other structures at the site 
pvngs unit is currently excluded from the company s retail rate base while units and are included in the company s retail rate base 
the company collects a provision for ultimate decommissioning of units and in its rates 
fossil fuel decommissioning costs are also approved by the prc as a component of the company s depreciation rates 
the company believes that it will continue to be able to collect for its legal asset retirement obligations for nuclear and fossil fuel generation activities included in the ratemaking process described above 
in addition  the company has a contractual obligation with the pvngs participants to fund separately the nuclear decommissioning at a level in excess of what the company has identified as its legal asset retirement obligation under sfas the contractual funding obligation is based on a site specific estimate prepared by a third party 
the company s most recent site specific estimates for nuclear decommissioning costs were developed in  using cost factors  and are based on prompt dismantlement decommissioning  reflecting the costs of removal discussed above  with such removal occurring shortly after operating license expiration 
the company s share of the contractual funding obligation is approximately million dollars at december  the estimates are subject to change based on a variety of factors including  cost escalation  changes in technology applicable to nuclear decommissioning and changes in federal  state or local regulations 
the operating licenses for pvngs units  and expire in   and  respectively 
the company does not have a similar contractual funding obligation related to its fossil fuel plants 
self insurance the company self insures for certain losses related to general liability  workers compensation and automobile claims 
the company maintains insurance with third party insurers in excess of the company s self insured retentions to limit the company s exposure per occurrence or accident  as applicable 
the company s self insurance liabilities reflect the estimated ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon claims filed  estimated claims incurred but not reported  and analyses of industry and historical data 
management reviews the amounts recorded for these liabilities on a quarterly basis to ensure that they are appropriate 
while management believes that these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  the company s financial results could be impacted if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims or fluctuations in premiums  differ from the company s estimates 
contingent liabilities there are various claims and lawsuits pending against the company and certain of its subsidiaries 
the company has recorded a liability where the effect of litigation can be estimated and where an outcome is considered probable 
management s estimates are based on its knowledge of the relevant facts at the time of the issuance of the company s consolidated financial statements 
subsequent developments could materially alter management s assessment of a matter s probable outcome and the estimate of liability 
environmental issues the company records its environmental liabilities when site assessments or remedial actions are probable and a range of reasonably likely cleanup costs can be estimated 
the company reviews its sites and measures the liability quarterly  by assessing a range of reasonably likely costs for each identified site using currently available information  including existing technology  current laws and regulations  experience gained at similar sites  and the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties 
these estimates include costs for site investigations  remediation  operations and maintenance  monitoring and site closure 
unless there is a probable amount  the company records the lower end of this reasonably likely range of costs classified as other long term liabilities at undiscounted amounts 
subsequent developments could materially alter management s assessment of a matter s probable outcome and the estimate of liability 
legal fees the company is involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
the associated legal costs for these legal matters are accrued when incurred 
it is also the company s policy to accrue for legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies sfas legal matters when it is probable that a sfas liability has been incurred and the amount of expected legal costs to be incurred is reasonably estimable 
these estimates include costs for external counsel and professional fees

liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash and short term cash investments of million compared to million in cash and short term and long term cash investments at december  certain long term investments have been reclassified as short term to reflect the company s liquidity needs to fund certain construction projects in cash provided from operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a decline in operating income due to the deterioration of wholesale market conditions 
also  contributing to the decrease was a payment of million for the termination of the surface coal mine contract  the company s million contribution to its pension and post retirement benefit plans and a payment of million to secure a long term wholesale contract 
in addition  the company did not make its first quarter estimated federal income tax payment of million until january because of an extension granted by the irs to taxpayers in several counties in new mexico as a result of wildfires in these non recurring payments reduced operating cash flows below historical levels 
cash used for investing activities was million in compared to million in cash used for investing activities includes construction expenditures for new generating plants of million in compared to million in payments for combustion turbines not yet included in plant were million in compared to million in in addition  cash used for investing in includes the purchase of short term and long term investments of million 
the change in cash used for investing activities was partially offset by the redemption of short term investments of million in expenditures in reflect the acquisition of certain transmission assets and other related investing activities of million 
cash generated by financing activities was million in compared to million in financing activities in were primarily short term borrowings of million compared to million in for liquidity reasons  partially offset by an increase in cash payments for common stock dividends 
capital requirements total capital requirements include construction expenditures as well as other major capital requirements and cash dividend requirements for both common and preferred stock 
the main focus of the company s current construction program is upgrading generation systems upgrading and expanding the electric and gas transmission and distribution systems  and purchasing nuclear fuel 
to preserve a strong financial position  the company announced in its plans to eliminate capital expenditures for previously planned generation expansion until market conditions warrant further investment 
projections for total capital requirements for are million and projections for construction expenditures for are million including remaining payments on the combustion turbines discussed below 
for projections  total capital requirements are million and construction expenditures are million 
these estimates are under continuing review and subject to on going adjustment 
pnm had previously committed to purchase five combustion turbines for a total cost of million 
the turbines are for power generation plants with an estimated cost of construction of approximately million over the next five years depending on market conditions 
pnm has expended million as of december  of which million was for equipment purchases 
on june   lordsburg  an mw natural gas fired plant  became fully operational and commenced serving the wholesale power market 
afton  a mw simple cycle gas turbine  became fully operational on december  these plants are part of the company s ongoing competitive strategy of increasing generation capacity over time to serve increasing retail load  sales under long term contracts and other merchant sales 
these plants were not originally planned to serve new mexico retail customers and therefore are not currently  included in the rate base 
however  it is possible that these plants may be needed in the future to serve the growing retail load 
if so  these plants will have to be certified by the prc and would then be included in the rate base 
in  the company utilized cash generated from operations  cash on hand  as well as its liquidity arrangements to cover its construction commitments 
the company anticipates that internal cash generation and current debt capacity will be sufficient to meet all its capital requirements for the years through to cover the difference in the amounts and timing of cash generation and cash requirements  the company intends to use short term borrowings under its current and future liquidity arrangements 
liquidity as of february   pnm had million of liquidity arrangements in addition to million of cash 
the liquidity arrangements consist of million from an unsecured revolving credit facility credit facility and million in local lines of credit 
pnm entered into a new revolving credit facility on december   which increased borrowing capacity from million to million 
this facility will mature december  there were million in borrowings against the credit facility as of february  in addition  the holding company has million in local lines of credit 
the company s ability  if required  to access the capital markets at a reasonable cost and to provide for other capital needs is largely dependent upon its ability to earn a fair return on equity  results of operations  credit ratings  regulatory approvals and financial and wholesale market conditions 
financing flexibility is enhanced by providing a high percentage of total capital requirements from internal sources and having the ability  if necessary  to issue long term securities  and to obtain short term credit 
pnm s credit outlook is considered stable by moody s investor services  inc moody s and standard and poor s ratings services s p and positive by fitch  inc fitch

the lease expense for pvngs is million per year over base lease terms expiring in and in  pnm established pvngs capital trust capital trust for the purpose of acquiring all the debt underlying the pvngs leases 
pnm consolidates capital trust in its consolidated financial statements 
the purchase was funded with the proceeds from the issuance of million of suns  which were loaned to capital trust 
capital trust then acquired and now holds the debt component of the pvngs leases 
for legal and regulatory reasons  the pvngs lease payment continues to be recorded and paid gross with the debt component of the payment returned to pnm via capital trust 
as a result  the net cash outflows for the pvngs lease payment were million for the year ended december  the table above reflects the net lease payment 
pnm s other significant operating lease obligations include the eip  a leased interest in transmission line with annual lease payments of million see planned financing activities below  and an operating lease for the entire output of delta  a gas fired generating plant in albuquerque  new mexico  with imputed annual lease payments of million 
the company s off balance sheet obligations are limited to pnm s operating leases and certain financial instruments related to the purchase and sale of energy see below 
the present value of pnm s operating lease obligations for pvngs units and  eip and the delta operating lease was million as of december  pnm has entered into various long term power purchase agreements ppas obligating it to buy electricity for aggregate fixed payments of million plus the cost of production and a return 
these contracts expire december through july in addition  pnm is obligated to sell electricity for million in fixed payments plus the cost of production and a return 
these contracts expire december through june pnm s marketing portfolio as of december  included open contract positions to buy million of electricity and to sell million of electricity 
in addition  pnm had open forward positions classified as normal sales of electricity under the derivative accounting rules of million and normal purchases of electricity of million 
pnm contracts for the purchase of gas to serve its retail customers 
these contracts are short term in nature  supplying the gas needs for the current heating season and the following off season months 
the price of gas is a pass through  whereby pnm recovers of its cost of gas 
contingent provisions of certain obligations the holding company and pnm have a number of debt obligations and other contractual commitments that contain contingent provisions 
some of these  if triggered  could affect the liquidity of the company 
the holding company or pnm could be required to provide security  immediately pay outstanding obligations or be prevented from drawing on unused capacity under certain credit agreements if the contingent requirements were to be triggered 
the most significant consequences resulting from these contingent requirements are detailed in the discussion below 
pnm s master purchase agreement for the procurement of gas for its retail customers contains a contingent requirement that could require pnm to provide security for its gas purchase obligations if the seller were to reasonably believe that pnm was unable to fulfill its payment obligations under the agreement 
the master agreement for the sale of electricity in the western systems power pool wspp contains a contingent requirement that could require pnm to provide security if its debt were to fall below investment grade rating 
the wspp agreement also contains a contingent requirement  commonly called a material adverse change mac provision  which could require pnm to provide security if a material adverse change in its financial condition or operations were to occur 
pnm s committed credit facility contains a ratings trigger 
if pnm is downgraded or upgraded by the ratings agencies  the result would be an increase or decrease in interest cost  respectively 
pnm s committed credit facility contains a mac provision which  if triggered  could prevent pnm from drawing on its unused capacity under the credit facility 
in addition  the credit facility contains a contingent requirement that requires pnm to maintain a debt to capital ratio  inclusive of off balance sheet debt  of less than as well as maintenance of an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda interest coverage ratio of three times 
if pnm s debt to capital ratio  inclusive of off balance sheet debt  were to exceed or its interest coverage ratio falls below  pnm could be required to repay all borrowings under the credit facility  be prevented from drawing on the unused capacity under the credit facility  and be required to provide security for all outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
at december   pnm had million of letters of credit outstanding 
the outstanding balance of the credit facility at december  was million 
if a contingent requirement were to be triggered under the credit facility resulting in an acceleration of the outstanding loans under the credit facility  a cross default provision in the pvngs leases could occur if the accelerated amount is not paid 
if a cross default provision is triggered  the lessors have the ability to accelerate their rights under the leases  including acceleration of all future lease payments 
planned financing activities as of december   pnm has million of long term debt that matures in august excluding sinking fund payments related to eip secured lease bonds 
all other long term debt of pnm matures in or later 
the company could enter into other long term financings for the purpose of strengthening its balance sheet  funding growth and reducing its cost of capital 
the company continues to evaluate its investment and debt retirement options to optimize its financing strategy and earnings potential 
no additional first mortgage bonds may be issued under pnm s mortgage 
the amount of suns that may be issued is not limited by the suns indenture 
however  debt to capital requirements in certain of pnm s financial instruments and regulatory agreements would ultimately limit the amount of additional debt pnm would issue 
pnm currently has million of tax exempt bonds outstanding that were callable at a premium beginning december   and an additional million that become callable at a premium in august pnm intends to refinance these bonds  assuming the interest rate of the refinancing does not exceed the current interest rate of the bonds  and has hedged the entire planned refinancing 
the company received regulatory approval to refund the tax exempt bonds on october  this approval is effective for one year 
in order to take advantage of current low interest rates  pnm entered into five forward starting interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of pnm designated these swaps as cash flow hedges 
the hedged risks associated with these instruments are the changes in cash flows related to general moves in interest rates expected for the refinancing 
the swaps effectively cap the interest rate on the refinancing to plus an adjustment for pnm s and the industry s credit rating 
pnm s assessment of hedge effectiveness is based on changes in the hedge interest rates 
the derivative accounting rules  as amended  provide that the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings 
any hedge ineffectiveness is required to be presented in current earnings 
for the year ended december   pnm recognized million of hedge ineffectiveness in earnings 
at december   the fair market value of these derivative financial instruments was approximately million unfavorable to the company 
a forward starting swap does not require any upfront premium and captures changes in the corporate credit component of an investment grade company s interest rate as well as the underlying benchmark 
the five forward starting interest rate swaps have a termination date of may  for a combined notional amount of million 
there were no fees on the transaction  as they are imbedded in the rates  and the transaction will be settled in cash on the mandatory unwind date strike date corresponding to the refinancing date of the underlying debt 
the settlement will be capitalized as a cost of issuance and amortized over the life of the debt as a yield adjustment provided that the forecasted transactions interest payments occur as anticipated 
the company would seek regulatory approval to recover any hedge cost which could not be capitalized under the accounting rules in its next litigated electric rate proceeding 
on november   the company filed for approval from the prc to enter into a transaction providing for the securitization of pnm s retail electric service accounts receivable  wholesale electric service accounts receivables and retail gas services accounts receivable securitization to reduce the amount of debt outstanding under the credit facility and to raise cash for pnm s ongoing working capital requirements and other capital requirements 
the total capacity  or maximum that could be borrowed  under the securitization will not exceed million 
in the proposed transaction  pnm would sell its accounts receivables from time to time 
the prc approved this request on december  the company expects to enter into this transaction in march pnm has notified the holding company that it intends to exercise its early buyout option related to its ownership interest in the eip transmission line and related facilities 
in conjunction with the early buyout option  pnm will retire the related million of debt 
pnm caused the related notification of mandatory redemptions to be distributed on february   calling the debt on april  additionally  the company acquired the remaining million of publicly traded eip secured facility bonds 
these bonds have been retired and ownership of the related lease debt is expected to be transferred to pnm  subject to regulatory approvals 
dividends the holding company s board of directors regularly reviews the dividend policy 
the declaration of common dividends is dependent upon a number of factors including the ability of the holding company s subsidiaries to pay dividends 
currently  pnm is the holding company s primary source of dividends 
as part of the order approving the formation of the holding company  the prc placed certain restrictions on the ability of pnm to pay dividends to the holding company 
pnm cannot pay dividends that will cause its debt rating to go below investment grade  and pnm cannot pay dividends in any year  as determined on a rolling four quarter basis  in excess of net earnings for that year without prior prc approval 
in january  with the signing of the global electric agreement  the prc modified the pnm dividend restriction to allow pnm to dividend future equity contributions made by the holding company back to the holding company 
additionally  pnm has various financial covenants  which limit the transfer of assets  whether through dividends or other means 
in addition  the ability of the holding company to declare dividends is dependent upon the extent to which cash flows will support dividends  the availability of earnings  its financial circumstances and performance  the effect of regulatory decisions and legislative activities  future growth plans  the related capital requirements  standard business considerations and market and economic conditions generally 
consistent with the prc s holding company order  pnm paid dividends of million to the holding company on december  on march   the pnm board of directors declared a dividend of million  which was paid on march  on june   the pnm board of directors declared a dividend of million  which was paid on june  on february   the holding company s board of directors approved a increase in the common stock dividend 
the increase raised the quarterly dividend to per share  for an indicated annual dividend of per share 
capital structure the company s capitalization  including current maturities of long term debt  at december  and are shown below common equity preferred stock long term debt total capitalization total capitalization does not include as debt the present value of pnm s operating lease obligations for pvngs units and  eip and the delta operating lease  which was million as of december  and million as of december  other issues facing the company restructuring the electric utility industry state in april  the new mexico electric utility industry restructuring act of restructuring act was enacted into law 
the restructuring act opens the state s electric power market to customer choice 
in march  amendments to the restructuring act were passed which delayed the original implementation dates by approximately five years  including the requirement for corporate separation of supply service and energy related service assets from distribution and transmission service assets 
the restructuring act  as amended  will give schools  residential and small business customers the opportunity to choose among competing power suppliers beginning in january competition would be expanded to include all customers starting in july on october   pnm announced that it had agreed with the prc staff  the ag  and other consumer groups on the global electric agreement that includes agreement to support repeal of a majority of the restructuring act  as amended 
the global electric agreement  which includes agreement on a five year rate path  procedures for the company s participation in merchant plant activities and other regulatory issues  was approved by the prc on january  the new mexico legislature is currently in session 
legislation repealing the restructuring act  as amended  and continuing the authorization for utilities to participate in merchant plant activities for a limited time has been introduced as sb on february   sb passed the senate by a vote of it is now awaiting action in the house of representatives 
the company is unable to predict at this time if restructuring will occur as provided in current law or  if so  what form it will take 
see merchant plant filing and global electric agreement below 
the restructuring act  as amended  recognized that electric utilities should be permitted a reasonable opportunity to recover an appropriate amount of the costs previously incurred in providing electric service to their customers 
these stranded costs represent all costs associated with generation related assets  currently in rates  in excess of the expected competitive market price over the life of those assets and include plant decommissioning costs  regulatory assets  and lease and lease related costs 
utilities would be allowed to recover no less than of stranded costs through a non bypassable charge on all customer bills for five years after implementation of customer choice 
the prc could authorize a utility to recover up to of its stranded costs if the prc finds that recovery of more than i is in the public interest  ii is necessary to maintain the financial integrity of the public utility  iii is necessary to continue adequate and reliable service  and iv will not cause an increase in rates to residential or small business customers during the transition period 
the restructuring act  as amended  also allows for the recovery of nuclear decommissioning costs by means of a separate wires charge over the life of the underlying generation assets 
approximately million of costs associated with the power supply and energy services businesses under the restructuring act  as amended  were established as regulatory assets 
because of the company s belief that recovery is probable  these assets continue to be classified as regulatory assets  although the company has discontinued the use of accounting for rate regulated activities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further developments 
federal the th congress adjourned without passing comprehensive energy legislation 
both the house and the senate passed energy legislation but were unable to resolve disagreement on a number of provisions during conference committee discussions 
president bush has expressed his continuing commitment to his national energy policy and has urged congress to move forward with energy legislation 
key committee chairs in both the house and the senate have expressed desires to move quickly on a comprehensive energy bill 
the company is unable to predict if energy legislation will be passed or if passed  what form it will take  or if it will be signed by the president if passed 
merchant plant filing and global electric agreement senate bill sb  enacted by the session of the new mexico legislature  allowed public utilities to invest in  construct  acquire or operate generating plants not intended to provide retail electric service merchant plant  free of certain otherwise applicable regulatory requirements contained in the public utility act 
by order entered on march   the prc found that these provisions of sb raised issues such as cost allocations for ratemaking  revenue allocations for off system sales  how the prc can ensure the utility will meet its duty to provide service when the utility invests in merchant plant  how that plant will be financed and how transactions between regulated services and merchant plants will be conducted 
the prc initiated proceedings to address these issues 
in november  pnm began negotiations with the prc utility staff and intervenors in order to resolve its merchant plant filing and other matters 
discussions included the future framework for restructuring the electric industry in new mexico under the restructuring act  a future retail electric rate path and pnm s merchant plant filing 
the year long negotiations ended on october  with the filing of the global electric agreement with the prc 
the global electric agreement sets a rate path through and resolves the issues surrounding industry deregulation in new mexico and pnm s merchant power strategy 
the global electric agreement was signed by pnm  the prc staff  the new mexico attorney general s office  the new mexico industrial energy consumers  the city of albuquerque  and the university of new mexico 
the united states executive agencies usea subsequently agreed to support the global electric agreement as if they had signed it 
the global electric agreement also provides for the signatories to support passage of legislation to repeal the restructuring act and concerning merchant plant activities in the new mexico legislature 
the global electric agreement was approved by the prc on january  under the global electric agreement  pnm will decrease retail electric rates in two phases over the next three years 
the first phase will be a decrease  effective september the second phase will be a further decrease from current rate levels  effective in september rates would then be frozen at that level until the end of the company expects to achieve necessary cost savings through additional cost efficiencies and fuel savings 
the risks and benefits of all wholesale electric sales  inure solely to the company s shareholders until december since the global electric agreement does not provide for a fuel cost adjustment  the lower fuel costs sought to be captured by shifting to underground mining for the coal supplies at sjgs will flow through to the company s earnings largely offsetting the reduction in retail revenues 
pnm will be able to seek a general rate adjustment during the rate freeze period if complying with any new or changed environmental or tax law or regulation  or a new broader application of existing environmental or tax laws or regulations  would compromise its financial integrity 
pnm also is permitted to capitalize the reasonable costs of mandatory renewable energy resources  including an after tax cost of capital of to be recorded concurrently with the deferral of those costs 
pnm is authorized to recover in the stipulated rates and future retail rates  its new mexico jurisdictional share of the decommissioning costs associated with the san juan  la plata and navajo surface coal mines 
pnm is allowed to recover up to million of the costs  composed of approximately million in surface coal mine reclamation costs  and approximately million of contract buyout costs  without being subject to prudence challenge by the signatories to the global electric agreement 
the costs will be amortized over years commencing september  and in equal amounts each year thereafter 
pnm cannot seek to recover a return on the unamortized reclamation costs  but could seek to recover a return on the unamortized contract buyout costs remaining as of december  in future rate adjustment proceedings 
the stipulated rates also provide for full recovery of nuclear decommissioning costs accrued in accordance with the estimates in the applicable decommissioning cost study during the rate freeze period for pnm s interests in pvngs units and the portion of sjgs unit previously treated as an excluded resource from pnm s new mexico retail rates are included as a generation resource to serve pnm s new mexico retail and wholesale firm requirements customers load 
pnm s contracts to purchase power from tri state  delta and firm power from sps would also be included as generation resources to serve pnm s new mexico retail and wholesale firm requirements customers load until each contract expires under the global electric agreement 
prc approval or other authorization from the prc is not required for pnm s merchant plant investment as long as pnm meets the following conditions a pnm does not invest more than billion in merchant plant  b pnm has an investment grade credit rating on a stand alone basis and on a consolidated basis with the holding company  and c pnm spends at least million per year in gas and electric utility  non merchant plant infrastructure needed to maintain adequate and reliable service 
no prior approval for merchant plant participation would be required and expedited prc approval would be available for financing of merchant plant if certain specified financial conditions are met 
if pnm s credit rating on a stand alone or consolidated basis with the holding company falls below investment grade  however  approvals are needed for new merchant plant projects and for continuing to participate in merchant plant projects of more than certain dollar value and under certain conditions 
prc approval is not required for pnm to transfer any part of its interests in merchant plant or pvngs unit from time to time to any other legal entity  provided that the following conditions are met a pnm s debt to capital ratio will not exceed after giving effect to the transfer and b pnm s investment grade status on a stand alone basis and on a consolidated basis with the holding company will not be impaired by the transfer of merchant plant or pvngs unit at the time of transfer 
pnm further agreed in the global electric agreement that it will transfer all its interests in merchant plant out of pnm by january  pnm will accelerate the mandatory transfer to a date one year after pnm has completed expenditures of billion on merchant plant 
pnm may seek a variance from the prc at any time prior to january  to extend or vacate the time or terms and conditions requiring the transfer but not beyond january  under the global electric agreement  if merchant plant or pvngs unit is transferred to a pnm affiliate  pnm s generation resources and the affiliate s generation resources may be jointly dispatched at the merchant affiliate s sole discretion until january  joint dispatch of all utility  pvngs unit or merchant plant resources would be terminable at any time between and at pnm s discretion  as long as the utility s dispatch capability is not impaired in any way 
pnm agreed to forego recovery of the costs incurred in preparing to transition to a competitive retail market in new mexico 
this will result in a one time charge of approximately million  pre tax  in the first quarter of in the global electric agreement  pnm  prc utility staff and intervenors agreed to actively support the repeal of a majority of the restructuring act  as amended 
legislation repealing the restructuring act  as amended  and continuing authorization for utilities to participate in merchant plant for a limited time has been introduced as sb on february   sb passed the senate by a vote of it is now awaiting action in the house of representatives 
if the repeal does not occur during the new mexico legislative session  various modifications to the conditions of the global electric agreement are triggered depending on how long repeal is delayed 
in summary  the terms of this global electric agreement and the company s continuing efforts to control expenses offer significant benefits to both customers and shareholders in the form of lower rates  a predictable rate path  and the resolution of important issues affecting implementation of the company s strategic plan over the next several years 
the company is currently unable to predict the impact these proceedings may have on its plans to expand its generating capacity and its future financial condition and results of operations 
water supply there is a growing concern in new mexico about the use of water for power plants  due to the state s arid climate and current drought conditions 
the availability of sufficient water supplies to meet all the needs of the state  including growth  is a major issue 
an interim committee of the legislature refused to support legislation mandating the use of dry cooling technology 
however  legislation requiring a water conservation plan as part of an application for siting generation plants of a certain size is being considered in the session 
in building the afton and lordsburg plants  the company has secured sufficient water rights 
the four corners region  in which sjgs and four corners are located  has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants in  as well as later years if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area 
usbr is working to assess the adequacy of the water supply under pnm s usbr contract for  acre feet of water that supplies sjgs 
additionally  various stakeholders in the san juan basin  including the new mexico state engineer  are evaluating what water rights might be affected by the drought conditions  including water rights pursuant to the new mexico state permit that provide  acre feet of water to sjgs and approximately  acre feet of water for four corners 
pnm is assessing alternatives for temporary supplies of water and is working with usbr and area stakeholders to minimize the effect on operations of the plants 
pnm has assessed its situation with regard to the drought and the alternatives available to it and does not believe that its operations will be materially affected at this time 
however  pnm cannot forecast the weather situation and its ramifications with any degree of certainty or how regulators and legislators may impact pnm s situation in the future  should the drought continue 
western united states wholesale power market a significant portion of the company s earnings in was derived from the company s wholesale power marketing operations  which benefited from strong demand and high wholesale prices in the western united states 
these market conditions were driven by a number of separate factors  including electric power supply shortages in the western united states during the first half of  weather conditions  gas supply costs and transmission constraints 
as a result of these factors  the wholesale power market in the western united states became extremely volatile and  while providing many marketing opportunities  presented and continues to present significant risk to companies selling power into this marketplace 
these conditions resulted in the well publicized california energy crisis and in the bankruptcy filings of the california power exchange cal px and of pacific gas and electric company pg e  although the turmoil in the western markets was not limited to california 
however  since the third quarter of  conditions in the western wholesale power market have changed substantially as the result of certain regulatory actions see below  moderate weather conditions  conservation measures  the construction of additional generation  and a decline in natural gas prices  as well as the lingering slowdown in the regional economy 
these changes have placed and are expected to continue to place downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices 
in response to the turmoil in the western energy market  the ferc initially imposed a soft price cap of per mwh for sales to the cal px and the california independent system operator cal iso that required any wholesale sales of electricity into these markets be capped at per mwh unless the seller could demonstrate that its costs exceeded the cap 
this price cap was modified by orders of the ferc that directed certain power suppliers to provide refunds for overcharges calculated on the basis of a formula that sanctioned wholesale prices considerably in excess of the per mwh level 
shortly thereafter  the ferc adopted an order establishing prospective mitigation and a monitoring plan for the california wholesale markets and which established a further investigation of public utility rates in wholesale western energy markets 
this plan replaced the per mwh soft cap previously established and applied during periods of system emergency 
subsequently  the ferc issued still another order that changed the previous orders and expanded the price mitigation approach to the entire western region 
in july  the ferc issued further orders to address wholesale power prices in the western market 
on july  the ferc established a price cap of per mwh for the period ending september  on july  the ferc entered an order  which was to have taken effect october   raising the price cap to per mwh 
however  the ferc extended the per mwh price cap through october  according to the ferc  this price cap will spur new investment in generation and will foster the eventual return of a robust competitive marketplace 
the july order also established mechanisms to prevent power suppliers from engaging in market manipulation activities 
as a result of the foregoing conditions in the western market  the ferc and other federal and state governmental authorities are conducting investigations and other proceedings relevant to the company and other sellers 
the more significant of these in relation to the company are summarized below 
california refund proceeding by order dated june   in response to a complaint filed by san diego gas and electric company sdg e and other california buyers against sellers into the california wholesale electric market  the ferc directed one of its administrative law judges alj to convene a settlement conference to address potential refunds owed by sellers into the california market 
the settlement conference  in which pnm participated  was ultimately unsuccessful  and the alj recommended to the ferc that an evidentiary hearing be held to resolve the dispute  suggesting that refunds were due  however  the estimated refunds were significantly lower than those demanded by california  and in most instances  were offset by the amounts due suppliers from the cal px and cal iso 
the california parties had demanded refunds of approximately billion from power suppliers 
hearings on the refunds were held in september and the alj issued his proposed findings on california refund liability on december   in which he determined that the cal iso had  for the most part  calculated the amounts of the refunds correctly 
in his appendix identifying the amounts of the refunds  he identified what he termed ballpark figures for the amount of refunds due under his order 
pnm was identified as having a refund liability of approximately million  while being owed approximately million from the cal iso 
pursuant to the ferc s order  pnm filed  in conjunction with the competitive supplier group  initial comments on january  to the alj s preliminary findings addressing errors the company believes the alj made in his proposed findings and reply comments on february  prior to the december  alj decision  the ninth circuit court of appeals ordered ferc to allow the parties in the case to provide additional evidence in the case 
several california parties submitted additional evidence on march   which they argue supports their position that virtually all market participants either engaged in specific market manipulation strategies or facilitated such strategies  including pnm 
pnm maintains that it did not engage in improper wholesale trading activities 
pnm  along with other members of the competitive supplier group  will file reply evidence on march  pnm cannot predict what effect this additional evidence will have on the prior decision of the alj as to specific refund amounts 
the company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this ferc proceeding  or whether pnm will be directed to make any refunds as the result of a ferc order 
pacific northwest refund proceeding in addition to the california refund proceedings  puget sound energy  inc  filed a complaint at ferc alleging that spot market prices in the pacific northwest wholesale electric market were unjust and unreasonable 
on september   the alj issued a recommended decision and declined to order refunds associated with wholesale electric sales in the pacific northwest 
prior to the ferc acting on the alj s recommended decision  several parties joined in filing a motion at the ferc requesting the ferc to reopen the proceeding  in view of the issuance of the ferc staff s report on the enron trading strategies  to permit further investigation and discovery into transactions in the wholesale electric market in the pacific northwest 
the ferc re opened the docket to receive additional evidence from the parties 
the ferc did not remand the case to the alj  but determined to undertake themselves the review of any additional evidence in conjunction with the alj s recommended decision 
on march   puget sound and other parties submitted additional evidence to ferc alleging the existence of unlawful wholesale electric prices in the pacific northwest and that ferc should require sellers to provide refunds for spot market bilateral sales transactions in the pacific northwest 
the company believes there is nothing in this additional evidence that requires ferc to reverse the prior decision of the alj denying refunds 
the company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this ferc proceeding  or whether pnm will be directed to make any refunds as the result of an order by the ferc 
ferc investigation of enron like trading practices the ferc has also initiated a market manipulation investigation  partially in response to the bankruptcy filing of the enron corporation enron and to allegations that enron may have engaged in manipulation of portions of the western wholesale power market 
in connection with that investigation  all ferc jurisdictional and non jurisdictional sellers into western electric and gas markets have been required to submit data regarding short term transactions in pnm made its data submission on april  subsequently  in may  new enron documents came to light that raised additional concerns about enron s trading practices 
in light of these new revelations  the ferc issued additional orders in the pending investigation requiring sellers to respond to detailed questions by admitting or denying that they had engaged in trading practices similar to those practiced by enron and certain other sellers  including so called wash transactions 
the ferc issued supplemental requests for data submissions 
in its responses to the ferc requests  pnm denied that it had engaged in improper activities such as those identified in enron s memos and also denied engaging in wash transactions 
pnm admitted engaging in certain activities described in the memos that were not improper 
where appropriate  pnm s responses addressed any arguable similarities between any of its trading activities and those under investigation by the ferc 
the ferc staff has issued a preliminary report on its findings  recommending that the ferc initiate formal investigative proceedings directed at three companies and the ferc has done so 
the company was not among the companies named 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this investigation 
california power exchange and pacific gas and electric bankruptcies in january and february  sce and pg e  major purchasers of power from the cal px and cal iso  defaulted on payments due the cal px for power purchased from the cal px in these defaults caused the cal px to seek bankruptcy protection 
pg e subsequently also sought bankruptcy protection 
pnm has filed its proofs of claims in the cal px and pg e bankruptcy proceedings 
total amounts due pnm from the cal px or cal iso for power sold to them in and total approximately million 
the company has provided allowances for the total amount due from the cal px and cal iso 
california attorney general complaint in march  the california attorney general filed a complaint with the ferc against numerous sellers regarding prices for wholesale electric sales into the cal iso and cal px and to the california department of water resources cal dwr 
pnm was among the sellers identified in this complaint and filed its answer and motion to intervene 
in its answer  pnm defended its pricing and challenged the theory of liability underlying the california attorney general s complaint 
on may   the ferc entered an order denying the california attorney general s request to initiate a refund proceeding  but directed sellers  including pnm  to comply with additional reporting requirements with regard to certain wholesale power transactions 
pnm has made filings required by the may  order 
the california attorney general filed a request for rehearing contesting the ferc decision 
on september   the ferc issued its order denying the california attorney general s request for rehearing 
the california attorney general has filed a petition for review in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
pnm has intervened in the ninth circuit appeal and intends to participate as a party in that proceeding 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this appeal 
as addressed below  the california attorney general has also threatened litigation against pnm in state court in california based on similar allegations 
california attorney general threatened litigation the california attorney general has filed several lawsuits in california state court against certain power marketers for alleged unfair trade practices involving alleged overcharges for electricity 
by letter dated april   the california attorney general notified pnm of its intention to file a complaint in california state court against pnm concerning its alleged failure to file rates for wholesale electricity sold in california and for allegedly charging unjust and unreasonable rates in the california markets 
the letter invited pnm to contact the california attorney general s office before the complaint was filed  and pnm has met several times with representatives of the california attorney general s office 
further discussions are contemplated 
to date  a lawsuit has not been filed by the california attorney general and the company cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
california antitrust litigation several class action lawsuits have been filed in california state courts against electric generators and marketers  alleging that the defendants violated the law by manipulating the market to grossly inflate electricity prices 
named defendants in these lawsuits include duke energy corporation duke and related entities along with other named sellers into the california market and numerous other unidentified defendants 
these lawsuits were consolidated for hearing in state court in san diego 
in may  the duke defendants in the foregoing state court litigation served a cross claim on pnm 
duke also cross claimed against many of the other sellers into california 
duke asked for declaratory relief and for indemnification for any damages that might ultimately be imposed on duke 
several defendants removed the case to federal court 
the federal judge has entered an order remanding the matter to state court  but the filing of various procedural motions has delayed the effect of this ruling 
pnm has joined with other cross defendants in motions to dismiss the cross claim 
the company believes it has meritorious defenses but cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
block forward agreement litigation on february   pnm was served with a declaratory relief complaint filed by the state of california in california state court 
the state s declaratory relief complaint seeks a determination that the state is not liable for its commandeering of certain energy contracts known as block forward agreements 
the block forward agreements were a form of futures contracts for the purchase of electricity at below market prices and served as security for payment by pg e and sce for their electricity purchases through the cal px 
when pg e and sce defaulted on payment obligations incurred through the cal px  the cal px moved to liquidate the block forward agreements to satisfy in part the obligations owed by pg e and sce 
before the cal px could liquidate the block forward agreements  california commandeered them for its own purposes 
in march  pnm and other similarly situated sellers of electricity through the cal px filed claims for damages with the california state victims compensation and government claims board victims claims board on the theory that the state  by commandeering the block forward agreements  had deprived them of security to which they were entitled under the terms of the cal px s tariff 
the victims claims board filing was an administrative remedy that served as a mandatory prerequisite to filing suit against the state for recovery of damages related to the commandeering of the block forward agreements 
the victims claims board denied pnm s claim on march  pnm filed a complaint against the state of california in california state court on september  seeking damages for the state s commandeering of the block forward agreements and requesting judicial coordination with the state s declaratory relief action filed in february on the basis that the two actions raise essentially the same issues 
the california state court stayed the proceedings through april  pending resolution of certain related issues before the ferc 
effects of certain events on future revenues on october   western area power administration wapa filed a petition at the ferc requesting the ferc to order pnm to provide network transmission service to wapa under pnm s open access transmission tariff on behalf of the united states department of energy doe as contracting agent for kirtland air force base kafb 
on april   the ferc issued its final order directing pnm to provide the service 
the company filed an appeal of the april th order in the united states court of appeals for the th circuit 
the company  usea and wapa entered a binding memorandum of understanding resolving the dispute 
the memorandum provided that upon approval by the prc of the agreement resolving the company s electric rate path and merchant plant issues described earlier in wherever it is described  the company would dismiss its appeal at the tenth circuit and wapa would purchase from the company approximately mw of electric power that will be wheeled under the ferc final order to serve kafb 
the power sales agreement between the company and wapa was executed on february  on march  the power sales agreement went into effect and the company dismissed its appeal at the th circuit on march  due to the price difference between new mexico jurisdictional retail sales rates and the wholesale rates under the power sales agreement between the company and wapa  the loss in revenue is expected to be million per year beginning in in a separate but related proceeding  pnm and the united states executive agencies on behalf of kafb are involved in a prc case regarding a dispute over specific company tariff language under which pnm provides service to kafb 
the prc case was held in abeyance  pending the outcome of the ferc proceeding 
a status conference is scheduled before the prc hearing examiner to determine how to proceed with the case due to the dismissal of the tenth circuit appeal and implementation of the power sales agreement between wapa and the company 
new source review rules in november  the department of justice at the request of the environmental protection agency epa filed complaints against seven companies alleging the companies over the past years had made modifications to their plants in violation of the new source review nsr requirements and in some cases the new source performance standard nsps regulations  which could result in the requirement to make costly environmental additions to older power plants 
whether or not the epa will prevail is unclear at this time 
the epa has reached a settlement with one of the companies sued by the justice department 
discovery continues in the pending litigation  several of the pending cases are approaching trial  and a trial has commenced in one of the cases 
no complaint has been filed against pnm by the epa  and the company believes that all of the routine maintenance  repair  and replacement work undertaken at its power plants was and continues to be in accordance with the requirements of nsr and nsps 
however  by letter dated october   the new mexico environmental department nmed made an information request of pnm  advising pnm that the nmed was in the process of assisting the epa in the epa s nationwide effort of verifying that changes made at the country s utilities have not inadvertently triggered a modification under the clean air act s prevention of significant determination psd policies 
pnm has responded to the nmed information request 
in late june  pnm received another information request from the nmed for a list of capital projects budgeted or completed in or pnm has responded to this additional nmed information request 
the national energy policy released in may by the national energy policy development group called for a review of the pending epa enforcement actions 
as a result of that review  on june   the epa announced its intention to pursue steps to increase energy efficiency  encourage emissions reductions and make improvements and reforms to the nsr program 
the epa announced that  among other things  the nsr program had impeded or resulted in the cancellation of projects that would maintain or improve reliability  efficiency and safety of existing power plants 
the epa s june announcement contemplated further rulemakings on nsr related issues and expressly cautioned that the announcement was not intended to affect pending nsr enforcement actions 
thereafter  on december   the epa promulgated certain long awaited revisions to the nsr rules  along with proposals to revise the routine maintenance  repair and replacement exclusion contained in the regulations 
there is no specific timetable for these revisions and the ultimate resolution of nsr related issues raised by the enforcement actions remains unclear 
if the epa were to prevail in the position advanced in the pending litigation  the company may be required to make significant capital expenditures  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
citizen suit under the clean air act by letter dated january   counsel for the grand canyon trust and sierra club collectively  gct notified pnm of gct s intent to file a so called citizen suit under the clean air act  alleging that pnm and co owners of the sjgs violated the clean air act  and the implemention of federal and state regulations  at sjgs 
pursuant to that notification  on may   the gct filed suit in federal district court in new mexico against pnm but not against the other sjgs co owners

both sides in the litigation have filed motions for partial summary judgment  but the court has  to date  made no rulings on any of these matters 
a trial date on liability issues has been scheduled on a trailing docket for june based on its investigation to date  the company firmly believes that the allegations are without merit and pnm vigorously disputes the allegations 
pnm has always adhered and continues to adhere to high environmental standards as evidenced by its iso certification 
the company is  however  unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the matter 
natural gas explosion on april   a natural gas explosion occurred in santa fe  new mexico 
the apparent cause of the explosion was a leak from a pnm line near the location 
the explosion destroyed a small building and injured two persons who were working in the building 
pnm s investigation indicates that the leak was an isolated incident likely caused by a combination of corrosion and increased pressure 
pnm also cooperated with an investigation of the incident by the prc s pipeline safety bureau the bureau  which issued its report on march  the bureau s report gave pnm notice of probable violations of the new mexico pipeline safety act and related regulations 
pnm and the bureau staff entered a compliance agreement addressing the probable violations and filed it with the prc for approval on march  pnm agreed to undertake a list of twenty four corrective actions  including internal policy changes  retraining employees and enhancing gas line monitoring

new and proposed accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas sfas requires the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction or development and or the normal operations of the long lived assets 
retirement obligations associated with long lived assets included within the scope of sfas are those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws  statutes  written or oral contracts  including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel 
under the standard  the asset retirement obligation aro liability is recognized at its fair value as incurred 
the recognition of an aro results in an increase in the carrying cost of the long lived asset  which will be amortized using a systematic and rationale basis over the remaining life of the related asset as depreciation expense 
an aro represents a future liability and  as a result  accretion expense will be accrued on this liability until such time as the obligation is satisfied 
accretion of the aro liability due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense 
if at the end of the asset s life the recorded liability differs from the actual settled obligation  the company may incur a gain or loss that will be recognized at that time 
the net difference between the amounts determined under sfas and the company s previous method of accounting for such activities net of expected regulatory recovery  will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of related income taxes 
the company is currently calculating the liability associated with its aros but does not believe there will be a material effect on continuing operations for the adoption of this standard 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no

 and technical corrections sfas 
in april  the fasb issued sfas this statement updates and clarifies existing accounting pronouncements for the treatment of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and eliminates an inconsistency between required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have similar economic effects as sale leaseback transactions 
in accordance with previous accounting standards  gains and losses from extinguishment of debt were classified as extraordinary gains and losses 
the current statement permits gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be classified as ordinary and included in income from operations  unless they are unusual in nature or occur infrequently and therefore included as an extraordinary item 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  for the provisions related to the rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  and for all transactions entered into after may  for the provision related to the amendments of fasb statement no 
the company does not believe there will be a material effect from the adoption of this standard on the company s consolidated statements of financial position or results of operations

it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying obligation that is related to an asset  liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the guarantor s previous accounting for guarantees issued prior to the date of initial application should not be revised or restated 
the company adopted fin  and such adoption did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements fin 
in january  the fasb issued fin to address the consolidation of variable interest entities that have one or both of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity and the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  which makes it possible for the entity to finance its activities  or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur  which is the compensation for the risk of absorbing the expected losses 
fasb believes that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included in consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
fin requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
there are also additional disclosure requirements for an enterprise that holds significant variable interests in a variable interest entity but is not the primary beneficiary 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date and may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
currently  the company does not have interests in any variable interest entity 
eitf issues related to accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  eitf accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
on october   the eitf reached a final consensus on eitf that rescinds eitf and requires that all energy contracts held for trading purposes be presented on a net margin basis in the statement of earnings 
the rescission of eitf requires that energy contracts which do not meet the definition of a derivative under sfas no longer be marked to market and recognized in current earnings 
as a result  all contracts which were marked to market under eitf and must now be accounted for under the accrual method should be written back to cost with any difference included as a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of adoption 
this transition provision will be effective for the first quarter of the rescission of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations as all contracts previously marked to market under the definition provided in eitf also met the definition of a derivative under sfas and are properly recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in earnings 
the company is reviewing its energy contract portfolio to determine whether its contracts meet the definition of trading activities under eitf which should be presented on a net margin basis 
the company will reclassify prior periods to a net margin basis for those contracts previously accounted for under eitf in the first quarter of the company does not expect to report revenues and cost of energy sold on a net margin basis on a prospective basis as a result of the application of eitf as none of the of company s marketing activities meet the definitions of trading activities as prescribed by eitf disclosure regarding forward looking statements statements made in this filing that relate to future events are made pursuant to the private securities litigation reform act of readers are cautioned that all forward looking statements are based upon current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties 
the company assumes no obligation to update this information 
because actual results may differ materially from expectations  the company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on these statements 
future financial results will be affected by a number of factors  including interest rates  weather  fuel costs  changes in supply and demand in the market for electric power  wholesale power prices  market liquidity  the competitive environment in the electric and natural gas industries  the performance of generating units and transmission system  state and federal regulatory and legislative decisions and actions  and the performance of state  regional and national economies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage risk as it relates to changes in natural gas and electric prices  changes in interest rates and  historically  adverse market changes for investments held by the company s various trusts 
the company also uses certain derivative instruments for wholesale power marketing transactions in order to take advantage of favorable price movements and market timing activities in the wholesale power markets 
the following additional information is provided 
risk management the company controls the scope of its various forms of risk through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures and oversight by senior level management and the holding company board of directors 
the board s finance committee sets the risk limit parameters 
the risk management committee rmc  comprised of corporate and business segment officers and other managers  oversees all of the activities  which include commodity price  credit  equity  interest rate and business risks 
the rmc has oversight for the ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the risk control organization and policies 
the company has a risk control organization  headed by the director of financial risk management risk manager  which is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies  procedures and limits and evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions  on an enterprise wide basis 
the rmc s responsibilities specifically include establishment of a general policy regarding risk exposure levels and activities in each of the business segments  recommendation of the types of instruments permitted  authority to establish a general policy regarding counterparty exposure and limits  authorization and delegation of transaction limits  review and approval of controls and procedures  review and approval of models and assumptions used to calculate mark to market and risk exposure  authority to approve and open brokerage and counterparty accounts  review of hedging and risk activities  and quarterly reporting to the finance committee and the board of directors on these activities 
the rmc also proposes value at risk var limits to the finance committee 
the finance committee ultimately sets the aggregate var limit 
it is the responsibility of each business unit to create its own control procedures and policies within the parameters established by the finance committee 
the rmc reviews and approves these policies  which are created with the assistance of the chief accounting officer  director of internal audit and the risk manager 
each business unit s policies address the following controls authorized risk exposure limits  authorized instruments and markets  authorized personnel  policies on segregation of duties  policies on mark to market accounting  responsibilities for deal capture  confirmation procedures  responsibilities for reporting results  statement on the role of derivative transactions  and limits on individual transaction size nominal value 
to the extent an open position exists  fluctuating commodity prices can impact financial results and financial position  either favorably or unfavorably 
as a result  the company cannot predict with precision the impact that its risk management decisions may have on its businesses  operating results or financial position 
commodity risk marketing and procurement of energy often involves market risks associated with managing energy commodities and establishing open positions in the energy markets  primarily on a short term basis 
these risks fall into three different categories price and volume volatility  credit risk of counterparties and adequacy of the control environment 
pnm routinely enters into forward contracts and options to hedge purchase and sale commitments  fuel requirements and to minimize the risk of market fluctuations on the generation and marketing operations 
the company s wholesale power marketing operations  including both long term contracts and merchant sales activities  are managed through an asset backed marketing strategy  whereby pnm s aggregate net open forward contract position is covered by its own excess generation capabilities 
pnm is exposed to market risk if its generation capabilities were disrupted or if its retail load requirements were greater than anticipated 
if pnm were required to cover all or a portion of its net open contract position  it would have to meet its commitments through market purchases 
under the derivative accounting rules and the related accounting rules for energy contracts  the company accounts for its various financial derivative instruments for the purchase and sale of energy differently based on management s intent when entering into the contract 
energy contracts which meet the definition of a derivative under sfas and do not qualify for a normal purchase or sale designation are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value at each period end 
the changes in fair market value are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
should an energy transaction qualify as a hedge  fair market value changes from year to year are recognized on the balance sheet with a corresponding charge to other comprehensive income 
gains or losses are recognized when the hedged transaction occurs 
normal purchases and sales are not marked to market but rather recorded in results of operations when the underlying transaction occurs 
intentionally left blank the following table shows how the net fair value of mark to market energy contracts was derived from the amounts included in the balance sheet year ended december  in thousands mark to market energy contracts current asset   long term asset  total mark to market assets   current liability   long term liability  total mark to market liabilities   net fair value of mark to market energy contracts  the mark to market energy portfolio positions at december  and december  represent net liabilities after netting all open purchase and sale contracts 
because the contractual amounts required to settle the open net liability were greater than the current market values of the contracts  the company recorded a net loss position in and  however  the settlement of certain of these transactions in and changes in market prices significantly reduced the loss position and resulted in the recognition of a mark to market gain 
the market prices used to value pnm s mark to market energy portfolio are based on closing exchange prices and over the counter quotations 
as of december  and december   pnm did not have any outstanding contracts that were valued using methods other than quoted prices 
the company did not change its methods for valuing its mark to market energy portfolio in as compared to the following table provides detail of changes in the company s mark to market energy portfolio net asset or liability balance sheet position from one period to the next year ended december  in thousands sources of fair value gain loss fair value at beginning of year   amount realized on contracts delivered during period   changes in fair value   net fair value at end of period  net change recorded as mark to market   this table provides the maturity of the net assets liabilities of the company  giving an indication of when these mark to market amounts will settle and generate use cash fair value at december  maturities less than sources of fair value year years total in thousands mark to market energy contracts  note all values determined using broker quotes 
as of december   a decrease in market pricing of pnm s mark to market energy portfolio by would have resulted in a decrease in net earnings of less than 
conversely  an increase in market pricing of this portfolio by would have resulted in an increase in net earnings of less than at december   the market value of pnm s normal sales and purchases of electricity was a million asset using the valuation methods described above 
if these transactions did not meet the definition of normal under the accounting rules for derivatives  the company would have recognized unrealized gains of million as an adjustment to generation and marketing operating revenues based on the change in fair value of these contracts from january  to december  the company assesses the risk of these long term contracts and merchant sales activities using the var method to maintain the company s total exposure within management prescribed limits 
the company utilizes the variance covariance model of var  which is a probabilistic model that measures the risk of loss to earnings in market sensitive instruments 
the variance covariance model relies on statistical relationships to analyze how changes in different markets can affect a portfolio of instruments with different characteristics and market exposure 
var models are relatively sophisticated  however  the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model 
the instruments being evaluated may trigger a potential loss in excess of calculated amounts if changes in commodity prices exceed the confidence level of the model used 
the var methodology employs the following critical parameters volatility estimates  market values of open positions  appropriate market oriented holding periods and seasonally adjusted correlation estimates 
the company s var calculation only considers the company s forward position for the proceeding eighteen months 
the company uses a holding period of three days as the estimate of the length of time that will be needed to liquidate the positions 
the volatility and the correlation estimates measure the impact of adverse price movements both at an individual position level as well as at the total portfolio level 
the confidence level established is 
for example  if var is calculated at million  it is estimated at a confidence level that if prices move against pnm s positions  the company s pre tax gain or loss in liquidating the portfolio would not exceed million in the three days that it would take to liquidate the portfolio 
the company s var is regularly monitored by the company s rmc 
the rmc has put in place procedures to ensure that increases in var are reviewed and  if deemed necessary  acted upon to reduce exposures 
the var represents an estimate of the potential gains or losses that could be recognized on pnm s wholesale power marketing portfolios given current volatility in the market  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  as well as changes to pnm s wholesale power marketing portfolios during the year 
the company accounts for the sale of electric generation in excess of its retail needs or the purchase of power for retail needs as normal purchases and sales under sfas purchases for resale and subsequent resales are accounted for as energy trading contracts in accordance with eitf and comprise pnm s mark to market portfolio 
the var for the mark to market portfolio was  at december  the company also calculates a portfolio var  which in addition to its mark to market portfolio includes all contracts designated as normal sales and purchases  hedges  and its estimated excess generation assets 
this excess is determined using average peak forecasts for the respective block of power in the forward market 
the company s portfolio var was million at december  the following table shows the high  average and low market risk as measured by var on the company s mark to market portfolio three day holding period  two tailed confidence level year ended december  high average low in thousands credit risk pnm is exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance or non payment by counterparties 
the company uses a credit management process to assess and monitor the financial conditions of counterparties 
credit exposure is also regularly monitored by the rmc 
the company provides for losses due to market and credit risk 
pnm s credit risk with its largest counterparty as of december  was million 
in  in response to the increased credit risk and market price volatility described above  the company provided an allowance against revenue of million for anticipated losses to reflect management s estimate of the increased market and credit risk in the wholesale power market and its impact on revenues 
as of december   million was transferred to the allowance for bad debt 
the company reduced its reserves by million for the year ended december  as a result of a lack of market liquidity  lower prices and lower volatility 
based on information available at december   the company believes the total allowance for anticipated losses exclusive of bad debt  currently established at million  is adequate for management s estimate of losses from credit risk 
the company will continue to monitor the wholesale power marketplace and adjust its estimates accordingly 
the following table provides information related to pnm s credit exposure  net of collateral as of december  it further delineates that exposure by the credit worthiness credit rating of the counterparties and provides guidance as to the concentration of credit risk to individual counterparties pnm may have 
schedule of wholesale power marketing credit risk exposure december  net exposure number exposure before of of credit credit counter counter collateral collateral net exposure parties parties rating a b c dollars in thousands investment grade    non investment grade   split rating internal ratings investment grade non investment grade    total    credit reserves  a rating included in investment grade are counterparties with a minimum standard poor s rating of bbb or moody s rating of baa if the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity eg  its parent  determination is based on the rating of its guarantor 
the internal ratings investment grade includes those counterparties that are internally rated as investment grade in accordance with the guidelines established in the company s credit policy 
b the exposure before credit collateral is the net credit exposure to pnm from its wholesale power marketing activities 
this includes long term contracts and other merchant sales and purchases 
the exposure captures the net amounts due to pnm from receivables payables for realized transactions  delivered and unbilled revenues  and mark to market gains losses pursuant to contract terms 
exposures are offset according to legally enforceable netting arrangements 
amounts are presented before those reserves that are determined on a portfolio basis 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations western united states wholesale power market for discussion of the reserves 
c the credit collateral reflects the face amount of cash deposits  letters of credit and performance bonds received from counterparties 
pnm hedges certain portions of natural gas supply contracts in order to protect its retail customers from adverse price fluctuations in the natural gas market 
the financial impact of all hedge gains and losses  including the related costs of the program  is recoverable through the purchased gas adjustment clause 
as a result  earnings are not affected by gains and losses generated by these instruments 
interest rate risk as of december   the company has an investment portfolio of fixed rate government obligations and corporate securities  which were subject to the risk of loss  associated with movements in market interest rates 
for accounting purposes  the portfolio is classified as available for sale and is marked to market 
as a result  unrealized losses resulting from interest rate increases are recorded as a component of comprehensive income 
if interest rates were to rise basis points from their levels at december   the fair value of these instruments would decline by or million 
in addition  because of this interest rate sensitivity  early or unplanned redemption of these investments in a period of increasing interest rates would subject the company to risk of a realized loss of principal as the fair market value of these investments would be less than their carrying value 
the company employs investment managers to mitigate this risk 
as part of its investing strategies  the company has diversified its portfolio with investments of varying maturity and obligors and limits credit exposure to high investment grade quality investments 
pnm has long term debt which subjects it to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
all of the company s long term debt is fixed rate debt  and therefore  does not expose the company s earnings to a risk of loss due to adverse changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these debts instruments would increase by approximately or million if interest rates were to decline by basis points from their levels at december  as of december   the fair value of pnm s long term debt was million as compared to a book value of million 
in general  an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows if pnm were to re acquire all or a portion of its debt instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
certain issuances of the debt have call dates in december and august to hedge against the risk of rising interest rates and their impact on the economics of calling the debt  pnm has entered into forward starting interest rate swaps in and these forward interest rate swaps effectively lock in interest rates for the notional amount of the debt that is callable at a rate of approximately plus an adjustment for pnm s and the industry s credit ratings 
at december   the fair market value of these derivative financial instruments was approximately million unfavorable to the company 
pnm contributed million in to a trust established to fund decommissioning costs for pvngs 
in january  pnm contributed million for plan year to the trust for the company s pension plan  and other post retirement benefits 
additional contributions were made in september for million and in december for million for the plan year 
the securities held by the trusts had an estimated fair value of million as of december   of which approximately were fixed rate debt securities that subject the company to risk of loss of fair value with movements in market interest rates 
if rates were to increase by basis points from their levels at december   the decrease in the fair value of the securities would be or million 
pnm does not currently recover or return through rates any losses or gains on these securities  therefore  the company is at risk for shortfalls in its funding of its obligations due to investment losses 
however  the company does not believe that long term market returns over the period of funding will be less than required for the company to meet its obligations 
for further information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pension and other post retirement benefits 
equity market risk as discussed above under interest rate risk  pnm contributes to trusts established to fund its share of the decommissioning costs of pvngs and pension and other post retirement benefits 
the trusts hold certain equity securities as of december  these equity securities also expose the company to losses in fair value 
approximately of the securities held by the various trusts were equity securities as of december  similar to the debt securities held for funding decommissioning and certain pension and other post retirement costs  pnm does not recover or earn a return on through rates  any losses or gains on these equity securities 
for further information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pension and other post retirement benefits 
in  the company implemented an enhanced cash management strategy using derivative instruments based on the standard poor s  s p  and nasdaq composite indices 
the strategy is designed to capitalize on high market volatility or benefit from market direction 
an investment manager is utilized to execute the program 
the program is carefully managed by the rmc and has var and stop loss limits established 
trades are typically closed out before the end of a reporting period and within the same day of execution 
there were no open positions as of december
