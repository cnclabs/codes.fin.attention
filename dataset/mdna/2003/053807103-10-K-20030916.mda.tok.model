item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  and other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
the severe economic downturn in the technology markets in which the company competes is a material contributor to the financial results discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
due to the severity and length of the downturn in the electronic component and computer product industry and in the global economy as a whole  the company has recorded numerous charges in recent years that are discussed more fully in restructuring and other charges in this md a 
these charges have had a significant impact on the company s results of operations in each of the years presented in this report as discussed further below 
in addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  the company also discloses pro forma or non gaap measures that may exclude certain items 
management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand operating performance  especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods 
management believes the pro forma measures also help indicate underlying trends in the business 
management also uses pro forma information to establish operational goals and  in some cases  for measuring performance for compensation purposes 
however  analysis of results and outlook on a pro forma or non gaap basis should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  data presented in accordance with gaap 
please note that unless otherwise specifically indicated  references herein to any particular year or quarter generally are to the company s fiscal year periods 
the company s fiscal year ends on the friday closest to june saturday closest to june commencing in 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon the company s continuous evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting polices as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes the company s most critical accounting policies relate to valuation of receivables the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customer defaults 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as the company s regular assessment of the financial condition of its customers valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in first out or estimated market value 
the company s inventories include high technology components  embedded systems and computing technologies sold into rapidly changing  cyclical and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company regularly evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories less marketable 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers  which provide certain protections to the company for product obsolescence and price erosion in the form of rights of return and price protection 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process 
table of contents around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  management would evaluate whether additional write downs of inventories are required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net foreign operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
in addition  the company considers historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an additional valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
restructuring and integration charges the company has been subject to the financial impact of integrating acquired businesses and charges related to business reorganizations 
in connection with such events  management is required to make estimates about the financial impact of such matters that are inherently uncertain 
accrued liabilities and reserves are established to cover the cost of severance  facility consolidation and closure  lease termination fees  inventory adjustments based upon acquisition related termination of supplier agreements and or the re evaluation of the acquired working capital assets inventory and accounts receivable  change in control expenses  and write down of other acquired assets including goodwill 
actual amounts incurred could be different from those estimated 
additionally  in assessing the company s goodwill for impairment in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to make significant assumptions about the future cash flows and overall performance of its reporting units 
should these assumptions or the structure of the reporting units change in the future based upon market conditions or changes in business strategy  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges to its remaining goodwill 
see change in accounting principle goodwill in this md a for further discussion of sfas and the company s transitional and annual impairment tests 
contingencies and litigation the company is involved in various legal proceedings and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters  all of which arise in the normal course of business 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome to these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis by management and internal and  when necessary  external counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to developments or a change in circumstances 
changes to reserves could increase or decrease earnings in the period the changes are effective 
the company does not consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy due to the nature of its business in which revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally these criteria are met upon the actual shipment of product to the customer 
accordingly  other than for estimates related to possible returns of products from customers  discounts or rebates  the recording of revenue does not require significant judgments or estimates 
furthermore  revenues from maintenance contracts  which are deferred and recognized to income over the life of the agreement  and revenues and anticipated profits from long term contracts  which are recorded on a percentage of completion basis  are not material to the consolidated results of operations of the company 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
eitf provides guidance as to the classification and timing of recognition of supplier rebates in the results of operations of the customer or reseller receiving the rebate 
substantially all of avnet s rebates are dependent on the resale of the product to avnet s customers and the rebates are typically not awarded until avnet completes this sale 
avnet has historically accounted for these rebates as a reduction of cost of sales and  therefore  eitf did not have a material impact on the company 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires the consolidation of variable interest entities vies  as defined  based upon an assessment of a company s investment interests in the vie as it relates to the interests of other investors in the vie 
fin also includes certain disclosure requirements related to any vies 
the consolidation requirements apply to any vies created after january  and  for any vies that existed prior to that date  the consolidation requirements are effective with avnet s first quarter of fiscal to the extent avnet continues to hold an investment interest in any such vies as of the first day of that quarter 
the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively and  therefore  will have no impact on pre existing hedging transactions 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for classification and measurement of certain financial instruments 
sfas is effective for any financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and avnet adopted sfas  as required  for any previously existing financial instruments as of june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions and investments for an overview of the company s acquisitions over the past three years  see item  business  and see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
management currently does not anticipate making any material acquisitions in the near term 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of certain material acquisitions on the financial results of the company 
results from operations the results for reflect a relatively stable but continuing weak technology market as the electronic components and computer products industry  and the global economy in general  continue to try to recover from the downturn that commenced after the company s second quarter of this downturn has had a significant impact on the company s results from operations in all periods presented herein 
the downturn is primarily a consequence of several economic and geopolitical forces weakened financial markets following the collapse of the dot com industry and other recent significant business failures  weak global demand for it capital equipment following the yk and dot com infrastructure buildup  a severe oversupply of electronic components  and an uncertain geopolitical climate 
these events have impacted  to varying degrees  all facets of the technology markets in which the company competes  resulting in suppressed demand which has been compounded by pricing pressures within the supply chain  a common effect to the industry in a downturn such 
table of contents as this 
the only exception has been the relatively strong revenue growth of the asia region  which continues to be the recipient of a global shift in technology manufacturing  much of it away from the americas region 
while the impacts of this downturn on avnet s business have been consistent across the industry  avnet has continued to focus on lowering its cost structure and its working capital in an effort to generate profits and to strengthen its balance sheet despite relatively flat revenue performance 
as a result  during the company has seen positive signs of returning to profitability following the significant deterioration in sales and operating income loss during sales the tables below provide a year over year summary of sales for the company and its operating groups three year group analysis of sales by operating group and geography years ended percent change june  of june  of june  of to to total total total dollars in millions sales by operating group em cm ac sales by geographic area americas emea asia consolidated sales for of billion were up slightly by million  or  compared to consolidated sales of billion  primarily due to strengthening of the euro 
as discussed above  this flat revenue performance is largely indicative of an electronic components and computer products industry that has stabilized after the precipitous decline midway through the relatively small growth in sales year over year is largely a result of modest increases in sales within em and cm offset  in part  by declines in sales within ac 
em s sales of billion in were up million  or  over em s sales of billion 
the largest growth within em occurred in the asia region where em s sales were million  up million  or  over em asia sales of million 
this growth in asia is indicative of the trend whereby technology manufacturing continues to shift to this region of the world  especially in the electronic component industry in which em competes 
also impacting em s net increase in sales year over year was the strength of the euro in em emea s sales increased to billion in from billion in an increase of million  or 
much of the shift to asia discussed above continues to come from the americas  where em s sales of billion were down million  or  from em americas sales 
em americas has also seen more pricing pressure than the other regions as  despite relatively flat year over year unit volume  average selling prices have declined in although this decline in average selling prices is not expected to be a permanent trend  the most significant impact during has been on ip e and rf microwave products where revenues were down approximately and  respectively 
cm s sales of billion in improved by million  or  over cm s sales of billion in trends in cm s sales are primarily a function of the group s performance in the americas region  which has consistently accounted for more than of cm s global sales in recent years 
cm americas sales were billion in  up million  or  over cm americas sales of billion 
cm s growth in 
table of contents the americas is driven in large part by growth in the enterprise computing and storage markets offset  in part  by continued reduced activity in the telecommunications and networking sectors 
cm s emea and asia sales of million and million  respectively  were down and up in comparison to results 
ac s sales were billion  down million  or  from sales of billion 
this reduction is primarily a result of ac s continued focus on higher margin oems while reducing its customer relationships in the highly competitive  low margin pc builder market in all regions 
ac americas sales of million in were down million  or  from this decline was somewhat offset by sales within ac emea of million  which were up over  primarily on the strength of the euro  and sales within ac asia of million  which were up over sales  primarily due to the migration of some business to the asia region  similar to the effect on em s business discussed above 
as discussed further in restructuring and other charges  the company announced subsequent to that it would combine the cm and ac operations on a global basis  which is expected to result in the elimination of certain duplicative executive and support functions no material eliminations in sales and marketing positions are anticipated  the closing of certain logistics operations in the americas and emea and the elimination of certain duplicative it platforms 
this combination is not expected to result in any material reduction in sales for the combined enterprises 
cm and ac combined generated revenues in of billion  or of consolidated sales as compared to combined revenues of billion  or of consolidated sales  in the company completed with sales of billion  down  or billion  from the record sales of billion recorded in as discussed above  the decrease in consolidated sales was due primarily to the confluence of global and domestic economic forces that caused the severe downturn in the technology markets the company serves 
em sales were most significantly impacted as this group reported sales of billion in  down billion  or  from sales of billion 
the drop within em is directly attributable to the global decline in semiconductor sales in consistent with the semiconductor industry as a whole  which experienced its worst performance in annual revenue trends in calendar cm sales of billion were down million  or  from levels primarily due to similar macro economic factors as discussed above 
ac sales of billion in increased marginally by from due primarily to growth in its european operations affected  in part  by a full year of operations of rke systems in  acquired as part of the veba group acquisition discussed in item of this report as well as marginally positive growth in asia 
restructuring and other charges the company recorded a number of restructuring and other charges during the last three fiscal years 
these charges relate primarily to three items charges stemming from acquisition and integration of newly acquired businesses  charges to record impairment in the company s internet related investments and the reorganization of operations in each of the three major regions of the world in which the company operates  generally taken in response to business conditions at the time of the charge 
the company also recorded a charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  which is further discussed in change in accounting principle goodwill in this md a  and debt extinguishment costs associated with the company s redemption of certain outstanding debt obligations  which is further discussed in liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents the following table summarizes the charges recorded in  and summary of restructuring and other charges after tax pre tax after tax per diluted year quarter category charge charge share impact thousands  except per share amounts q debt extinguishment costs   q reorganization charges   total for year   q write down of certain acquired kent assets  reorganization charges   impairment of internet investments   total for year   q kent acquisition and integration costs   reorganization charges   impairment of internet investments   total for year   see also note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report for a detail of activity within the restructuring and other charge accounts during the past three years 
during the second quarter of  the company executed certain actions as part of its ongoing cost reduction initiatives and  accordingly  recorded charges totaling million pre tax  million after tax  or per diluted share 
the entire pre tax charge was included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the charge consisted of severance costs million pre tax  charges related to the consolidation of selected facilities million pre tax and charges related to certain it related initiatives million pre tax 
severance costs and charges related to the consolidation of selected facilities were taken in response to the current business environment 
during the second quarter  management identified a number of facilities in each of the company s operating segments and its corporate functions  which covered each of the company s geographic regions  to be consolidated into other facilities 
due primarily to the significant reductions in personnel discussed below  the facilities were identified in an effort to combine certain logistics and administrative operations wherever possible and eliminate what would otherwise be duplicative costs 
the charges related to reserves for remaining non cancelable lease obligations  write downs of the carrying value of certain owned facilities to market value and write downs to fair market value of owned assets located in these leased and owned facilities that have been vacated 
all facilities identified for consolidation had been vacated by the end of the third quarter of workforce reductions at these and other facilities worldwide resulted in the termination of approximately personnel as part of the second quarter reorganization plan 
the impacted personnel were primarily in non customer facing positions 
also during the second quarter of fiscal  management evaluated and elected to discontinue a number of it related initiatives that  in light of recent business restructurings  no longer met the company s return on investment standards for continued use or development 
these charges relate to the write off of capitalized hardware  software and software licenses all non cash charges and reserves for remaining lease commitments on leased hardware and software which will no longer be utilized by the company s operations in light of the decisions made and the reorganizations completed as discussed above 
during the fourth quarter of  the company executed certain additional actions that resulted in charges totaling million pre tax 
the incremental impact of these actions was substantially offset by certain adjustments that the company recorded  also in the fourth quarter of  primarily relating to 
table of contents certain of the charges recorded in the second quarter of the new charge activity  mostly for severance and consolidation of selected facilities  related to each of the company s three operating groups and its corporate functions in the americas and emea regions 
the additional census reductions totaled approximately and resulted primarily from em s decision to combine its cilicon and rf and microwave sales divisions  and ac s decision to reduce its participation in certain market segments where profitability of the products in question have not yielded acceptable economic returns to the company 
the fourth quarter adjustments to prior restructuring and other charges reflect changes in estimates from the time the charges and applicable reserves were initially recorded  relating to reserves for severance and for leases and other contractual commitments that were determined to be excessive during the fourth quarter based upon payments made or still to be made and or based upon more favorable than anticipated sublease or lease buyout arrangements  and an adjustment  based upon estimated sales price net of costs to sell as derived from current market studies and comparable sales  of a portion of a write down that was recorded in the second quarter of related to an owned facility that was vacated and classified as held for sale during that quarter 
of the charges  million remains unexpended at june  relating primarily to severance costs  substantially all of which is expected to be utilized during the first quarter of  contractual lease commitments  substantially all of which is expected to be utilized by the end of  and remaining payments on the it related contracts discussed above  substantially all of which is expected to be utilized during the first quarter of the restructuring charges discussed above are expected to yield annualized cost reductions of approximately million 
substantially all of these costs have been removed from the business as of the end of so the full impact of these efforts should be felt in the results of operations for subsequent to  the company announced certain additional restructuring and cost cutting initiatives in response to the ongoing downturn in the technology industry 
the resulting anticipated charges can be broken into three categories the combination of cm and ac  which the company announced in july see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report  which is expected to result in the elimination of certain duplicative executive and support functions no material eliminations in sales and marketing positions are anticipated  the closing of certain warehousing and logistics operations in the americas and emea and the elimination of certain duplicative it platforms  the reorganization of the company s global it resources  which are currently administered generally on a separate basis within each of the company s operating groups  which is expected to result in elimination of certain it related positions globally in addition to the write off of certain it related assets  and various other reductions within em and within centralized support functions  which are expected to include certain census reductions  primarily in non customer facing positions  and the consolidation of certain administrative facilities 
these reduction efforts  most of which are expected to be completed during  are expected to result in additional charges of approximately million  roughly half of which are expected to be cash charges 
management anticipates cost savings to the company from these reduction efforts will be approximately million annually  most of which should be completed by the end of the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded charges representing a write down in value of certain assets acquired in the acquisition of kent and certain other charges taken in response to business conditions 
the charge totaled million pre tax million included in cost of sales and million included in operating expenses and million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis 
the kent related items resulted from the acquisition of kent being accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting for the acquisition 
these items relate specifically to assets or obligations that were on the books of kent at the acquisition and  therefore  under the pooling of interests method  these items that normally would have been reflected as adjustments to goodwill if the purchase method of accounting could have been used were instead recorded to the company s consolidated statement of operations 
these items amounted to million pre tax and relate primarily to write downs to the value of receivables considered uncollectible after the company had exhausted efforts of collecting these 
table of contents amounts from kent s pre acquisition customers million pre tax  excess and obsolete inventory  primarily for customer specific inventory held by kent at the acquisition date that was subsequently determined  through ongoing negotiations with the customers  to require a write down to net realizable value million pre tax  and charges to record additional write downs to approximate fair market value on held for sale properties acquired in the kent acquisition or to record lease reserves for non cancelable lease obligations on properties the company committed to exit million pre tax  approximately million pre tax in cash recoveries of certain charges recorded as part of the restructuring and integration charges taken in the fourth quarter of the remaining pre tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of  which amounted to million  included an impairment charge of million pre tax to write down certain of the company s investments in unconsolidated internet related businesses to their fair market value and million pre tax for severance charges taken for workforce reductions  primarily in the americas region  with more limited reductions in emea and asia  totaling approximately individuals 
the impairments recorded to the company s internet related investments are considered capital losses for tax purposes and are therefore only deductible to the extent the company has available capital gains 
at that time  there were no capital gains  available or forecasted in the foreseeable future  to offset these losses 
therefore  the company generally did not record a tax benefit for these losses 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded restructuring and integration charges in connection with the acquisition and integration of kent and for costs related to actions taken in response to business conditions and other restructuring activity 
the charge amounted to million pre tax million included in cost of sales and million included in operating expenses and million after tax  or per share on a diluted basis 
approximately million of the pre tax charge resulted from the acquisition of kent having been accounted for using the pooling of interests method as discussed above 
these items consisted of costs incurred in completing the acquisition including significant change in control and other executive benefit related payments made as a result of the acquisition million pre tax  professional fees for investment banking  legal and accounting services rendered to both avnet and kent million pre tax  as well as adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed million pre tax 
the adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were primarily recorded as a result of the company s efforts to realize certain synergies of the combined kent avnet operations 
in order to achieve such cost savings in the combined enterprise  elimination of certain duplicative positions  facilities and inventory was required 
these charges included accruals for severance for approximately employees terminated million pre tax  write downs of receivables considered uncollectible million pre tax  inventory write downs related to termination of non strategic product lines million pre tax  write downs associated with the disposal of fixed assets million pre tax  lease terminations million pre tax and other items million pre tax 
the balance of the pre tax charge recorded in the fourth quarter of  amounting to million  related to a number of actions taken to cope with market conditions and to strengthen avnet s operations 
these actions included cost reductions associated with the reorganization of the company s business  the integration of recent acquisitions  as well as cost cutting actions taken in response to business conditions 
these charges fall into a number of categories including severance for the elimination of approximately employees  related to the company s em  cm and corporate operations in all three global regions million pre tax  inventory write downs related to terminations of non strategic product lines million pre tax  inventory valuation adjustments for special inventory purchases to meet customer requirements which are in excess of what is anticipated to be sold or returned million pre tax  write downs associated with the disposal of fixed assets million pre tax  lease terminations million pre tax  adjustments to the book value of investments in unconsolidated entities million pre tax and other items million pre tax 
the unusually large impact on after tax income related to this charge is due primarily to the non deductibility of certain acquisition related costs and the impact of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 

table of contents of the and charges  which totaled million pre tax  million remains unexpended at june  which relates primarily to severance  substantially all of which is scheduled to be utilized by the end of the second quarter of  and contractual lease commitments  substantially all of which is expected to be utilized by the end of gross profit and gross profit margins consolidated gross profit for was billion  representing a gross profit margin of  down from billion in  or 
gross profit in includes million of restructuring charges discussed above which reduced the reported gross profit margin in that year by basis points 
the decline in consolidated gross profit margins year over year was primarily attributable to the mix of business amongst the company s operating groups  including the negative impact of lower gross profit margin computer product sales in  as well as the mix of product sales within the operating groups  especially a greater volume of software sales within cm which yield a lower margin while also bearing a low cost of capital thus making software sales an attractive market to the company despite the lower margins 
em s gross profit margins improved in even with the previously discussed migration of technology manufacturing to the asia region  where margins have traditionally been lower than in other regions of the world 
cm experienced continued changes in product mix and competitive pricing  most notably in the computer hardware and storage markets markets that also bear a low cost of capital  similar to software discussed above  which exacerbated the decline in gross profit margins within this business 
additionally  as discussed in restructuring and other charges above  ac continued to exit customer relationships in the low margin pc builder segment which resulted in improved gross profit margins for this operating group in the fourth quarter of nevertheless  the group still experienced depressed margins on a year over year comparison 
ac s efforts in this area yielded gross profit margin improvement to a high for the year of in the fourth quarter of consolidated gross profit margins were in as compared to in cost of sales in these years included the impact of restructuring and other charges totaling million and million  respectively  which negatively impacted gross profit margins by basis points in and basis points in the decline in gross profit margin in from the prior year illustrated the difficult market environment and pressure on average selling prices across the operating groups 
the downward trend also included the effect of product mix increased sales of computer products including microprocessors  drams  disk drives  etc 
that generally have lower gross profit margins than other products in the company s product lines 
the impact of these factors on the company s gross profit margins was mitigated in part by the company s efforts  beginning in late  to expand its presence with customers who utilize more of the company s value added services and in end market segments that provide generally higher gross profit margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses and operating income loss selling  general and administrative expenses were billion  or of sales  in as compared to billion  or of sales  in included in and operating expenses are restructuring and other charges discussed above totaling million of sales in and million of sales in the million improvement in operating expenses year over year  despite also recording million more of restructuring and other charges in compared to  is a function of the company s extensive cost reduction efforts in all facets of its business 
this improvement is offset in part by the value of the euro  which strengthened compared to the us dollar throughout the majority of 
table of contents the fourth quarter of was the first quarter in which the company benefited from the entire impact of restructuring efforts in both the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of operating expenses in the fourth quarter of were million  which  annualized  represents a run rate of approximately billion 
by comparison  annualized operating expenses based on results of operations in the second quarter of  which is widely regarded as the final quarter before the industry and economic downturn  would be billion 
factoring in pro forma adjustments as noted in the table below to remove amortization of goodwill and to add estimated operating expenses for a full quarter of expenses for the veba group which was acquired during the second quarter of  operating expenses annualized would have been approximately billion based on results for the second quarter of this represents an annualized expense reduction of million since the second quarter of furthermore  the previously discussed weakening of the us dollar in comparison to most foreign currencies  particularly the euro which strengthened against the us dollar by over in the fourth quarter of as compared to the second quarter of  has offset a portion of the impact of the significant actions the company has taken to reduce costs and improve profitability 
assuming a constant exchange rate with that of december for all foreign functional currency subsidiaries of avnet would yield total cost reductions of the same ten quarter period of approximately million on an annualized basis

on a segment basis  em improved its operating profit margin dramatically year over year in as compared to in 
however  operating profit margins in both computer businesses were down due to lower revenues across business lines  lower gross profit margins and business mix issues discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses in were billion as compared to billion in as a percentage of sales  these operating expenses increased substantially to during as compared to in due to the dramatic decline in revenues discussed in sales 
these operating expenses included restructuring and other charges as discussed above totaling million of sales in and million of sales in however  the revenue declines during these comparative periods occurred at an unprecedented rate and faster than management could reasonably remove expense from the business resulting in an increase in expenses as a percentage of sales 
the company reported an operating loss of million in as compared to operating income in of million 
each year s results were negatively impacted by total restructuring and other charges of million of sales and million of sales in and  respectively 
each of the company s operating groups experienced deep year over year declines in operating income when comparing to em s operating income was million  down from levels of million 
cm and ac also experienced declines in operating income  from million and million in  respectively  to levels of million and million  respectively 

table of contents interest expense and other income expense interest expense was million in as compared with million in  representing a decline year over year 
this decrease is due primarily to the ongoing debt reductions and reduced drawings under the accounts receivable securitization program hereafter referred to as the program see liquidity and capital resources financing transactions during consolidated debt balances at june  were billion as compared to billion at june  billion including drawings under the program  representing a decrease of million  or million including the reduced drawings under the program 
the reductions in debt are a result of the positive operating cash flows and reductions in working capital over the course of through similar efforts in as well  the company has reduced its total outstanding debt by billion  or approximately  since december other income  net  was million in as compared to million in the increase in other income  net  was primarily a result of favorable foreign currency translation impacts during also during  the company incurred million of debt extinguishment costs associated with the redemption of a portion of its notes due august  and its notes due october  as is further discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
interest expense was million in as compared with million in  declining by 
the decrease was due primarily to the reduction of debt and reduced drawings under the program as a result of cash generated by reductions in working capital and  to a lesser extent  as a result of lower interest rates on the company s variable rate debt 
the company reduced its total debt and its drawings under the program by approximately million from june to june and billion from the end of december to june income tax provision benefit the company s effective tax rate on its loss from continuing operations was a benefit of in as compared to a benefit of in the mix of profits globally at varying statutory rates impacts the company s consolidated tax rate 
the company also benefited in from the favorable impact of certain tax planning initiatives put in place over the course of the prior year 
avnet s effective tax rate on its loss from continuing operations was a benefit of in as compared to a provision rate of in the high rate in is primarily a result of certain non deductible costs incurred associated with the kent acquisition as well as the non deductibility of goodwill amortization  which was ceased in accordance with sfas at the beginning of see change in accounting principle goodwill 
net income loss from continuing operations as a result of the factors described in the preceding sections of this md a  the consolidated loss from continuing operations was million per share on a diluted basis in as compared to million per share on a diluted basis in these results include the negative after tax impact of restructuring and other charges including the debt extinguishment costs in of million per share on a diluted basis and million per share on a diluted basis in and  respectively 
the company recorded a net loss from continuing operations of million in  or per share on a diluted basis  as compared to net income from continuing operations of million  or breakeven on a per share basis  in these results included the after tax impact of restructuring and other charges totaling million per share on a diluted basis in and million per share on a diluted basis in the decline in profitability is a result of the confluence of the various factors discussed above in this md a 

table of contents change in accounting principle goodwill in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced with periodic tests for goodwill impairment and that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their useful lives 
the company elected early adoption of the provisions of sfas effective june   the first day of the company s fiscal year therefore  the amortization of goodwill was suspended effective on that date 
under the required transitional provisions of sfas  the company identified and evaluated its reporting units for impairment as of june  using a two step process 
the company engaged an outside valuation consultant to assist in this process 
the first step was to ascertain whether there was an indication that any of the company s goodwill was impaired 
this was accomplished by identifying the company s reporting units pursuant to the guidelines set out in sfas and then determining the carrying value of each of those reporting units by assigning the company s assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill  to each of those reporting units as of june  for the purpose of this process  the reporting unit structure was defined as each of the three regional businesses americas  emea and asia within each of the company s three operating groups 
the fair value of each reporting unit was determined by using a combination of present value and multiple of earnings valuation techniques 
such fair value was then compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit 
as a result of completing the first step of the process  it was determined that there was an impairment of goodwill related to the company s em and cm operations in both emea and asia 
the company identified no impairment of goodwill in the americas region 
in the second step of the process  the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill was compared to its carrying value 
this was done in order to determine the amount of impairment  that is  the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the fair value 
as a result of the valuation process  the company recorded an impairment charge of million  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for  the charge resulting from the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle did not impact cash flow 
the magnitude of the transition impairment charge was significantly impacted by the timing of the effective date of when the fair value analysis was performed and the designation of the reporting unit structure 
since the company adopted sfas on june   the fair value analysis was required to be completed as of that date 
due to the difficult business and economic conditions at that date  which severely impacted the market sectors in which the company operates  and the uncertainty as to when such conditions would materially improve  the fair value of the company s businesses was significantly less than it might have been at other times 
in other words  in a cyclical business  the timing of a valuation such as this may be an important factor in the outcome of the valuation exercise 
the reporting units with the most significant impairment of goodwill are in europe where the company has not yet generated an acceptable level of profits and cash flows 
in addition  the defined reporting unit structure has resulted in an impairment of goodwill which includes goodwill related to certain recent acquisitions that otherwise might not have been impaired 
the company conducts its periodic test for goodwill impairment annually  on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter 
the company s annual impairment tests in and have yielded no additional impairments to the carrying value of the company s goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows in  cash flow of million was generated from continuing operations before depreciation  amortization  deferred taxes and other non cash items and million was generated by reductions in working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents  thus generating net cash flow from operations of million

during  the company amended its syndicated bank credit facilities 
prior to the amendments  the bank credit facilities included a multi year credit facility with a syndicate of banks that provided up to million in financing and a day credit facility providing up to in financing the original syndicated bank credit facility also included a million term loan facility that matured in november 
the multi year credit facility was a three year revolving  multi currency facility that was to mature on october  the company was able to select from various interest rate options and maturities under this facility 
the amended terms of the multi year credit facility reduced the available borrowings under the facility to million 
additionally  the day credit facility was terminated as part of the amendments 
these amendments also modified certain covenants to the agreement 
the company was in compliance with all of the covenants at june  the amended agreement also contained a springing lien provision whereby borrowings under the amended multi year credit facility would become secured by various assets of the company if a avnet received a debt rating of ba or lower by moody s or bb or lower by s p or b if avnet terminated its current accounts receivable securitization program see below without simultaneously entering into another securitization with similar terms 
on september   moody s adjusted the company s debt rating to ba management believed it was in the company s best interests to terminate the facility rather than allow the liens to spring when no amounts were outstanding or expected to be drawn prior to the facility s october expiration 
see liquidity for further discussion of the company s borrowing capacity and expected financing needs 
in addition to its primary financing arrangements  the company has several small lines of credit in various locations to fund the short term working capital  foreign exchange  overdraft and letter of credit needs of its wholly owned subsidiaries in europe and asia 
avnet generally guarantees its subsidiaries debt under these facilities 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has a million accounts receivable securitization program the program with two financial institutions whereby it may sell  on a revolving basis  an undivided interest in a pool of its trade accounts receivable 
under the program  the company may sell receivables in securitization transactions and retain a subordinated interest and servicing rights to those receivables 
receivables sold under the program are sold without legal recourse to third party conduits through a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that is consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
the program qualifies for sale treatment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfer and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the availability for financing under the program is dependent on the level of the company s trade receivables from month to month 
there were no receivables sold under the program at june  at june   the company had sold million of receivables under the program  which is reflected as a reduction of receivables in the consolidated balance sheets 
the cash received from the sale of receivables was used primarily to pay down outstanding debt 
the purpose of the program is to provide the company with an additional source of liquidity at interest rates more favorable than it could receive through other forms of financing 
the program was amended during to adjust certain minimum senior unsecured credit ratings that the company must maintain in order to continue using the program in its current form 
these minimum credit ratings were again amended subsequent to under the program  as amended in  the minimum credit rating triggers are ba by moody s investor services moody s and bb by standard poors s p 
this most recent amendment effectively extended the term of the program to august 
table of contents covenants and conditions the program contains certain covenants relating to the quality of the receivables sold under the program in addition to the minimum unsecured ratings triggers discussed in off balance sheet arrangements above 
if these conditions are not met  the company may not be able to borrow any additional funds under the program and the financial institutions generally have the right to accelerate any amounts outstanding 
circumstances that could affect the company s ability to meet the required covenants and conditions of the program include the duration and depth of the current economic downturn and the impact on profitability  perceived financial strength or weakness by credit rating agencies and various other economic  market and industry factors 
the company was in compliance with all covenants  including the minimum unsecured credit ratings triggers  for the program at june  in the case of any default  the company would either have to negotiate with the lenders to modify the program or pay off all amounts outstanding  terminate the program and  if necessary  seek alternative financing 
as of june   there were no drawings under the program 
see liquidity for further discussion of the company s availability under these various facilities 
liquidity under its current financing arrangements discussed in financing transactions above  the company had an aggregate of approximately million in additional borrowing capacity at june  million after the termination of the multi year facility subsequent to  as discussed in financing transactions 
the company also had an additional million of cash and cash equivalents at june   although million of that cash on hand was held in an escrow account that is restricted to repay the remaining principal and interest obligations on the and notes 
management believes its borrowing capacity  before and after the termination of the multi year facility  its current cash availability and its ability to generate cash from normal operations are sufficient to meet its projected working capital requirements and debt obligations maturing in the upcoming year 
the following table highlights the company s liquidity and related ratios for the past two years comparative analysis liquidity years ended percentage change june  june  to dollars in millions current assets quick assets current liabilities working capital total debt total capital quick ratio working capital ratio debt to total capital ratios that include cash and cash equivalents include million of restricted cash held in escrow at june  to fund remaining principal and interest payments on the and notes see financing transactions for further discussion 
the company had million of accounts receivable sold under the accounts receivable securitization program at june  there were no drawings under this program at june  
the receivables sold are excluded from accounts receivable and drawings under this program are excluded from debt for the purpose of the balances and ratios in the table above 

table of contents the company s quick assets at june  totaled billion as compared with billion at june  at june   quick assets were greater than the company s current liabilities by million as compared to million at june  this increase in quick assets is due in part to the increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the company s positive cash flows and financing transactions completed during see cash flow and financing transactions above as well as the increase in receivables in the june  consolidated balance sheet which resulted in part from the reduced drawings under the company s accounts receivable securitization program during working capital at june  was billion as compared with billion at june  this decrease is primarily a result of the previously discussed inventory reductions since  offset in part by the increase in quick assets 
at june   to support each dollar of current liabilities  the company had of quick assets and of other current assets for a total of as compared with at june  the company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
long term contractual obligations the company has the following contractual obligations outstanding as of june  in millions due in less due in due in due after total than year years years years long term debt  including amounts due within one year operating leases at june   the company has two interest rate swaps outstanding on one of its fixed rate debt instruments which have yielded  in accordance with sfas  as amended  a fair value adjustment of million to the company s long term debt included in the consolidated balance sheet at june  in connection with the company s january acquisition of of the stock of eurotronics bv  which went to market as sei  the company entered into a share purchase agreement with the sellers that called for an additional payment of cash or common stock of the company if the company s share price does not reach per share by january this guarantee would result in an additional payment to the sellers of approximately million based on the company s stock price as of june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
the company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
the company has used interest rate swaps that convert certain fixed rate debt to variable rate debt  effectively hedging the change in fair value of the fixed rate debt resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
at june   the company has two interest rate swaps outstanding under which the company pays a variable interest rate and receives a fixed interest rate 
subsequent to  the company entered into three additional interest rate swaps on million of the company s notes  in order to hedge the change in fair value of this fixed rate debt resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
the following table sets forth the 
table of contents scheduled maturities and the total fair value generally based on quoted market prices of the company s debt outstanding at june  dollars in millions there total at fair value at after june  june  liabilities fixed rate debt average interest rate floating rate debt average interest rate interest rate swaps fixed to variable average pay rate libor average receive rate many of the company s subsidiaries  on occasion  purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies 
this subjects the company to the risks associated with the fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates 
the company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging offsetting receivables and payables as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of less than sixty days 
the company adjusts all foreign denominated balances and any outstanding foreign exchange contracts to fair market value through the consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  the market risk related to foreign exchange contracts is offset by changes in valuation of the underlying items being hedged 
the asset or liability representing the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is classified in the captions other current assets or accrued expenses and other  as applicable  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
a hypothetical change in currency exchange rates under the contracts outstanding at june  would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million to the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts  which would generally be offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged positions
