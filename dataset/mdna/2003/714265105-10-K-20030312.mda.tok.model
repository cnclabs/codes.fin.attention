as a result  we help our customers achieve their business objectives  whether those objectives are to accelerate growth  streamline operations  or enhance customer service capabilities 
we offer our services under three primary lines of business it solutions  government services and consulting  which we discussed above in item  business 
it solutions  our largest line of business  provides services to our customers primarily under long term contracts in strategic relationships 
these services include technology and business process services  as well as industry domain based  short term project and consulting services 
within it solutions  we face the market through our four vertical industry groups healthcare  financial services  industrial services and strategic markets

this line of business provides to our customers high value and repeatable services related to business and technical expertise and the design and implementation of business and software solutions  primarily under short term contracts related to specific projects 
we consider these three primary lines of business to be reportable segments  and therefore we include financial information and disclosures about these reportable segments in our consolidated financial statements 
this financial information can be found in note  segment and certain geographic data  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included herein 
results of operations comparison of to revenue total revenue increased in by to  million from  million in this increase in revenue was due to increases in revenue for the it solutions and government services segments  partially offset by a decrease in revenue for the consulting segment 
revenue for the it solutions segment increased to  million in from  million in this increase was primarily attributable to million in revenue from acquisitions consummated in and in the healthcare market  million in revenue from contracts signed during with new and existing customers in which the scope of services to be provided was expanded  million of revenue in relating to fees paid in connection with the termination of services provided through two joint ventures  and million from other existing accounts  primarily in the healthcare industry 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by million decrease as a result of exiting certain business relationships and under performing delivery units and closing geographic project sales efforts in  and million decrease in revenue from ubs 
revenue from ubs decreased to million in from million in due primarily to lower spending by ubs on infrastructure and discretionary project services as a result of cost savings initiatives implemented by us and ubs 
we also expect a year over year decline in revenue from ubs in in july  we acquired adi technology corporation and formed our government services segment 
revenue from this segment was million for in february  we acquired soza company  ltd 
as a result of these acquisitions  we expect revenue from our government services segment to increase significantly 
in  soza had revenue of approximately million 
revenue from the consulting segment decreased to million in from million in due to continued weak demand for custom application development services  partially offset by growth in systems integration and package implementation services 
domestic revenue grew by in to  million from million in  and increased as a percent of total revenue to from in the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of new contract signings and acquisitions in and non domestic revenue  consisting of european and asian operations  decreased by in to million from million in and decreased as a percent of total revenue to from over the same period 
the largest components of european operations were the united kingdom and switzerland 
in the united kingdom  revenue for decreased to million from million for in switzerland  revenue for decreased to million from million for asian operations generated revenue of million in compared to million in  respectively 
these revenue decreases from are due to a revenue decline from ubs  as well a decrease in the number of customers in these foreign countries 
gross margin direct costs of services increased in by to  million from million in gross margin increased to of total revenue in as compared to of total revenue in in our analysis of our gross margin percentages for and  we identified the following items that are important in understanding this change in  we recorded million of charges  including million relating to the bankruptcy of a customer  anc rental corporation  and million from reducing the basis of software and other assets used in service offerings that we exited 
in  we received a million payment from anc that was previously believed to be unrecoverable  and we recorded million of gross profit on million of revenue associated with fees paid in connection with the termination of services provided through two joint ventures that we exited during without the effects of these items  the gross margin for would have declined to of total revenue from of total revenue in this decrease in gross margin was due primarily to generally lower gross margins on contracts signed since the middle of and on acquisitions consummated in partially offsetting this decline in gross margin was lower expense for associate incentive programs in consistent with market conditions 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased in by to million from million in and decreased as a percent of total revenue to from 
in our analysis of sg a for both and  we identified the following items that are important in understanding this change as discussed in more detail below  in we recorded million in expense relating primarily to severance and facility related costs as a result of realigning our operating structure  in  we recorded an additional million relating to severance and other costs to exit certain activities as we continued our efforts to streamline our operations  and during  we recorded million of expense relating to an investigation of our involvement in the california energy market 
without the effects of these items  sg a would have decreased in by to million from million in and decreased as a percent of total revenue to from 
this decrease is primarily due to the elimination of the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangibles  which was million in  a temporary decline in selling expense  and our focused efforts to reduce sg a costs as a percentage of revenue 
other statement of operations items interest income  net  decreased by to million in from million in due to a decrease in the average cash balance in as compared to and an overall decrease in interest rates 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was million in compared to million in this decrease from is primarily due to a reduction in our equity in earnings from hcl perot systems nv  a software joint venture based in india 
equity in earnings from hcl perot systems decreased to million in  which was an estimate based on the unaudited results of hcl perot systems  from million in this decrease was due primarily to a charge to write down the goodwill related to an acquisition  which reduced our equity in earnings by approximately million  and million of expense related to a contingent liability 
in addition  hcl perot systems has experienced an overall reduction in their revenue related to the weak demand for custom application development services 
in  we recorded million of losses associated with billingzone  a start up joint venture that we sold in other income expense  net  was a million net expense in as compared to a million net expense in during  we recorded a million loss when we divested our share of billingzone  and during we recorded a million expense for the impairment of an investment in marketable equity securities 
income tax expense for included a million benefit from the reduction of a valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets as well as million of other tax benefits 
without the effect of these tax items  our effective tax rate for would have been 
during we recorded an million valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets due to the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets 
without the effect of this million charge  our effective tax rate for would have been 
comparison of to revenue total revenue increased in by to  million from  million in this increase was due to an increase in revenue from the it solutions segment offset by decreases in revenue from the consulting segment and from all other operating areas 
revenue for the it solutions segment increased  or million  in to  million from  million in this increase was primarily due to the following items million in revenue from three acquisitions health systems design corporation  which we acquired in december  and the acquisitions of covation  llc and advanced receivables strategy  inc  which we acquired during million in revenue from contracts that we signed during million increase in revenue from ubs 
revenue from ubs increased to million in from million in due to increased spending by ubs on infrastructure services 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by a million decrease in revenue from project related services that we performed in this segment  which was primarily due to our discontinuation of geographic project sales efforts and a weakening market for such services 
revenue from the consulting segment decreased  or million  to million in from million in due to a weakening market for such services 
domestic revenue grew by in to million from million in  and increased as a percent of total revenue to from in the prior year 
this increase was a result of new contract signings and acquisitions in and  which were primarily domestic 
non domestic revenue  consisting of european and asian operations  increased by in to million from million in  but decreased as a percent of total revenue to from over the same periods 
the largest components of european operations were the united kingdom and switzerland 
in the united kingdom revenue for decreased slightly to million from million in revenue for in switzerland  revenue for increased slightly to million from million in revenue for asian operations generated revenue of million  or of total revenue  in and million  or of total revenue  in  respectively 
on march   we completed the acquisition of solutions consulting  inc all pre acquisition revenue and operating expenses of solutions consulting have been included in the consolidated statements of operations for  and pre acquisition operating earnings have been eliminated in other income expense  net  as permitted by accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of  we incurred a million compensation charge that was a direct result of the acquisition of solutions consulting 
gross margin direct costs of services increased in by to million from million in gross margin decreased to of total revenue in as compared to of total revenue in in our analysis of gross margin percentages for and  we identified the following items that are important in understanding this change in  we recorded million of expense relating to the bankruptcy of a customer  anc rental corporation  which included the following million for the write down of an intangible asset associated with our anc contract  million for amounts owed to us for services performed  and million for certain contract related costs 
also in we recorded million of expense as we reduced the basis of software and other assets used in service offerings that we exited during without the effects of these items  gross margin for would have been of total revenue  which is a slight increase from the gross margin for of of total revenue 
this increase is primarily due to the exiting of a separately identifiable unprofitable operation in the first quarter of the cost savings that we achieved as a result of exiting this operation were partially offset by a change in revenue mix from higher profit margin services  including project and discretionary services  to infrastructure services  and  a decline in profitability on several telecommunications contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased in by to million from million in and increased as a percent of total revenue to from 
in our analysis of sg a for both and  we identified the following items that are important in understanding this change as described in more detail below  during we recorded million of charges as a result of our realigned operating structure 
during  we recorded million of expense  which was composed of million of asset impairments and million related to the closure of certain facilities 
without the effect of these items  sg a would have decreased to of total revenue for as compared to of total revenue for this decrease was primarily due to cost reductions made in connection with realigning our operating structure in other statement of operations items interest income  net  decreased by to million in from million in due to a decrease in the average cash balance in as compared to and an overall decrease in interest rates 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was million in compared to equity in losses of million in during  equity in earnings from hcl perot systems increased to million from million in in  these earnings were offset by losses of million from start up joint ventures  which included a million charge to adjust the carrying amount of our investment in one of these joint ventures 
losses from these start up joint ventures totaled only million during other income expense  net  decreased in to a million net expense from a million of income in  primarily due to the following significant items that we recorded in million net gain from the sale of a equity interest in systor ag  a subsidiary of ubs  million gain from the partial sale of an investment in marketable equity securities  million expense associated with the elimination of the pre acquisition earnings of solutions consulting for the first quarter of  and  million expense from the impairment of an investment in marketable equity securities during during  we recorded an million valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets due to the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets 
without the effect of this million charge  our effective tax rate for would have been  which is consistent with the effective tax rate for realigned operating structure during  we realigned our operating structure  resulting in charges totaling million  of which million was recorded during the first quarter of and million was recorded during the third quarter of we recorded these charges in the consolidated statements of operations as million in direct cost of services and million in sg a  and these charges consist of the following million expense related to the elimination of approximately administrative and non billable positions in all business functions and in all geographic areas of the company  million expense for the consolidation and closure of facilities  including those facilities impacted by our realigned operating structure and the consolidation of our dallas area operations into one facility located in plano  texas  and million expense related to adjustments to reduce the basis of certain facility related assets and the basis of software and other assets used in exited service offerings to their net realizable value 
as mentioned above  during we recorded an additional million relating to severance and other costs to exit certain activities as we continued our efforts to streamline our operations 
as a result of these realignment activities  we realized savings that helped to offset profit pressures 
at december   the balance remaining to be settled associated with these activities is million  which we expect will be substantially settled in cash by september  liquidity and capital resources in  cash and cash equivalents decreased to million from million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in in our analysis of net cash provided by operating activities for and  we identified the following significant items that are important in understanding this change long term accrued revenue increased by million in as compared to an increase of million in these revenues cannot currently be billed and collected but will be billed in the future as specified in the terms of the related long term services contracts 
during  we paid million more than we paid in related to year end bonuses to associates 
during  we paid million less than we paid in associated with our realigned operating structure activities 
during  we made net tax payments of approximately million as compared to receiving net tax refunds of approximately million during net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in this increase was due primarily to a million increase in the amount of net cash paid for acquisitions of businesses 
during we paid million in cash for the acquisitions of csrg and adi and for an additional earnout payment associated with the acquisition of ars 
during  we paid million in cash for acquisitions  primarily for the acquisition of ars 
in february  we acquired soza company  ltd  a professional services company that provides information technology  management consulting  financial services and environmental services primarily to public sector customers  for million in cash including million which is being held in an escrow account for up to two years 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in as compared to million in this increase is due primarily to million of proceeds received from ubs relating to the exercise of options to purchase approximately million shares of our class b common stock 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in the amount of shares of our class a common stock that we repurchased in as compared to we routinely maintain cash balances in certain european and asian currencies to fund operations in those regions 
during  foreign exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted our non domestic cash balances by million  as british pounds  swiss francs  and euros all strengthened against the us dollar 
our foreign exchange policy does not call for hedging foreign exchange exposures that are not likely to impact net income or working capital 
we have no committed line of credit or other borrowings  and we anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalents and expected net cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient funds to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future 
as discussed below  in february we acquired soza company  ltd 
for million in cash 
if we make additional acquisitions using cash  we may be required to obtain a line of credit to finance any such acquisition 
contractual obligations and contingent commitments the following table sets forth our significant contractual obligations for the periods indicated in millions thereafter total operating leases purchase commitments restructuring payments total we discuss these contractual obligations in note  commitments and contingencies  and note  realigned operating structure  of notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included herein 
we also discuss purchase commitments below 
the following table sets forth our significant contingent commitments for the periods indicated in millions and represent the maximum principal amount of such commitments thereafter total contingent payments for acquisitions contingent payment on operating lease total we discuss the contingent payment on an operating lease below and in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the contingent payments for acquisitions are discussed below and in note  acquisitions  and note  subsequent event  of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
operating lease in june  we entered into an operating lease agreement with a special purpose entity for the use of land  existing office buildings  improvements  as well as the development of data center facilities in plano  texas 
this special purpose entity is a trust that is owned by a consortium of financial institutions  and we have no equity ownership and no managerial involvement in this entity 
the initial term of this lease extends through june  with one optional two year renewal period 
at the end of the lease  we are required to either renew the lease  purchase the property for the remaining lease obligation  or arrange for the sale of the property to a third party  with us guaranteeing to the lessor proceeds on such sale of of the original fair value of the land  plus of the original fair value of the buildings and any additional improvements 
the fair value of the facilities is approximately million 
rent expense under this operating lease is equal to the interest expense owed by the special purpose entity to the banks  and is a variable amount equal to libor plus basis points at december  on approximately million  which is the remaining lease obligation 
we believe that this lease rate is currently less than prevailing market lease rates for similar facilities 
we currently do not consolidate this entity 
however  based on the current structure of the lease and the recently issued accounting pronouncement  financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 which is discussed in more detail below  we will be required to consolidate this entity effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after june  upon consolidation of this entity  we would increase our assets and long term debt by approximately million  and we would begin recording an additional depreciation charge of approximately million per year 
the assets would be recorded as land  buildings  and improvements 
this lease contains certain standard financial covenants which  if not met  may require us to repay the approximately million to the special purpose entity 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants  and we currently expect to remain in compliance for the remainder of the lease term 
purchase commitments we have agreements with three telecommunication service providers to purchase services from  or sell services on behalf of  these providers at varying annual levels 
we are currently satisfying the minimum purchase requirements for two of the vendors 
with regard to the third vendor  under the terms and conditions of the agreement  we agreed to purchase or sell services having a gross value of million over a four year commitment period 
the second commitment period ends in march we are currently in discussions with this vendor to restructure the terms of the agreement  and we are unable to estimate the amount of possible loss  if any  that may result from the completion of these discussions 
in june  we entered into an agreement with a certain airline to purchase a minimum of million of air travel mileage on an annual basis for five years 
we have made three of the five annual payments  with the remaining two payments to be made in june of and other commitments and contingencies as discussed in note  acquisitions  we may be required to make additional payments related to two acquisitions  dependent upon these two companies achieving certain financial targets over designated time periods 
we may be required to make three additional payments to the sellers of ars totaling million over the next two years  million of which may be paid in the first six months of up to of each additional payment to the sellers of ars may be in stock  at our discretion 
in addition  we may be required to pay to the sellers of adi an additional million over the next two years  million of which may be paid in the first six months of at our discretion  we may pay up to of these additional amounts in stock 
in addition  as discussed below in subsequent event  we recently acquired soza company  ltd 
in addition to the initial purchase price of million  we may be required to make additional payments totaling up to million  of which up to may be in stock  at our discretion 
we are currently working on a significant software development project for which the actual cost of development will significantly exceed the fee as specified in the contract 
while our contract enables us to collect for some of the overages above the specified fee  we believe that we will not fully recover all of the overages 
therefore  we expect to suffer a loss on this development project 
we expect our it outsourcing contract with this customer to be profitable over the full term of the agreement even after considering the expected loss on the software development project 
the estimated billings and costs related to this project are included in our estimates of revenue and costs for the entire it outsourcing contract that we used to recognize revenue for under the percentage of completion method 
the amount of long term accrued revenue at december   related to this entire contract was million 
as discussed below in our discussion regarding the adoption of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  in the first quarter of we expect to record a loss on this separate development project in the amount of to per share 
however  our actual losses with respect to this development effort may eventually exceed our current estimates 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is important to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we provide services under level of effort  unit price  fixed price  and risk reward contracts  with the length of contracts ranging up to twelve years 
four basic criteria must be met before we can recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we determine whether criteria and are met based on our judgments regarding the nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
revenue from level of effort contracts is based on time and materials  direct costs plus a fee which may be either a fixed amount or a percentage of direct costs incurred  or a combination of these methods and may be based on a set fee for a specified level of resources that is adjusted for incremental resource usage 
revenue from unit price contracts is recognized based on units utilized or by number of transactions processed during a given period 
for unit price contracts  we establish a per unit fee based on the cost structure associated with the delivery of that unit of service 
for risk reward contracts  we recognize revenue primarily at the time we are reasonably assured as to how much will ultimately be collected 
for fixed price contracts  we use the percentage of completion method to recognize revenue and profit as work progresses 
this approach relies on estimates of total expected direct costs at completion  which are compared to actual direct costs incurred to date to arrive at an estimate of revenue and profit earned to date 
recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not complete our projects within the planned periods of time  or do not satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then profit may be significantly and negatively affected or losses may need to be recognized 
revisions to profit estimates are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  or long term accrued revenue  on uncompleted fixed price contracts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
as discussed below under accounting standards issued  as a result of the issuance of financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we plan to change our method of accounting for revenue from fixed price contracts in valuation of goodwill and intangibles our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we could incur 
the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangibles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future business trends and growth 
for each of the significant acquisitions completed during  and  we obtained a third party valuation of the intangible assets 
if an event occurs which would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill or other intangibles  such revision could result in an impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
year end bonus plan one of our various compensation methods is to pay to certain associates a year end bonus  which is based on associate and team performance as well as on our overall financial results 
the amount of bonus expense that we record each quarter is based on several factors  including our financial performance for that quarter  our latest expectations for full year results  and management s discretion 
as a result  the amount of bonus expense that we may record in each quarter can vary significantly 
contingencies we account for claims and contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment 
we consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards board no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   we had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million 
based upon our estimates of future taxable income and review of available tax planning strategies  we believe that it is more likely than not that only million of such assets will be realized  resulting in a valuation allowance of million relating to certain foreign jurisdictions 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the need for and adequacy of this valuation allowance based on the expected realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our latest forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
accounting standards issued financial accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
fas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement supersedes financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
we are required to adopt fas no later than january  we do not believe that the adoption of fas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
financial accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued fas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends fas  accounting for stock based compensation and establishes two alternative methods of transition from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  fas requires prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income and requires disclosure for these effects in interim financial information 
the provisions for the alternative transition methods are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and the amended disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  and allow for early application 
we currently plan to continue accounting for stock based compensation under apb financial accounting standards emerging issues task force issue we have long term fixed price contracts that include certain deliverables and ongoing service elements 
we recognize revenue on these contracts under the percentage of completion method using incurred costs as a measure of progress towards completion 
on november   the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  regarding when and how to separate elements of a contract into separate units of accounting 
we are required to adopt eitf for all new revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  alternatively  we may also apply the provisions of eitf to existing contracts and record the effect of adoption as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we plan to adopt eitf as of january   for both existing and prospective customer contracts 
this voluntary adoption for existing contracts  which we believe will provide greater transparency into the performance of our multi element arrangements  will result in a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of between 
and 
per share  which includes a charge of between 
and 
per share to recognize a loss on a contract element included in an otherwise profitable contract 
financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual reports ending after december  we adopted the disclosure provisions of fin during the fourth quarter of fiscal and such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the recognition provisions of fin but expect that the adoption of these provisions will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position upon adoption 
financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin which changes the criteria by which one company includes another entity in its consolidated financial statements 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and apply in the first fiscal period beginning after june   for variable interest entities created prior to february  we have an operating lease contract with a variable interest entity also called a special purpose entity for the use of land  existing office buildings  improvements  as well as the development of data center facilities in plano  texas 
we believe the estimated fair market value of the underlying assets is no less than the remaining lease obligations totaling approximately million at december  we currently do not consolidate this entity 
however  based on the current structure of the lease and the provisions of fin  we will be required to consolidate this entity effective for the first fiscal period beginning after june   as discussed above in operating lease 
subsequent event on february   we acquired soza company  ltd  a professional services company that provides information technology  management consulting  financial services and environmental services primarily to public sector customers 
as a result of the acquisition  we increased our customer base and service offerings in the government services segment 
the purchase price includes million in cash including million which is being held in an escrow account for up to two years and may include additional payments totaling up to million in cash or stock over the next two years 
the possible payments are contingent on soza achieving certain financial targets over the same period  and at our discretion  up to of these payments may be settled in our class a common stock 
the results of operations of soza and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date 
upon completion of the tangible and intangible asset appraisals  the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired will be recorded as goodwill on the consolidated balance sheets and will be assigned to the government services segment 
the amount of goodwill from this acquisition will not be deductible for tax purposes 
related party transactions we are currently providing  under a three year contract which will end in  information technology services for hillwood enterprise lp  which is controlled and partially owned by ross perot  jr 
this contract includes provisions under which we may be penalized if our actual performance does not meet the levels of service specified in the contract  and such provisions are consistent with those included in other customer contracts 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded revenue of million  million and 
million and direct cost of services of million  million and million  respectively 
prior to us entering into this arrangement  our audit committee reviewed and approved this contract 
during  we entered into a sublease agreement with perot services company  llc  which is controlled and owned by ross perot  for approximately  square feet of office space at our plano  texas facility 
rent over the term of the lease is approximately million per year 
the initial lease term is months with one optional month renewal period 
the lease also provides for us to pay a million allowance for modifications to the leased space 
perot services company  llc will pay all modification costs in excess of the allowance 
prior to us entering into this arrangement  our audit committee reviewed and approved this contract 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
we generally manage these transactions by ensuring that costs to service these contracts are incurred in the same currency in which revenue is received 
by matching revenues and costs to the same currency  we have been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
we use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions when necessary 
we do not foresee changing our foreign currency exposure management strategy 
during  of our revenue was generated outside of the united states 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would change revenue by  or million 
in our opinion  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency as well as the impact of local income taxes 
at december   the company had approximately million of non us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents
