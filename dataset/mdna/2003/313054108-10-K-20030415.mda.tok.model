the company makes no commitment to update any forward looking statement or to disclose any facts  events  or circumstances after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statement  other than as required by law 
the company was encouraged by its improved profitability in  despite reduced revenue 
while consolidated sales levels for the year ended december  declined compared to the same period last year  in large part due to the closure of the vogue facility in the second quarter of  they were consistent with the company s sales plan for although there was a definite reduction in new order volume in relation to the sales plan in the third and fourth quarters the company is cautious concerning sales in the softening of sales in relation to plan in the third and fourth quarters of has continued into the early months of  particularly in the trailer segment  as the stationary economy and consumer uncertainty continues 
at december   the new order backlog for trailers was million compared with million at december  at march   the trailer order backlog was million compared to million at march  the motorcoach backlog was million at december  compared with million at december  at march  the motorcoach backlog was 
table of contents million compared to million at march  while the company does not know how long the current order trend will last  it will continue its aggressive measures to promote sales and manage costs 
management expects that sales will improve when national economic business conditions improve 
there is continuing focus by the company on the sales and marketing related activities that have been effective in increasing sales in the past but there is no assurance they will be successful in increasing order levels to maintain or exceed sales volume 
the company believes its name recognition and close affiliation with the motorsports industry will continue to have a positive impact on its sales of specialty trailers  transporters and luxury motorcoaches 
with more than percent of its revenue from end users in motorsports and leisure and entertainment categories  which also includes horse trailers  and with its strong position in the livestock trailer market  the company believes it is strategically well positioned to continue to benefit from these markets 
the company introduced almost new and enhanced models of trailers in and added motorcoach models with multiple slide out features 
in  the company entered into two agreements that could be beneficial in enhancing its operating results in and following  as follows the company entered into a master sales agreement with universal luxury coaches  llc ulc under which ulc will purchase from featherlite up to featherlite vantare and featherlite vogue motorcoaches over a one year period 
ulc is a related party controlled by the conrad clement  tracy clement  eric clement and james wooley  officers and shareholders of featherlite 
ulc received approval by florida s department of business professional regulators to sell timeshares of luxury coaches and will purchase motorcoaches exclusively from featherlite as the timeshare units are sold 
featherlite will also have agreements with ulc to lease ulc office space and to provide service on the ulc motorcoaches 
the company entered into an operating agreement with benbow chemical packaging  inc benbow to form featherlite chemicals  llc  a new jersey corporation fcc 
featherlite will own a percent interest in fcc with benbow owning the remaining interest 
the purpose of fcc will be to market and sell car care products manufactured by benbow under the featherlite brand name and a nascar license agreement to use the winston cup series name 
the company s future operating results are subject to a number of risks  including the following as described above  during the company signed long term agreements with its lenders with new financial covenants 
the company was not in compliance with certain of these covenants as of december  and at february  and secured waivers for these defaults 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will achieve the requirements of these covenants in the future 
if the company is unable to obtain waivers of future covenant defaults and secure sufficient additional financing to fund its liquidity shortfalls  the company s business will be harmed 
there is a risk related to losing a major supplier of aluminum 
in the past this risk has been relatively nominal as there have been alternate sources of supply 
in recent years  the number of alternate sources of supply has been reduced due to mergers within the aluminum industry 
also  additional time may be required to replace an extruded aluminum supplier due to the fact that dies are required and would have to be made 
the company routinely tries to keep at least three 
table of contents suppliers of each shape so it has a backup supplier if necessary 
however  if the number of suppliers of aluminum is further reduced  or if the company is otherwise unable to obtain its aluminum requirements on a timely basis and on favorable terms  the company s operations would be harmed 
there is a risk related to the loss or interruption in the supply of bus conversion shells from the company s sole supplier of these shells 
the company purchases all of its bus conversion shells from prevost car company located in canada 
although the company has insurance to cover certain losses it may sustain due to fire or other catastrophe at prevost s plant  the company may not be able to obtain conversion shells from another manufacturer on favorable terms or at all 
additionally  if the company is unable to maintain a good working relationship with prevost  it may be required to locate a new supplier of its conversion shells 
in the event of any significant loss or interruptions in the subcontractor s ability to provide such services may harm the company s operations 
the company uses one subcontractor to provide paint and graphic design work to meet customer specifications on certain custom trailers and specialty transporters 
there is a risk to the timely delivery of these trailers in the event of an unforeseen interruption in the subcontractor s ability to provide these services or if the customer delays providing the specifications to the subcontractor 
any long term interruptions in the subcontractor s ability to provide such services  the company s operations may be harmed 
the company begins production of most of the luxury motorcoaches before a customer order is received 
while it is the company s expectation that substantially all of these motorcoaches will be sold to specific customers before production is completed  or shortly thereafter  there is no assurance this will occur 
failure to sell these motorcoaches on a timely basis at prevailing prices could further decrease the liquidity of the company 
the company takes trade ins on both new and used motorcoach sales 
these trade in units are marketed on a retail basis to other customers 
in and  the company experienced a significant decline in the market value of trade in units and certain non current new models and wrote down the carrying value of the used inventory by million and million  respectively  in order to facilitate their sale 
the write down in was  there is a risk that additional write downs of this inventory will occur if these trade in units are not sold at current selling prices  which could adversely impact the company s future operating results 
advances under the company s present financing agreement with ge are based on percent of the cost of eligible new inventory and percent of the defined value of eligible used inventory 
after july   the agreement reduces the advance rate on new coaches more than days old from percent to percent and provides no financing on new or used coaches more than days old or older than model years 
the company has requested and expects that the agreement will be modified to provide for a reduction of percent per month in the advance rate on used coaches more than days old 
this could reduce future aggregate availability under this agreement if the company is unable to sell these coaches before the financing is reduced and require the company to obtain additional financing from another source 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
however  the report of independent public accountants on the december  financial statements states that the company is unable to ascertain whether it will have sufficient liquidity available under its existing lines of credit to fund operations or whether the company will meet various covenant requirements contained in its financing agreements 
while progress has been made to reduce these uncertainties  these matters 
table of contents still raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
in august  the company transferred to the nasdaq smallcap market because its common stock had failed to maintain the minimum market value of public float required for continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
in  nasdaq expressed concern that the company may not be able to sustain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market because of the going concern opinion expressed in the report of independent accountants on the company s december  and consolidated financial statements 
there is no assurance the company will be able to satisfy nasdaq regarding its ability to meet these continued listing requirements  and the company s common stock may be delisted from nasdaq 
in such an event  the market for the company s common stock may become more illiquid  and its shareholders may have a more difficult time selling the company s common stock 
as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements  the company shut down its pryor  oklahoma manufacturing facility in it accrued the estimated rental and other costs of holding this facility through december  in  the company began formulating a plan to use this facility as a sales facility for used coaches owned by others 
an additional accrual was made at the end of for the estimated lease and other costs to be incurred until this facility can be profitable 
in the event the facility cannot generate sufficient income to absorb the annual lease cost by december   the company may be required to continue to accrue additional costs related to this facility 
this could have an adverse impact on the company s future operating results and liquidity 
item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in the cost of aluminum 
aluminum is a commodity that is traded daily on the commodity markets and fluctuates in price 
the average midwest delivered cash price per pound for ingot aluminum during the three years ended december   as reported to the company by its suppliers was in  in  and in the company s cost of aluminum varies from these market prices due to vendor processing charges  timing of purchases  and contractual commitments with suppliers for specific prices and other factors 
the company has obtained commitments from suppliers to provide  at an agreed upon fixed price  about percent of its anticipated requirements for  which reduces a portion of the risk of aluminum cost fluctuations for the year 
if the company is unable to obtain such commitments from suppliers or otherwise reduce the price risk related to the balance of the purchases to meet its requirements in and in the years beyond  this could have an adverse impact on the company s operating results if the cost of aluminum increases significantly above levels in interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in u 
s and international interest rates 
substantially all of the company s debt bears interest at a variable rate 
an interest rate increase by one percentage point would reduce the company s future annual net income by approximately  at current debt levels
