item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties  including those set forth in this report under forward looking statements and under risk factors 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this filing 
business discussion we are a domestic steel manufacturing company that primarily owns and operates electric arc furnace mini mills 
our steel operations include a flat roll division  a structural and rail division and a forthcoming bar division 
our flat roll division is currently our core business and consists of a flat roll mini mill located in butler  indiana  which we built and have operated since  with an annual estimated production capacity of million tons of flat rolled steel  although we achieved record production of million tons during our flat roll division produces a broad range of high quality hot rolled  cold rolled and coated steel products  including a large variety of value added and high margin specialty products  such as thinner gauge rolled products and galvanized products 
we sell our flat rolled products directly to end users  intermediate steel processors and service centers located primarily in the midwestern united states 
our flat rolled products are used in numerous industry sectors  including the automotive  construction and commercial industries 
our largest customer  heidtman steel products  inc purchased million of our flat rolled products  or of our consolidated net sales  during sales from our flat roll division accounted for of our consolidated net sales during and during may  our flat roll division announced plans to construct a new coil coating facility at our butler mini mill at a cost of approximately to million 
we expect to complete construction of this facility and commence coating operations during mid we are constructing this facility to have an annual production capacity of  tons of coated flat rolled products 
as another addition to our flat roll division  on march   we purchased the galvanizing assets of galvpro ii  llc for million  plus a potential of an additional million  based on an earn out formula 
this steel coating facility is located in jeffersonville  indiana  and has an estimated annual production capacity of between  and  tons of light gauge  hot dipped  cold rolled galvanized steel 
we plan to primarily supply the jeffersonville facility with steel coils from our flat roll division 
we anticipate investing an additional to million for certain equipment modifications and upgrades to the facility  with production beginning in mid these additions to our flat roll division should enable us to further increase our mix of higher margin  value added steel product sales 
our structural and rail division consists of a structural and rail mini mill located in columbia city  indiana 
we began construction in may  completed the facility in april and commenced commercial structural steel operations during the third quarter of during  we recorded pre production start up costs of million 
our structural and rail mini mill is designed to have an annual production capacity of up to million tons of structural steel beams  pilings and other steel components  as well as standard and premium grade rails 
we are currently producing at approximately of capacity  although our structural steel sales accounted for only of our consolidated net sales during through regular product introductions and continued production ramp up of structural steel products  the structural and rail division should be able to offer a full complement of wide flange beam and h piling structural steel products by the end of the first quarter of in addition  we expect to begin production of standard rail products during the second quarter of initial rail production will be used in a testing capacity to be monitored by individual railroad companies for qualification purposes 
this qualification process may take between six and nine months for completion 
we generally sell our structural products directly to end users and steel service centers for use in the construction  transportation and industrial machinery markets 
on september   we purchased the special bar quality mini mill assets of qualitech steel sbq  llc  located in pittsboro  indiana  for million 
we plan to invest between and million of additional capital to convert the facility to the production of merchant bars and shapes and reinforcing bar products  as well as sbq products 
we anticipate our bar division will have an annual production capacity of between  and  tons and that initial production will commence during the first quarter of we plan to market the bar products directly to end users  fabricators and steel service centers for the construction  transportation and industrial machinery markets 
the us steel industry has historically been and continues to be  highly cyclical in nature  evidenced by a significant downturn in the second half of through most of during this period  our business was also adversely impacted with our net sales declining from million in to million in and our earnings declining from million in to million in however  during  domestic flat rolled steel prices increased dramatically to more normalized levels from historical cyclical lows in this increase resulted from a number of factors  including a reduction in domestic steel production capacity as a result of past bankruptcies and shutdowns of other us steel producers  a reduction in imports  driven in part by favorable rulings with respect to tariffs and quotas on foreign steel and a strengthening of the overall us economy and the need for end users of steel products to replenish their depleted inventories 
as a result of our efficient  low cost operations  and these improvements in the domestic flat roll steel markets  we achieved record consolidated net sales of million and net income of million during during the first quarter of  however  we have experienced downward pricing pressure due in part to a weakened economy and decreased demand and in part to the reappearances in the market place of substantial domestic steel production tonnage that had left the market during this has resulted in a softening of flat rolled steel prices 
in addition to decreased sales prices  we are also experiencing an increase in our cost of metallic raw materials  causing a further tightening in our first quarter margins 
metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant manufacturing cost  generally accounting for between and of our consolidated cost of goods sold 
the metallic raw material mix utilized in our electric arc furnaces is composed of approximately steel scrap and alternative iron units 
from the second quarter of throughout  we experienced a steady decline in metallic raw material pricing  reaching historically low levels in the fourth quarter of  however  during and into the first quarter of  we have experienced a steady pricing increase 
we believe this increase is partly due to increased demand for these metals from foreign steel manufacturers 
since  in an effort to reduce our exposure to these metals markets  we have tried to develop and commercialize a pioneering process for the production of a virgin form of iron which might serve as a lower cost substitute for the alternative iron units utilized in our electric arc furnaces for melting into new steel 
our process involves the production and conversion of direct reduced iron into liquid pig iron at our iron making facility  iron dynamics 
since we began initial operations at iron dynamics in  the facility has produced and sold a minimal amount of liquid pig iron to our flat roll division 
during and  we encountered a number of difficulties associated with major pieces of equipment and operating processes  causing us to shut down the facility for redesign  re engineering and retrofitting 
in july  we indefinitely suspended operations due to a higher than expected start up and process refinement costs  b lower than expected production quantities  c exceptionally high energy costs  and d historically low steel scrap pricing 
these factors made the cost of producing and using iron dynamics scrap substitute at our flat roll division higher than our cost of purchasing and using steel scrap  more specifically  pig iron 
during the next year  we continued to evaluate our systems and processes  and on july   we announced that iron dynamics would begin experimental production trials in the fourth quarter of after an evaluation of these trials  we concluded that the improved production technology and the ability to recycle waste materials might significantly reduce the per unit cost of liquid pig iron production 
we believe that the restart of the facility is feasible based upon this potential cost reduction  coupled with currently higher steel scrap prices and with the anticipated cost benefits to be realized at our flat roll division from the use of liquid pig iron 
on february   we announced plans to restart iron dynamics and currently expect that operations will restart during the second half of we could begin commercial production later in the year  if the results of our restart indicate that we will be able to produce liquid pig iron in sufficient quantities and at a cost to be competitive with purchased pig iron 
during  we expect to invest million of additional capital for the necessary modifications and refinements to the facility 
during the first quarter of  we also increased our ownership interest in our consolidated subsidiary  new millennium building systems  from to for approximately million 
new millennium began production in and produces joists  girders  trusses and steel roof and floor decking  which is sold primarily in the upper midwest non residential building components market 
consolidated results of operations income statement classifications net sales 
our total net sales are a factor of net tons shipped  product mix and related pricing 
our net sales are determined by subtracting product returns  sales discounts  return allowances and claims from total sales 
we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel  dimensions of product  or certain smaller volumes  based on our cost of production 
we also charge marginally higher prices for our value added products from our cold mill 
these products include hot rolled and cold rolled galvanized products and cold rolled products 
cost of goods sold 
our cost of goods sold represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products 
the principal elements of these costs are steel scrap and scrap substitutes  alloys  natural gas  argon  direct and indirect labor benefits  electricity  oxygen  electrodes  depreciation and freight 
our metallic raw materials  steel scrap and scrap substitutes  represent the most significant component of our cost of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales  finance and accounting  materials and transportation  and administrative departments 
these costs include labor and benefits  professional services  financing cost amortization  property taxes  profit sharing expense and start up costs associated with new projects 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt agreements as described in the notes to our financial statements contained elsewhere in this filing  net of capitalized interest costs that are related to construction expenditures during the construction period of capital projects 
other income expense 
other income consists of interest income earned on our cash balances and any other non operating income activity  including insurance proceeds from litigation efforts 
other expense consists of any non operating costs  including permanent impairments of reported investments and settlement costs from litigation efforts

our net sales were million  with total shipments of million net tons during  as compared to net sales of million  with total shipments of million net tons during  an increase in net sales of million  or  and an increase in total shipments of  net tons  or 
the entire steel industry experienced pricing declines from the second half of throughout  reaching the low in the fourth quarter of however  during  prices of domestic flat rolled steel  which accounted for of our consolidated net sales during the year  increased dramatically to more normalized levels for reasons previously described 
during  our average consolidated selling price per ton increased approximately  or  in comparison to cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold was million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or  which was due in large part to record sales and production volumes 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold represented approximately and during the years and  respectively 
we experienced a narrowing of our gross margin throughout as our average sales price per ton decreased more rapidly than our average metallic raw material cost per ton  which is the most significant single component of our cost of goods sold 
however  during  our gross margin strengthened as our average product pricing increased by a greater degree than our average metallic costs and as we realized greater operating efficiencies through increased production 
metallic raw materials represented and of our cost of goods sold during and  respectively 
we experienced a steady decline in metallic costs from the second quarter of through the first quarter of  at which time this downward trend ended 
our average metallic raw material cost per hot band ton produced was  or  higher during than during selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
a portion of these expenses in both years was attributable to performance related employee incentive programs  facility start up costs  and litigation costs associated with the nakornthai strip mill public company ltd  or nsm  litigation efforts 
costs associated with our performance related employee profit sharing plan increased approximately million during our record earnings year of  as compared to during the first six months of  costs associated with start up activities at our structural and rail division were million compared to start up costs during of million  of which million related to the structural and rail division and million related to iron dynamics 
litigation costs associated with the nsm litigation efforts were  and million during and  respectively

interest expense 
interest expense was million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
during  gross interest expense increased to million and capitalized interest decreased to million  as compared to the increase in our gross interest expense  despite the decrease in our total debt  was due to an increase in our average interest rate caused by the march refinancing  in which we accessed traditionally higher priced public debt markets 
the decrease in our capitalized interest resulted from the reduction of interest required to be capitalized with respect to our structural and rail division since construction was substantially complete at june  other income expense 
other expense was million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million 
on may   we settled the remaining lawsuit associated with the nsm litigation 
we recorded settlement costs of million and million  net of any insurance proceeds  in association with the nsm related lawsuits during and  respectively 
income taxes 
during  our income tax provision was million  less a million tax benefit related to our extraordinary loss on debt extinguishments  during  as compared to million during our effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
during  we recorded a million deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits that may not be fully realized 
this allowance is still outstanding at december  extraordinary items 
during  we recorded an extraordinary loss of million  less a related tax benefit of million  related to the write off of deferred financing costs due to our march and december refinancing activities 
vs 
net sales 
our net sales were million  with total shipments of million net tons during  as compared to net sales of million  with total shipments of million net tons during  a decrease in net sales of million  or  and an increase in total shipments of  net tons  or 
the entire steel industry experienced pricing declines from the second half of throughout  reaching the low in the fourth quarter of during  the average selling price per ton decreased approximately  or  in comparison to the same period in  resulting in a decline in net sales despite a increase in net shipments 
heidtman  our largest customer  accounted for approximately and of our net sales during and  respectively 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold was million during  as compared to million during  a decrease of million  or 
metallic raw materials represented approximately and of the total cost of goods sold during and  respectively 
we experienced a steady decline in our metallic raw material pricing from the second quarter of throughout  reaching the low in the fourth quarter of the costs associated with these metals averaged  or  per ton less during than during as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold represented approximately and for the years and  respectively 
we experienced a narrowing of our gross margin throughout as our average sales price per ton decreased more rapidly than our average metallic raw material cost per ton 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
a substantial portion of these expenses in both years was attributable to costs associated with the nsm litigation efforts and start up costs associated with iron dynamics and the structural and rail mill 
litigation costs associated with the nsm litigation efforts were million for  as compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
start up costs were million  of which iron dynamics represents million including million of interest expense  during  as compared to total start up costs of million  of which iron dynamics represents million  during  a decrease of  or 
during  we also recorded bad debt expense of million  as compared to  during  an increase of million 
approximately million of this increase in bad debt expense was the result of two flat roll division customers declaring bankruptcy during as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses represented approximately and during and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense was million during  as compared to million during  a decrease of million  or 
gross interest expense decreased to million and capitalized interest decreased to million  for  as compared to throughout  base interest rates  more specifically libor and prime rates  steadily decreased in comparison to levels  resulting in the decrease in our gross interest expense despite a increase in our total net debt total debt  including other long term contingent liabilities  less cash and cash equivalents 
other income expense 
other expense was million during  as compared to  during  an increase of million 
during  we recorded settlement costs  along with the offsetting insurance proceeds  associated with settlements of a portion of the nsm related lawsuits 
on march   we settled one of two remaining nsm related lawsuits  which was outstanding on december  accordingly  we reflected a settlement cost of million  which represents the settlement amount not covered by insurance proceeds  in our financial results for during  other expense included the write off of the remaining investment in nsm of approximately million 
income taxes 
our income tax provision was million  with an effective tax rate of  during  as compared to million  with an effective tax rate of  during during  we recorded a million deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits that may not be fully realized 
this allowance was offset by a million reduction in the effective tax rate applied to our cumulative net deferred tax liability 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for  among other things  the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws 
our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures  working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness 
we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations  equity  long term borrowings  state and local grants and capital cost reimbursements 
cash flows during  cash provided by operating activities was million  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or  primarily driven by our increases in earnings during cash used in investing activities for capital investments was million and million for and  respectively 
approximately of our capital investment costs during were incurred in the construction of our structural and rail division and approximately were used to purchase our bar division assets in pittsboro  indiana 
cash used in financing activities was million during and cash provided by financing activities was million during our decrease in funds due to financing activities during resulted from our change in capital structure during march and december and from a decrease in iron dynamics debt due to an agreement with the iron dynamics senior bank lenders to extinguish million of senior secured debt  during march we also spent million on costs related to our march and december refinancing activities  in which we accessed the public debt markets for the first time 
these refinancings allowed us to lengthen scheduled debt amortizations and achieve greater financial flexibility through further capital diversification 
during  we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements of approximately million 
based on our current abatements and utilizing our existing long lived asset structure  we estimate the remaining annual effect on future operations to be approximately million  million  million  million      and  during the years through  respectively 
liquidity we believe the principal indicators of our liquidity are our cash position  remaining availability under our bank credit facilities and excess working capital 
during  our cash position decreased million to million and our working capital position increased million to million  as compared to december  as of december   million under our senior secured revolving credit facility remained undrawn and available 
our ability to draw down the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in our senior secured credit agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december   and expect to be in compliance during in march  we issued million of senior unsecured notes and we entered into a new million senior secured credit agreement in order to refinance our existing senior secured and unsecured credit facilities and to obtain additional working capital 
the million credit facility was made available to us as million in the form of a five year revolving credit facility  million in the form of a five year term a loan and million in the form of a six year term b loan 
the new senior secured credit agreement is secured by liens and mortgages on substantially all of our personal and real property assets  by liens and mortgages on substantially all of the personal and real property assets of our wholly owned subsidiaries and by pledges of all shares of capital stock and inter company debt held by us and each wholly owned subsidiary 
in addition  our wholly owned subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the new senior secured credit agreement 
the new senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness  permit liens on our property  enter into transactions with affiliates  make restricted payments or investments  enter into mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  conduct asset sales  pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities 
we are also required to prepay any amounts that we borrowed with the proceeds we receive from a number of specified events or transactions 
in december and january  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes in order to refinance million of our senior secured term a loan and million of our senior secured term b loan 
holders of our notes may convert the notes into a maximum of million shares of our common stock under certain circumstances based on  among other things  the market price of our common stock  the assigned credit rating of our notes  and certain other circumstances as defined within the prospectus 
during  we recorded an extraordinary loss of million  less a related tax benefit of million  related to the write off of deferred financing costs due to the march and december refinancing activities 
on january   we entered into an agreement with the iron dynamics lenders to extinguish the debt under the idi senior secured credit agreement at the end of march we complied with each of the settlement requirements  thus constituting full and final settlement of all of iron dynamics obligations and steel dynamics guarantees under the iron dynamics credit agreement 
in meeting the requirements of the settlement agreement  we paid million in cash and issued an aggregate of million  or million shares  of our treasury stock during march in addition  if iron dynamics resumes operations by january   and generates positive cash flow as defined in the settlement agreement  we are required to make contingent future payments in an aggregate not to exceed million 
the contingent future payments are non interest bearing and have been classified as non current  since no payments are expected to be required during our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance  which in turn  will depend upon general economic  financial and business conditions  along with competition  legislation and regulation  factors that are largely beyond our control 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future 
we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement  will be adequate for the next two years for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and for funding anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
effective june   the board of directors authorized the extension and continuation of our share repurchase program  allowing us to repurchase an additional  or million shares  of our outstanding common stock at a purchase price not to exceed per share 
at december   we had acquired million shares of our common stock in open market purchases  of which  shares were purchased during  none were purchased during  and million shares were purchased during the average price per share of these purchases is as of december   approximately  shares remain available for repurchase under the june repurchase authorization 
other matters inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
environmental and other contingencies we have incurred  and in the future will continue to incur  capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control  remediation  monitoring and compliance 
we believe  apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities  such as our planned bar division in pittsboro  indiana  that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  however  environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
fas  rescission of fasb statements no 
   amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement  among other things  rescinds fas  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of the related income tax effect 
we intend to adopt fas as of january   as required 
upon adoption  any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in apb for classification as an extraordinary item  will be reclassified as income or loss from continuing operations 
we have determined that the adoption of fas will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in of million  net of related tax of million  will no longer be classified as an extraordinary item in our financial statements  rather  it will be included in our income from operations 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
fas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
fas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  fas may affect the timing of our recognition of future exit or disposal costs  if any 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires companies  at the time certain guarantees are issued  to recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations assumed under the guarantee 
fin also provides guidance concerning existing disclosure requirements related to guarantees and warranties 
the initial recognition requirements of fin are effective for guarantees issued or modified after december   and adoption of the disclosure requirements is effective for us as of december  we believe the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we generally recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when the product is shipped 
provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience 
if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends  additional provision may be necessary 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
impairments of long lived assets 
in accordance with the methodology described in fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
during  events and circumstances indicated that approximately million of assets related to iron dynamics might be impaired 
however  our estimate of undiscounted cash flows was approximately million in excess of such carrying amounts and  therefore  no charge has been recorded at december  we made various assumptions in estimating the undiscounted cash flows  including  among other things  a weighted average of the most likely achieved production levels  significant cost components  required capital expenditures and a date for resumption of commercial production 
nonetheless  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows may change in the near term due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  and changes in the business model or changes in operating performance  resulting in the need to write down those assets to fair value 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we had available foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes  which expire in due to the limited time frame remaining to utilize the foreign tax credits and the decreased likelihood that the net operating losses will be fully absorbed prior to the expiration of the credits  a valuation allowance of million was created in even if these credits are not utilized as such  they can be treated as tax deductible expenses 
therefore  million of foreign tax credit remains as a deferred tax asset as of december  contingent liabilities 
the accrual of a contingency involves considerable judgment on the part of management 
we use outside experts  such as lawyers  as necessary to aid in the estimation of the probability that a loss will occur and the amount or range of that potential loss 
during  we were sued by institutional purchasers in a note offering by certain investment banks on behalf of nsm  the owner and operator of a steel mini mill in thailand for whom we agreed to render certain post offering technical and operational advisory services 
during the second and third quarters of  we settled seven of the nine pending lawsuits  and in the first half of  we settled the two remaining lawsuits  in each case without any admission of liability and  to the extent of any monetary payments  except for approximately million recorded in and million recorded in the first quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk in the normal course of business we are exposed to interest rate changes 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 
we generally maintain fixed rate debt as a percentage of our net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage 
a portion of our debt has an interest component that resets on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions 
the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date for our long term debt as of december  in millions interest rate risk fixed rate variable rate average average expected maturity date principal rate principal rate thereafter total fair value
