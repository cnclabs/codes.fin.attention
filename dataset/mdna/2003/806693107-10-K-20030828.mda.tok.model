we market our branded nutritional supplement products  both domestically and internationally  in five principal categories specialty supplements  vitamins and minerals  sports nutrition  weight management  and nutrition bars 
our operating results for fiscal  and were affected by an industry slow down including lack of successful new product introductions  increased competitive pressures particularly from increasing private label growth  the implementation of our schiff move free initiatives to defend the brand against the competition  the sale of our american body building and science foods brands  the reorganization of the company into three business units and the impact of certain other unusual items 
on july   we announced the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain associated liabilities relating to our american body building and science foods brands 
the sales price included approximately million in cash and the assumption of an approximate  mortgage on the accompanying beverage facility 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax impairment loss of approximately million during the fiscal fourth quarter  primarily associated with the write off of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on may  the first day of haleko s fiscal year  we sold substantially all of the assets relating to haleko s germany based venice beach sports apparel brand 
the transaction included the sale of venice beach receivables  inventories  intellectual property and certain fixed assets and the assumption by the purchaser of approximately venice beach employees

the active nutrition unit includes weider branded global businesses  our tiger s milk brand and our export business which includes weider and schiff branded produts

the reorganization resulted in an approximate million charge during the fiscal second quarter  primarily associated with employee severance costs 
we adopted eitf no 
effective march   and reclassified prior period amounts as required by the new accounting standard 
the adoption of eitf no 
did not materially impact overall results of operations 
however  the cost of certain sales incentives or promotional considerations previously recognized as operating expenses were reclassified as reductions in net sales and or increases in cost of goods sold 
as a result of our adoption of eitf no 
 gross profit for fiscal and decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  and selling and marketing expenses decreased by the same amounts for the respective periods 
on june   we adopted sfas no 
and recognized an after tax goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
factors affecting our historical results  including the previous implementation of strategic initiatives as well continuing refinement of our growth and business strategies  are ongoing considerations and processes 
while the focus of these considerations are to improve future profitability  no assurance can be given that our decisions relating to these initiatives will not adversely effect our results of operations or financial condition

effective may   we amended the credit facility whereby the outstanding balance of the term loan was reduced to million and the aggregate revolving loan availability was reduced to million 
during the fiscal second quarter  the outstanding balance of the term loan was paid in full with funds available under our revolving loan 
under the revolving loan  as amended  we may borrow up to the lesser of million or the sum of i of eligible accounts receivable and ii the lesser of million or of the eligible inventory 
the credit facility contains customary terms and conditions  including  among others  financial covenants regarding minimum cash flows and limitations on indebtedness and our ability to pay dividends under certain circumstances 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on all owned or acquired tangible and intangible assets of our domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility  which expires in march  is being used to fund our normal working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
net proceeds from the sale of our american body building and science foods brands were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility 
at may   available revolving loan funds were approximately million 
our domestic operations were also supported by a subordinated loan the subordinated loan obtained in conjunction with the credit facility 
the subordinated loan  in the original amount of million  contained customary terms and conditions  including  among others  financial covenants regarding minimum cash flows and limitations on indebtedness and our ability to pay dividends under certain circumstances 
effective may   we used funds available under our revolving loan to pay down million of the subordinated loan 
effective november   we used funds available under our revolving loan to pay off the remaining million of the subordinated loan 
our european working capital needs primarily our haleko business unit are supported by a germany based secured credit facility the haleko facility that is subject to annual renewal in june 
our obligations under the haleko facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all haleko tangible and intangible assets 
at may   the outstanding balance of the haleko facility was million and available revolving loan funds were approximately million 
net proceeds from the sale of our venice beach sports apparel business were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under the haleko facility 
during june  we renewed the haleko facility with deutsche bank ag in the approximate amount of million at recent exchange rate 
we believe that our cash  cash flows from operations and the financing sources discussed above will be sufficient to meet our normal cash operating requirements during the next twelve months 
however  we continue to review opportunities to acquire or invest in companies  product rights and other investments that are compatible with our existing business 
we could use cash and financing sources discussed herein  or financing sources that subsequently become available  to fund additional acquisitions or investments 
in addition  we may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or growth  or to refinance existing debt 
if a material acquisition or investment is completed  our operating results and financial condition could change materially in future periods 
however  no assurance can be given that additional funds will be available on satisfactory terms  or at all  to fund such activities 
in february  we announced the suspension of the quarterly dividend on our common stock 
our board of directors will determine dividend policy in the future based upon  among other factors  results of operations  financial condition  contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant at the time 
in addition  our credit facilities contain certain customary financial covenants that may limit our ability to pay common stock dividends 
we can give no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future 
a summary of our outstanding long term debt and operating lease contractual obligations at may  is as follows in thousands contractual cash obligations total amounts committed less than year years years after years long term debt   operating leases      total obligations      critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments related to valuation of inventories  allowances for doubtful accounts  notes receivable and sales returns  valuation of deferred tax assets and recoverability of long lived assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgements used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements we provide an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs would be required 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  notes receivable and sales returns for estimated losses resulting from known customer exposures  including product returns and inability to make payments 
we also consider collateral values and other factors in evaluating collectibility of notes receivable 
actual results may differ resulting in adjustment of the respective allowance s 
we currently have deferred tax assets resulting from certain loss carryforwards and other temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting 
these deferred tax assets are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
the realization of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future operating results 
to the extent we are uncertain whether future operations will generate sufficient profit to utilize the loss carryforwards  valuation allowances are established 
we have significant intangible assets  including trademarks  patents and goodwill 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgements 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgements and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
impact of inflation historically  we have been able to pass inflationary increases for raw materials and other costs onto our customers through price increases and we anticipate that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
seasonality our business can be seasonal  with fluctuations in sales resulting from timing of marketing and promotional activities  customer buying patterns and consumer spending patterns 
in addition  as a result of changes in product sales mix and other factors  as discussed above  we experience fluctuations in gross profit and operating margins on a quarter to quarter basis
