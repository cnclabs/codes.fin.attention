item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
the following text contains references to years   and  which mean our fiscal years ending or ended january   december   december  and december   respectively 
we use a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december consequently  we periodically have a week fiscal year 
our  and fiscal years were all week years 
our fiscal year will be a week year 
all share and per share data has been adjusted to reflect the two for one common stock split that we paid on april  as previously discussed in our form k  we announced in march that we had identified certain accounting errors at one of our operating subsidiaries in our broadline segment 
we found that the principal accounting staff at the subsidiary failed to appropriately reconcile accounting systems designed to track vendor rebate transactions  certain inventory transactions and intercompany transactions with a division of that subsidiary  which resulted in an understatement of costs of goods sold for the subsidiary 
we believe that the errors were perpetuated because the accounting staff at the subsidiary made monthly journal entries in the subsidiary s accounting records to produce what appeared to be correct financial statements for the subsidiary  but they failed to properly reconcile the accounting records to supporting detail 
the effect of the correction of the errors was included in our form k 
we have taken remedial actions to address these accounting errors 
those remedial actions include terminating and replacing certain accounting staff at the subsidiary  increasing our internal audit staff  expanding our internal audit work programs  developing an enhanced schedule of on site review at our subsidiaries conducted by our outside auditors and our internal audit staff  enhancing the quarterly review procedures at our operating subsidiaries  increasing coordination between our central accounting staff and the accounting staff located at each of our operating subsidiaries  adding a chief financial officer for our broadline division  and implementing a new internal financial reporting system to automate and enhance financial reporting by our subsidiaries  including automated notification to our central accounting staff when the general ledgers of certain subsidiaries do not reconcile with their accounting subsystems 
introduction performance food group was founded in as a result of the combination of various foodservice businesses  and has grown both internally through increased sales to existing and new customers and through acquisitions of existing businesses 
we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of food and non food products to the foodservice  or food away from home  industry 
we also sell pre cut produce to food retailers 
the principal components of our expenses include cost of goods sold  which represents the amounts paid to manufacturers and growers for products sold  and operating expenses  which include primarily labor related expenses  delivery costs and occupancy expenses related to our facilities 
a portion of our growth in net sales during the years discussed below was due to acquisitions 
the business combinations section below summarizes our acquisitions since the beginning of according to data compiled by a market research firm  consumer purchases of food away from home in the united states currently represent approximately of consumer spending on food purchases and are predicted to represent of total us projected consumer food and beverage spending by  surpassing retail in its share of the consumer food dollar 
we believe the trends that are fueling the demand for food away from home include the aging baby boomer generation 
according to industry research  older adults on average spend significantly more dollars on food away from home than younger adults do 
industry research shows that rising incomes and the increase in the number of women working also contribute to the growth in food away from home 
in addition  our fresh express branded products that are sold by retailers are targeting ready to eat convenience foods  which we believe is one of the fastest growing categories for retailers 
we believe that  over the last sever al years  we have experienced significantly greater growth rates than the us foodservice industry as a whole  both through internal growth and through an active acquisition program 
while recent weakness in the us economy has impacted our recent levels of internal growth  our strategy is to continue to grow our foodservice business through both internal growth and acquisitions  and to improve our operating profit margin 
over the past decade  we have supplemented our internal growth through selective  strategic acquisitions 
we believe that the consolidation trends in the foodservice distribution industry will continue to present acquisition opportunities for us 
results of operations net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating profit other expense  net earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings springfield foodservice ammonia leak on july   we discovered an ammonia leak in the refrigeration system at our springfield foodservice facility in massachusetts 
springfield foodservice resumed limited shipments of non refrigerated products from the facility within a week of the incident  and resumed shipments of refrigerated and frozen products within two weeks of the incident 
our broadline facilities based in maine and new jersey were able to service certain of the customers normally served by the springfield foodservice facility until the facility became fully operational 
although there were no injuries and the leak was confined to the facility  the leak did cause physical damage at the facility and affected the sales and operating profit of our broadline segment 
we estimate the impact in related to the ammonia leak at the springfield foodservice facility to be approximately million before taxes 
cost of goods sold in our broadline segment included million of damaged inventory  net of million of insurance coverage 
other costs of million were included in operating expenses in our broadline segment 
operating profit was affected by an additional approximately million related to the estimated impact of the interruption on springfield foodservice s operations 
we are continuing to pursue additional recoveries  if any  which may be available under our insurance policies 
comparison of to net sales 
net sales increased billion  or  to billion for from billion for net sales in our existing operations increased over  while acquisitions contributed the remaining of our total net sales growth for net sales in existing operations exclude the net sales of an acquired business for the first months following the acquisition date of that business 
we estimate that food price inflation was nominal in on a consolidated basis 
sales for the second half of were impacted by the terrorist attacks of september   while the continued softness in restaurant sales  including quick service restaurant sales  affected our sales growth 
our broadline segment net sales of billion in represented of our consolidated net sales  down from of our consolidated net sales in the decrease as a percentage of our consolidated net sales is due primarily to the acquisition of fresh international corp  referred to as fresh express  in the fourth quarter of  which is reported in the fresh cut segment 
our acquisition of fresh express is discussed in further detail in business combinations 
broadline net sales increased million  or  to billion in from billion in we estimate that our broadline segment experienced food price inflation of approximately in net sales in our existing broadline operations for increased over the rate of growth in our sales in existing broadline operations declined from primarily as a result of the continued softness in restaurant sales 
broadline sales at our existing operations in were driven both by increased sales to existing customers and sales to new customers 
acquisitions contributed the remaining of our total broadline sales growth for broadline acquisition sales growth was the result of our acquisitions of empire seafood holding corp 
and empire imports  inc  collectively empire seafood  in april  springfield foodservice corporation in september  quality foods  inc in may  and middendorf meat company and thoms proestler company and tpc logistics  inc  collectively thoms proestler  in july our acquisitions of empire seafood  springfield foodservice  quality foods  middendorf and thoms proestler are discussed in business combinations 
our customized segment net sales of billion in represented of our consolidated net sales  down from in the decrease as a percentage of our consolidated net sales is due primarily to the acquisition of fresh express in our fresh cut segment and the acquisitions of thoms proestler  middendorf and quality foods in our broadline segment 
customized net sales increased to billion in from billion in this increase in net sales is the result of a new casual dining chain customer  ruby tuesday  in the fourth quarter of  the addition of more ruby tuesday restaurants in the third quarter of  the addition of tgi friday s restaurants in the fourth quarter of and the continued growth in sales to existing customers 
we began shipping to some of the additional ruby tuesday and tgi friday s restaurants in the fourth quarter of and will begin shipping to the remaining restaurants in the first quarter of we expec t these additional ruby tuesday and tgi friday s restaurants to contribute approximately million and million in annual net sales  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we discontinued our relationship with avado brands  inc  which accounted for million  or  of our net sales in we estimate that our customized segment experienced food product deflation of approximately in in  we will begin shipping to mimi s caf restaurants  which are expected to generate approximately million in annual net sales 
in addition  in  we were awarded an additional ruby tuesday restaurants in the midwest  to which we plan to begin shipping in the second quarter of these ruby tuesday locations are expected to generate approximately million in annual net sales 
our fresh cut segment net sales of million represented of our consolidated net sales  up from of our consolidated net sales in fresh cut net sales increased to million in from million in net sales in our existing fresh cut operations for increased over  while the acquisition of fresh express in the fourth quarter of contributed the remaining of our total fresh cut sales growth for the rate of sales growth in the foodservice portion of our fresh cut segment declined from as a result of slower sales in the quick service restaurant industry and the loss of sales to independent foodservice distributors  primarily as a result of our acquisition of fresh express 
the increase in sales in our existing operations for is due primarily to increased sales of premium lettuce to quick service restaurants and increased sales of sliced tomatoes to additional locations of existing and new customers 
we estimate that our fresh cut segment experienced food product inflation of approximately in cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased million  or  to billion in from billion in as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased to in compared to in in  cost of goods sold in our broadline segment included million related to damaged inventory  net of million of insurance coverage attributable to the ammonia leak at our springfield foodservice facility 
the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales is also due to the acquisition of fresh express  which typically has had a lower ratio of cost of goods sold to net sales than many of our other operating companies 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in gross profit margin  which we define as gross profit as a percentage of net sales  increased to in compared to in the increase in gross profit margin was due primarily to our acquisition of fresh express  which typically has had higher gross profit margins than many of our other operating companies 
our increase in gross profit margin was partially offset by the acquisition of quality foods in may  which has lower gross profit margins than our other broadline companies  and by the impact of the springfield foodservice ammonia leak 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses increased to in from in the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was due mainly to our acquisition of fresh express  which has higher operating expense levels than our foodservice distribution business

operating profit margin  adjusting for the impact of sfas no 
 would have been in the increase in operating profit margin on a comparable basis  from in to in  is due primarily to a higher percentage of our consolidated net sales from the fresh cut segment  which has a higher operating profit margin than our distribution business 
operating profit margin in our broadline segment remained at in operating profit for includes the impact of approximately million attributable to the springfield foodservice ammonia leak 
operating profit margin in was affected by our acquisition of quality foods in may  which has a lower operating profit margin than our other broadline companies 
operating profit margin in our broadline segment  adjusting for the impact of sfas no 
 would have been for thus  on a comparable basis  operating profit margin declined to in from in this decline was due primarily to the springfield foodservice ammonia leak and the acquisition of quality foods  discussed above 
operating profit margins in our customized segment increased to in from in  mainly as the result of changes in customer mix 
our adoption of sfas no

operating profit margin in our fresh cut segment remained at for operating profit margin in the fresh cut segment  adjusted for the impact of sfas no 
 would have been for thus  on a comparable basis  operating profit margin declined to in from in this decline in operating profit margin is partially due to our acquisition of fresh express in october  which has lower operating margins than the rest of our fresh cut segment  continued softness in the quick service restaurant business and costs associated with a retail consumer test of a fresh cut fruit product line  real fresh fruit we incurred start up expenses of million in the second half of related to this new product development 
we expect costs associated with the test of fresh cut fruit to continue to impact the operating profit margin of our fresh cut segment through other expense  net 
other expense  net  increased to million in from million in included in other expense  net  was interest expense of million in  compared to interest expense of million in interest expense was higher in primarily because of the issuance in october of million of convertible notes and higher average borrowing levels in to fund our acquisitions  partially offset by lower interest rates

diluted net earnings per common share  or eps  is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders plus dilutive after tax interest on the convertible notes numerator by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted eps increased to in  compared to in in october  we issued the convertible notes 
after tax interest expense of million and common share equivalents of million related to the convertible notes are included in the calculation of diluted eps in because of their dilutive effect on eps 
for  the convertible notes and related interest expense were excluded from the calculation of diluted eps because of their antidilutive effect on eps 
comparison of to net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to billion in from billion for net sales in our existing operations increased over  while acquisitions contributed the remaining of our total net sales growth for we estimate that inflation contributed approximately to the increase in net sales in on a consolidated basis 
during  the growth in net sales in our existing operations was below the growth rate experienced in  reflecting weaker general economic conditions in the latter half of and the impact of the terrorist attacks of september  also in  our growth rate was favorably impacted by the addition of two significant customers  burger king and tgi friday s in our broadline and customized segments  respectively 
sales to these customers contributed approximately of the growth rate of sales from existing operations in our broadline segment net sales of billion in represented of our consolidated net sales  down from of our consolidated net sales in the decrease as a percentage of our consolidated net sales is due primarily to the acquisition of redi cut foods  inc and its affiliates  kansas city salad  llc and llc salad real estate  llc  collectively  redi cut  in december  which is reported in the fresh cut segment

diluted eps increased to in  compared to in for  the convertible notes were excluded from the calculation of diluted eps because of their antidilutive effect on eps 
because the convertible notes were issued in  they were not included in the calculation of diluted eps for liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities  the issuance of long term debt  operating leases  normal trade credit terms and the sale of our common stock 
despite our growth in net sales  we have reduced our working capital needs by financing our investment in inventory principally with accounts payable and outstanding checks in excess of deposits 
we typically fund our acquisitions  and expect to fund future acquisitions  with our existing cash  additional borrowings under our credit facility and the issuance of debt or equity securities 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   a decrease of million from december  the decrease was primarily a result of cash used in investing activities of million  partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of million  borrowings under our credit facility of million and an increase in outstanding checks in excess of deposits of million

cash used in financing activities in included payments of million on our existing revolving credit facility and debt issuance costs of million related to our convertible notes and our credit facility 
cash provided by financing activities was million in in  cash flows from financing activities included proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock in december  an increase in outstanding checks in excess of deposits of million  net borrowings of million on our revolving credit facility  million of proceeds from industrial revenue bonds issued to finance the construction of a new produce processing facility  and proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in  cash used by financing activities included million paid by us to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market for use in connection with our employee benefit plans 
the issuance of the convertible notes and common stock and our credit facility are discussed in detail in financing activities 
financing activities in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes and from our concurrent offering of common stock  discussed below  were used to repay our borrowings then outstanding under our existing revolving credit facility and to fund the acquisition of fresh express 
the convertible notes are subordinate to all existing and future senior debt and are convertible at any time until maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the convertible notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at any time on or after october  each holder of the convertible notes has the right to cause us to repurchase all of such holder s convertible notes at of their principal amount plus accrued interest upon a change of control of the company  as defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes  and upon the occurrence of certain other events 
interest is payable semiannually 
in october  we also issued million shares of our common stock 
the proceeds from this offering of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses  and proceeds from the concurrent offering of convertible notes were used to fund the acquisition of fresh express and to repay borrowings then outstanding under our existing revolving credit facility 
also in october  we entered into our million credit facility with several financial institutions which replaced our existing million credit facility and million working capital line of credit 
the credit facility expires in and bears interest at a floating rate equal to  at our election  the agent bank s prime rate or a spread over libor  which varies based upon our leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit facility has a commitment fee  ranging from to of the average daily unused portion of the total facility  based on our leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit facility also requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios  as defined in the credit agreement  and contains customary events of default 
the credit facility allows for the issuance of up to million of standby letters of credit  which reduce borrowings available under the credit facility 
at december   we had millio n of outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility 
the credit facility also requires that our existing and future subsidiaries that engage in any business operation or own assets with a fair market value in excess of million  guarantee all of our borrowings  letters of credit and other obligations under the credit facility 
at december   we had million outstanding under the credit facility and million available under the credit facility  subject to compliance with customary borrowing conditions 
at december   our borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at per annum 
in december  we issued million shares of our common stock generating proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses  of million  which we used to pay the cash portion of the purchase price of redi cut and repay borrowings then outstanding under our existing credit facility 
in march  one of our subsidiaries issued million of tax exempt industrial revenue bonds to finance the construction of a produce processing facility 
in january  we refinanced these bonds with the proceeds of million taxable revenue bonds  in order to free us from certain restrictive covenants applicable to the subsidiary that issued the tax exempt bonds 
like the tax exempt bonds  these taxable bonds bear interest at a rate determined weekly by the remarketing agent for the bonds  are secured by a letter of credit issued by a commercial bank and mature in march the interest rate for these bonds was per annum at december  we believe that our cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and the sale of undivided interests in trade receivables under the receivables facility  discussed below  will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
however  we will likely require additional sources of financing to the extent that we make additional acquisitions in the future 
off balance sheet activities we utilize two sources of funding that could generally be described as off balance sheet financing the receivables facility and two master operating lease facilities 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the receivables facility and the two master operating lease facilities 
the receivables facility represents off balance sheet financing because the transaction and the financial institution s ownership interest in certain of our accounts receivable results in assets being removed from our balance sheet to the extent that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles 
this treatment requires us to account for the transaction with the financial institution as a sale of the undivided interest in the accounts receivable instead of reflecting the financial institution s net investment of million as debt 
in july  we entered into the receivables facility  under which pfg receivables corporation  a wholly owned  special purpose subsidiary  sold an undivided interest in certain of our trade receivables 
pfg receivables corporation was formed for the sole purpose of buying receivables generated by certain of our operating units and selling an undivided interest in those receivables to a financial institution 
under the receivables facility  our operating units sell a portion of their accounts receivable to pfg receivables corporation  which in turn  subject to certain conditions  may from time to time sell an undivided interest in these receivables to a financial institution 
our operating units continue to service the receivables on behalf of the financial institution at estimated market rates 
accordingly  we have not recognized a servicing asset or liability 
the amount of the undivided interest in the receivables owned by the financial institution cannot exceed million at a ny one time 
on july   we extended our receivables facility through july  we record the sale of the undivided interest in accounts receivable to the financial institution according to sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
accordingly  at the time the undivided interest in accounts receivables is sold  the receivables are removed from our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a loss on the sale of the undivided interest in the receivables  which includes a discount  based upon the receivables credit quality and a financing cost for the financial institution  based upon a day commercial paper rate 
at december   the rate under the receivables facility was per annum 
we received million of proceeds from the sale of the undivided interest in receivables under the receivables facility in  and we continued to securitize accounts receivable throughout and at december   securitized accounts receivable totaled million  which included million sold to the financial institution and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet and included our residual interest in accounts receivable of million  which is included in accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet 
the residual interest represents our retained interest in receivables held by pfg receivables corporation 
we measured the residual interest using the estimated discounted cash flows of the underlying accounts receivable  based on estimated collections and a discount rate approximately equivalent to our incremental borrowing rate 
the loss on sale of the undivided interest in receivables of million in is included in other expense  net  in our consolidated statement of earnings and represents our cost of securitizing those receivables with the financial institution 
we have two master operating lease facilities 
in september  we entered into our first master operating lease facility  referred to as the first facility  to construct or purchase various distribution centers and processing plants 
in february  we increased the first facility from million to million 
on september   the lessor sold one processing plant previously included in the first facility to a third party unaffiliated with us 
we concurrently entered into an operating lease with that unaffiliated third party for the same processing plant 
the operating lease has an initial term of years  plus five renewal options of five years each 
on september   the original expiration date of the leases in the first facility  we extended the expiration date of the remaining leases in this facility to june   and decreased the size of this facility to million 
at december   the first facility included three distribution centers  and construction expenditures by the lessor under the first facility for these three centers totaled million 
in june  we entered into a million master operating lease facility  referred to as the second facility  to construct or purchase various office buildings and distribution centers 
on september   the lessor sold one distribution center previously included in the second facility to a third party unaffiliated with us 
we concurrently entered into an operating lease with that unaffiliated third party for the same distribution center 
the operating lease has an initial term of years  plus five renewal options of five years each 
on september   we reduced the size of this facility to million 
as of december   the second facility included two distribution centers and one office building 
the leases relating to these three properties  as well as any other leases that we may enter into under this facility in the future  end on june  through december   construction expenditures by the lessor under the second facility totaled mi llion 
under both of these master operating lease facilities  the lessor owns the distribution centers and office building  incurs the related debt to construct the properties  and thereafter leases each property to us 
we have entered into leases for each of the properties in these facilities 
upon the expiration of the leases under the first and second facilities  we may seek to renew the leases 
if we are unable to or choose not to renew the leases  we have the option of facilitating the sale of the properties to third parties or purchasing the properties at their original cost 
if the properties in the first facility and the second facility are sold to third parties for less than their aggregate original cost  we are obligated  under residual value guarantees  to pay the lessor an amount equal to the lesser of either the shortfall or and  respectively  of original cost 
we may not be able to renew the leases or sell the properties to third parties  and we may require substantial additional financing if we are required to purchase these properties upon the expiration of the master operating lease facilities 
because of the location and condition of each of the distribution centers and office building in the first and second facilities  we believe that the anticipated fair value of these properties could eliminate or substantially reduce our exposure under the residual value guarantees 
our leases under the two master operating lease facilities qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
therefore  the buildings and the debt incurred to construct them of million as of december   were not included on our consolidated balance sheet 
in the third quarter of  we will be required to adopt the provisions of financial interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
under the current structure of our first and second facilities  we will be required to consolidate these facilities upon the adoption of fin if consolidated  our property  plant and equipment and current and long term debt will increase on our consolidated balance sheet 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations at december   our fresh cut segment had contracts to purchase produce totaling million 
these contracts expire at various times throughout and amounts due under these contracts were not included on our consolidated balance sheet at december   in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the table below presents contractual minimum cash obligations under all of our existing debt  including capital leases  and operating lease agreements and produce purchase obligations as of december  lease payments include payments due under our existing non cancelable operating leases  including lease payments under our two master operating lease facilities 
this table should be read in conjunction with notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total in addition to the above minimum cash obligations  in connection with certain acquisitions  we have entered into earnout agreements with certain of the former owners of the businesses that we have acquired 
these agreements are based upon certain net earnings and synergy targets  as defined in each agreement  and discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these earnout payments are for companies acquired from to  and may include payments in cash and or shares of our common stock 
as of december   the maximum potential earnout obligation  assuming all future earnout targets are met in their earliest possible years  totaled million million in  million in  million in and million in these contingent payments are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at december   in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
if paid  these earnout payments would increase the goodwill of the companies acquired 
if the future earnout targets are not met  these maximum amounts will be lower  or we may not be required to make any payments 
our two master operating lease facilities and certain of our other operating leases  including leases of tractors and trailers  contain residual value guarantees 
these guarantees are not included in the above table and are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december   because it is not probable that the estimated residual value of the buildings and equipment will be less than the amounts stipulated in the agreements 
the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments under residual value guarantees relative to the properties in the first and second facilities is million 
as discussed above in liquidity and capital resources  we believe that the anticipated fair value of the properties in the master operating lease facilities could eliminate or substantially reduce our exposure under these residual value guarantees 
at december   the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments under our residual value guarantees for all o f our other operating leases totaled approximately million 
this maximum amount related to residual value guarantees under our operating leases would be mitigated by the fair value of the leased assets at lease expiration 
these leases have expiration dates ranging from to notes and to the consolidated financial statements provide further discussion of these guarantees and the related accounting pronouncements 
in  we will be required to record a liability on our consolidated balance sheet for the value of guarantees for new leases or for leases that are modified  as required by financial interpretation no

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare our financial statements 
management s estimates are generally based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we determine to be reasonable in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ 
we believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates include accounting for business combinations  off balance sheet fi nancing activities  allowance for doubtful accounts  incurred but not reported insurance claims  reserve for inventories  sales incentives and vendor rebates and other promotional incentives 
accounting for business combinations 
our goodwill and other intangible assets include the cost of acquired subsidiaries in excess of the fair value of the tangible net assets recorded in connection with acquisitions 
other intangible assets include trade names  trademarks  patents  non compete agreements and customer relationships 
we use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  assigning lives to acquired intangibles and evaluating those assets for impairment after acquisition 
these estimates and assumptions include indicators that would trigger an impairment of assets  whether those indicators are temporary  economic or competitive factors that affect valuation  discount rates and cash flow estimates 
when the carrying value of such assets are not expected to be recoverable  or the estimated lives assigned to such assets are determined to be improper  we must reduce the carrying value of the assets to the net realiz able value or adjust the amortization period of the asset  recording any adjustment in our consolidated statements of earnings 
as described below under recently issued accounting pronouncements  sfas no 
was effective at the beginning of  except for goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business combinations completed subsequent to june   for which the standard was effective beginning july  in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of the beginning of sfas no 
requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be tested for impairment upon adoption of this standard and at least annually thereafter  or more often if other circumstances indicate 
if goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives are impaired  the assets should be written down to their fair values 
based on our assessments as of december  and december   we did not record any impairment loss 
to perform these assessments  we compared the net assets of our broadline and fresh cu t segments individually to the expected discounted future cash flows of each segment 
a significant change in the assumptions regarding the future cash flows of either segment would require further impairment testing  which could result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
as of december   our unamortized goodwill was million and other intangible assets totaled million  net 
accounting for off balance sheet financing activities 
we have two sources of funding which could generally be described as off balance sheet financing activities the receivables facility and our two master operating lease facilities  all described in off balance sheet activities 
the sale of the undivided interest in our accounts receivable qualifies for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles  therefore  these receivables have been removed from our consolidated balance sheets 
we measure the residual interest in the undivided interest in receivables sold under our receivables facility using the estimated discounted cash flows of the underlying accounts receivable  based on estimated collections and a discount rate approximately equivalent to our incremental borrowing rate 
significant changes in our estimates and assumptions could result in a change in earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the receivables facility 
our leases under the two master operating lease facilities qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under sfas no  accounting for leases  and  as such  the buildings  and the debt incurred to construct them  are not included on our consolidated balance sheet 
under the current structure of our two master operating lease facilities  we will be required to consolidate these facilities upon the adoption of fin  discussed in recently issued accounting pronouncements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze our significant customer accounts  and when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also record reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  macroeconomic considerations and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
in  and  we wrote off uncollect ible accounts receivable of million  million and million against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in  and  we charged estimates of million  million and million  respectively  to operating expenses to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
incurred but not reported insurance claims 
we maintain a self insurance program covering portions of our general and vehicle liability  workers compensation and group medical insurance 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured  subject to certain limitations and exclusions 
we accrue an estimated liability for these self insured programs  including an estimate for incurred but not reported claims based on known claims and past claims history 
these accruals are included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets 
the provisions for insurance claims include estimates of the frequency and timing of claim occurrences  as well as the ultimate amounts to be paid 
these estimates could be significantly affected if paid claims differ from past claims history 
reserve for inventories 
we maintain reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories 
these reserves are based upon inventory category  age of inventory  specifically identified items and overall economic conditions 
a sudden and unexpected change in consumer preferences could result in a significant change in the reserve balance and a corresponding charge to earnings 
sales incentives 
we  primarily through our fresh cut segment  offer sales incentives and promotions to our customers resellers and to consumers 
these incentives primarily include volume and growth rebates  exclusivity and placement fees fees paid to retailers for product display  consumer coupons and promotional discounts 
we follow the requirements of eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
consideration given to customers and consumers related to sales incentives is recorded as a reduction of sales 
changes in the estimated amount of incentives to be paid are treated as changes in estimates and are recognized in the period of change 
the cost of volume and growth rebates and exclusivity and placement fees is recorded using a systematic and rational allocation of the cost of the incentives to each of the underlying revenue transactions that resulted in progress by the cust omer toward earning the incentives to be paid 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of future incentives to be paid to the customer  we record the maximum potential amount 
we use a customer s prior purchasing volume  as well as other factors  to assist in estimating the total incentives to be paid  if any 
the cost of consumer coupons is recorded at the later of the date the coupon is offered or the date the related revenue is recognized by us 
the amount recorded is based on the estimated amount of refunds or rebates that will be redeemed by consumers 
we primarily use historical coupon redemption data and forecasted sales volumes to estimate the amount to be redeemed 
if we cannot reasonably and reliably estimate the amount to be redeemed  we record the maximum potential amount 
promotional discounts are primarily recorded as a reduction to the customer s invoice for goods purchased based on an underlying agreement with the customer 
a change in our estimates and assumptions related to cons umer coupon redemption rates and customer purchase volumes  among other factors  may result in a change in our sales and earnings 
vendor rebates and other promotional incentives 
we participate in various rebate and promotional incentives with our suppliers  primarily including volume and growth rebates  annual and multi year incentives and promotional programs 
consideration received under these incentives is generally recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
however  in certain circumstances the consideration is recorded as a reduction of costs incurred by us 
consideration received may be in the form of cash and or invoice deductions 
changes in the estimated amount of incentives to be received are treated as changes in estimates and are recognized in the period of change 
consideration received for incentives that contain volume and growth rebates and annual and multi year incentives is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
the consideration is recorded by us based upon a systematic and rational allocation of these incentives to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by us toward earning the incentives  provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
if the incentives are not probable and reasonably estimable  we record the incentives as the underlying objectives or milestones are achieved 
we record annual and multi year incentives when earned  which is generally over the agreement period 
we use current and historical purchasing data  forecasted purchasing volumes and other factors in estimating whether the underlying objectives or milestones will be achieved 
consideration received to promote and sell the supplier s products is typically a reimbursement of costs incurred by us and is then recorded as a redu ction of our costs 
if the amount of consideration received from the suppliers exceeds our costs  any excess is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
a change to our estimates and assumptions of future purchasing volumes and the amount of promotional costs  among other factors  may result in a change in our earnings 
in january  the eitf reached a final consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
eitf no 
clarifies certain aspects for accounting and recording by customers of consideration received from suppliers 
we believe the application of eitf no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
for additional information on eitf no 
 see recently issued accounting pronouncements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the above disclosure 
in addition  our financial statements contain other items that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
these include our calculations for bonus accruals  depreciation  amortization and tax liabilities 
changes in estimates and assumptions used in these and other items could have an effect on our financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
sfas no 
requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be tested for impairment at least annually  or more often if other circumstances indicate 
if impaired  the assets should be written down to their fair values 
furthermore  sfas no 
requires intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless those lives are determined to be indefinite 
sfas no 
was effective at the beginning of  except for goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business combinations completed subsequent to june   for which the standard was effective beginning july  in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of the beginning of other intangible assets with definite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  generally three to years 
for and  we recorded amortization expense of million and million  respectively

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses accounting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and the normal operation of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense over the asset s useful life 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this statement 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires a company to recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amounts of long lived assets to be held and used are not recoverable from their expected undiscounted future cash flows 
sfas no

in november  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf no

in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses accounting for costs to terminate contracts that are not capital leases  costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees and termination benefits 
sfas no 
 effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   requires that the fair value of a liability related to penalties for early contract termination be recognized when the entity effectively terminates the contract 
the fair value of a liability for other contract termination costs should be recognized when an entity ceases using the rights conveyed by the contract 
the liability for one time termination benefits should be accrued ratably over the future service period based on when employees are entitled to receive the benefits and a minimum retention period 
we will apply sfas no 
to exit or disposal activities initiated after december   as requi red 
in november  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  it must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the accounting provisions of fin are effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements for periods ending after december  we adopted the disclosure requirements of fin in  as discussed in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we will apply the accounting requirements of fin to any guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not believe that this accounting standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends existing accounting literature to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the statement also requires additional disclosures in both interim and annual financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the accounting provisions if elected and the disclosure provisions required of sfas no 
were effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have currently elected not to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin applies in the first interim or annual period beginning after june  to variable interest entities existing or acquired before february  it also applies to all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  in the third quarter of  we will be required to adopt the provisions of fin under the current structure of our first and second facilities  we will be required to consolidate these facilities upon the adoption of fin if consolidated  our property  plant and equipmen t and current and long term debt will increase on our consolidated balance sheet 
we do not expect that fin will require us to consolidate our receivables facility 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the eitf reached a final consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
eitf no 
clarifies certain aspects for accounting and recording by customers of consideration received from suppliers 
under eitf no 
 consideration received related to growth rebates and agreements containing specified time period restrictions should be recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold and recognized on a systematic and rational allocation if the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
in addition  consideration received for certain promotional activities should be recorded as a reduction of those costs  with any excess being recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
we believe the application of eitf no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
quarterly results and seasonality set forth below is certain summary information with respect to our operations for the most recent eight fiscal quarters 
all of the fiscal quarters set forth below had weeks 
historically  the restaurant and foodservice business is seasonal  with lower sales in the first quarter 
consequently  we may experience lower net sales during the first quarter  depending on the timing of any future acquisitions 
management believes our quarterly net sales will continue to be impacted by the seasonality of the restaurant business 
in addition  our fresh cut segment experiences some seasonality  primarily due to changes in raw material costs  as product is grown in different regions of the country in certain times of the year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks are related to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
our primary interest rate risk is from changing interest rates related to our outstanding debt 
we currently manage this risk through a combination of fixed and floating rates on these obligations 
as of december   our total debt consisted of fixed and floating rate debt of million and million  respectively 
in addition  the rates on our receivables facility and two master operating lease facilities are floating rates 
substantially all of our floating rates are based on libor with the exception of the rate on the receivables facility  which is based upon a day commercial paper rate 
a basis point increase in market interest rates on all of our floating rate debt  our receivables facility and our two master operating lease facilities would result in a decrease in net earnings and cash flow of approximately million per annum  holding other v ariables constant
