overview we were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the state of maryland on may  our investment objectives are to achieve a high level of current income by investing in debt securities  consisting primarily of senior notes  senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes  of established private businesses that are backed by leveraged buyout funds  venture capital funds or others  with a particular emphasis on senior subordinated notes 
in addition  we may acquire existing loans that meet this profile from leveraged buyout funds  venture capital funds and others 
we also seek to provide our stockholders with long term capital growth through the appreciation in the value of warrants or other equity instruments that we may receive when we make loans 
we operate as a closed end  non diversified management investment company  and have elected to be treated as a business development company under the act 
we seek out small and medium sized businesses that meet certain criteria  including the potential for growth in cash flow  adequate assets for loan collateral  experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the borrower  profitable operations based on the borrower s cash flow  reasonable capitalization of the borrower usually by leveraged buyout funds or venture capital funds and the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position  if any 
we anticipate that liquidity in our equity position will be achieved through a merger or acquisition of the borrower  a public offering by the borrower or by exercise of our right to require the borrower to buy back its warrants 
we lend to borrowers that need funds to finance growth  restructure their balance sheets or effect a change of control 
our loans typically range from million to million  mature in no more than seven years and accrue interest at a fixed or variable rate that exceeds the prime rate 
a number of our loans have a provision that calls for some portion of the interest payments to be deferred and added to the principal balance so that the interest is paid  together with the principal  at maturity 
this form of deferred interest is often called paid in kind or pik interest  and  when earned  we record pik interest as interest income and add the pik interest to the principal balance of the loans 
because our loans will generally be subordinated debt of private companies who typically cannot or will not expend the resources to have their debt securities rated by a credit rating agency  we expect that most  if not all  of the debt securities we acquire will be unrated 
we cannot accurately predict what ratings these loans might receive if they were in fact rated  and therefore we cannot determine whether or not they could be considered to be investment grade quality 
to the extent possible  our loans generally are collateralized by a security interest in the borrower s assets 
interest payments are generally made monthly or quarterly except to the extent of any pik interest with amortization of principal generally being deferred for several years 
the principal amount of the loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at maturity at five to seven years 
when we receive a warrant to purchase stock in a borrower in connection with a loan  the warrant will typically have an exercise price equal to the fair value of the portfolio company s common stock at the time of the loan and entitle us to purchase a modest percentage of the borrower s stock 
in addition  as a business development company under the act  we are required to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies 
we provide these services  for which we receive fees  through our wholly owned subsidiary  gladstone advisers  inc such fees are typically paid in part at the time a prospective portfolio company signs a non binding term sheet with us  with the remainder paid at the closing of the investments 
these fees are generally non recurring  however in some instances they may have a recurring component 
the specific services we provide vary by portfolio company  but generally consist of reviewing existing credit facilities  arranging bank financing  arranging equity financing  structuring financing from multiple lenders  structuring financing from equity investors  restructuring existing loans  raising equity and debt capital and providing general financial advice 
we record these fees as managerial assistance fee revenue in the period in which the fees are earned 
our business plan calls for managerial assistance fee revenue to equal or exceed our operating expenses excluding interest expense 
during the fiscal years ended september  and  we recorded managerial assistance fee revenue of million and million  respectively 
however  during the fiscal years ended september  and  operating expenses excluding interest expense exceeded managerial assistance fee revenue by approximately and million  respectively 
because we typically generate managerial assistance fee revenue only when we make new loans  our relatively slow pace of loans during the and fiscal years led to this shortfall 
in the future  we will need to make loans at a faster pace in order to meet this objective 
however  we believe that  as the economic environment improves  we will be able to make sufficient new investments so that over time our managerial assistance fee revenue will equal or exceed our operating expenses excluding interest expense  although there can be no guarantee that we will be able to do so 
prior to making an investment  we ordinarily enter into a non binding term sheet with the potential borrower 
these non binding term sheets are generally subject to a number of conditions  including but not limited to the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigations of the potential borrower s business and reaching agreement on the legal documentation for the loan 
typically  upon execution of the non binding term sheet  the potential borrower pays us a non refundable fee for our services rendered through the date of the non binding term sheet 
we recognize this as management fee revenue upon execution of the non binding term sheet 
in the event that we expend significant effort in considering and negotiating a potential investment that ultimately is not consummated  we generally will seek reimbursement from the proposed borrower for our reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proposed transaction 
any amounts collected are recognized as other income in the quarter in which such reimbursement is received 
also  in the event that we have incurred significant legal fees in connection with the transaction  we will typically also seek reimbursement for these expenses from the proposed borrower 
however  there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in collecting any such reimbursements 
the only significant continuing revenue associated with the investments we have already closed is interest income and  potentially  capital gains realized in connection with the liquidation of any associated equity interest eg  warrants 
while in some instances we may also receive on going managerial assistance fee revenue in connection with a consummated investment  any such amounts are insignificant 
the general economic climate during both fiscal years ended september  and was unfavorable 
many businesses saw their sales and business prospects decline during the year 
consequently  many of these companies were forced to lay off employees and engage in other cost cutting measures 
as a result of the difficult business climate  we determined it prudent to proceed cautiously in making loans during each of these fiscal years 
since our initial public offering in august  we have made eighteen different loans to  or investments in  twelve companies for a total of approximately million including the maximum aggregate amount outstanding under an million line of credit in favor of one of our portfolio companies  that has subsequently been retired 
in spite of the economic environment  we are earnestly working toward the consummation of more investments 
these prospective loans are subject to  among other things  the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigation of each borrower  acceptance of terms and structure and necessary consents 
with respect to each prospective loan  we will only agree to provide the loan if  among other things  the results of our due diligence investigations are satisfactory  the terms and conditions of the loan are acceptable and all necessary consents are received 
our management has initiated its due diligence investigations of the potential borrowers  however we can not assure you that we will not discover facts in the course of completing our due diligence that would render a particular investment imprudent or that any of these loans will actually be made 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we have identified our investment valuation process as our most critical accounting policy 
investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
we value our investment portfolio each quarter 
members of our portfolio management team prepare the portfolio company valuations using the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts 
these individuals also consult with the respective principal who originated the portfolio investment to obtain further updates on the portfolio company s performance  including information such as industry trends  new product development  and other operational issues 
as of march   we engaged standard poor s loan evaluation service s p to help evaluate the value of the majority of our loan securities 
since june   our s p engagement includes evaluations on exit fees conditional interest included in some loan securities 
we and s p only evaluate the value of an exit fee if the probability of receiving the exit fee on a given loan is above  a threshold of significance  in which case a value is assigned 
upon completing the data collection  the valuation data is presented to s p 
s p makes its independent assessment of the data and assesses its own data to determine market values for the securities 
with regard to its work  s p has issued the following paragraph s p provides evaluated price opinions which are reflective of what s p believes the bid side of the market would be for each loan after careful review and analysis of descriptive  market and credit information 
each price reflects s p s best judgment based upon careful examination of a variety of market factors 
because of fluctuation in the market and in other factors beyond its control  s p cannot guarantee these evaluations 
the evaluations reflect the market prices  or estimate thereof  on the date specified 
the prices are based on comparable market prices for similar securities 
market information has been obtained from reputable secondary market sources 
although these sources are considered reliable  s p cannot guarantee their accuracy 
with our assessment and s p value estimates as a backdrop  our board votes to accept or not accept the analyses and values recommended by management and s p 
at september   the board elected to accept the valuations recommended by s p on those loans as denoted on the schedule of investments in the consolidated financial statements 
because there is a lag between when we close a loan and when the loan can be evaluated by s p  new loans are not valued immediately by s p  rather  the board makes its own determination about the value of the loan in accordance with our valuation policy 
because s p does not provide values for mortgage loans or equity securities  the directors also determine fair value of these using the valuation policy general valuation policy we carry our investments at fair value  as determined by our board of directors 
securities that are publicly traded  if any  are valued at the closing price on the valuation date 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or for which we have various degrees of trading restrictions  are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
in making the good faith determination of the securities  we start with the cost basis of the security  which includes the amortized original issue discount  exit fee defined interest and pik interest  if any 
we then apply the methods set out below in valuation methods 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been obtained had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
no single standard for determining fair value in good faith exists since fair value depends upon circumstances of each individual case 
in general  fair value is the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security 
credit information we monitor a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance 
we require our portfolio companies to provide annual audited and monthly  unaudited financial statements 
using these statements  we calculate and evaluate the credit statistics 
for purposes of analyzing the financial performance of our portfolio companies  we may make certain adjustments to their cash flow statements to reflect the pro forma results of a company consistent with a change of control transaction  to reflect anticipated cost savings resulting from a merger or restructuring  costs related to new product development  compensation to previous owners  and other acquisition or restructuring related items 
loan grading and risk rating as of december  we expanded the scale of our loan grading system from one that had a scale of to  to a scale that uses to this system is used to estimate the probability of default on our debt securities and the probability of loss if there is a default 
these types of systems are referred to as risk rating systems and are used by banks and rating agencies 
we risk rate each of our debt securities 
the risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities we hold 
we seek to have our risk rating system mirror the risk rating systems of major risk rating organizations such as those provided by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsro as defined in rule a under the act 
while we seek to mirror the nrsro systems  we cannot provide any assurance that our risk rating system provides the same risk rating as a nrsro 
the following chart is an estimate of the relationship of our risk rating system to the designations used by two nrsros as they risk rate debt securities of major companies 
because we have established our system to rate debt securities of companies that are unrated by any nrsro there can be no assurance that the correlation to the nrsro set out below is accurate 
it is our understanding that most debt securities of middle market companies do not exceed the grade of bbb on a nrsro scale  so there would be no debt securities in the middle market that would meet the definition of aaa  aa or a 
therefore  our scale begins with the designation bbb as the best risk rating 
company s system first nrsro second nrsro gladstone capital s description a baa bbb probability of default pd during the next ten years is and the expected loss el is or less baa bbb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa cc pd is and the el is to n a d pd is or there is a payment default and the el is greater than a the default rates set here are for a ten year term debt  if the company s debt security is less than ten years then the probability of default is adjusted to a lower percentage for the shorter period which may move the security higher on the company s risk rating scale 
at september   all debt investments were grade under the to loan grading system 
the rating of on the system means that the portfolio companies were performing as agreed and they had paid on time 
using the expanded scale  at december   march   june   and september  the average  weighted average and highest rated loan and lowest rated loan were as follows rating december  march  june  september  average weighted average highest lowest the above scale gives an indication of the probability of default and the magnitude of the loss if there is a default using the expanded risk rating scale 
our policy is to stop accruing interest on an investment if we determine that interest is no longer collectible 
to date we have not placed any investments on non accrual 
at september  and september   no payments were past due on any of our debt securities 
we do not risk rate our equity securities 
valuation methods for debt securities  we first determine if there is a market for the debt security 
if there is a market  then we will determine the value based on the market prices for the security  even if that market is not robust 
at september  and september  there was no market for any of the debt securities in our portfolio 
if there is no market for the debt securities  then we begin with the risk rating designation of the security described above 
using the risk rating designation above  we seek to determine the value of the security as if we intended to sell the security in a current sale 
to determine the current sale price of the security  we may use some or all of the following items financial standing of the issuer of the security  comparison of the business and financial plan of the issuer with actual results  the cost of the security  the size of the security held as it relates to the liquidity of the market for such securities  contractual restrictions on the disposition of the security  pending public offering of the issuer of the security  pending reorganization activity affecting the issuer such as mergers or debt restructuring  reported prices of similar securities of the issuer or comparable issuers  ability of the issuer to obtain needed financing  changes in the economy affecting the issuer  recent purchases or sale of a security of the issuer  pricing by other buyers or sellers of similar securities  financial statements of the borrower  the type of security  cost at date of purchase  size of holding  discount from market value of unrestricted securities of the same class at the time of purchase  special reports prepared by analysts  information as to any transactions or offers with respect to the security  existence of merger proposals or tender offers affecting the securities  the collateral  the issuer s ability to make payments  the current and forecasted earnings of the issuer  sales to third parties of similar securities  statistical ratios compared to lending standards  statistical ratios compared to other similar securities and other pertinent factors 
for equity securities  we first determine if there is any market for the equity security 
if there is a market  then we determine the value based on the market prices for the security  even if that market is not robust 
at september  and september  there was no market for any of the equity securities we owned 
if there is no market for the equity securities  then we use the same information we would use for a debt security valuation described above  except risk rating  as well as standard valuation techniques used by major valuation firms to value the equity securities of private companies 
these valuation techniques consist of discounted cash flow of the expected sales price in the future  the value of the securities based on the recent sale of comparable transactions and a review of similar companies that are publicly traded and the market multiple of their equity securities 
at september  we had  invested  at cost  in equity securities compared to our debt portfolio with a cost basis of  at september   the home care supply  inc senior loan has an appreciation of  in its value as a result of the value applied to the exit fee 
further  the value of our warrants in finn corporation has an appreciation of  at september  this appreciation plus an increase of  on the kozy shack enterprises investment totals  and partially offsets depreciation of  our new risk rating system is more detailed than our prior system 
due to the more detailed nature of the risk rating system there is the likelihood that future valuations will change more frequently 
s p determines what a loan might trade at if it was publicly traded  which also adds volatility to our valuations 
managerial assistance fees the act requires that a business development company make available managerial assistance to its portfolio companies 
we provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies in connection with our investments through our wholly owned subsidiary  gladstone advisers  inc and receive fees for our managerial assistance services 
these fees are normally paid at the closing of our investments in our portfolio companies  are generally non recurring and are recognized as revenue when earned 
the managerial assistance services we provide vary by investment  but generally consist of reviewing existing credit facilities  arranging bank financing  arranging equity financing  structuring financing from multiple lenders  structuring financing from equity investors  restructuring existing loans  raising equity and debt capital  and providing general financial advice 
from time to time  we are invited to participate as a co lender in a transaction 
in the event that we do not provide significant managerial assistance services in connection with our investment  loan fees paid to us in such situations are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan 
results of operations comparison of the fiscal years ended september  and september  operating income operating income for the fiscal year ended september  was million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  this increase is primarily a result of increased interest income from an increase in the amount of investments 
these debt securities provide a higher yield than the short term investment grade securities 
interest income from our investments in debt securities of private companies was approximately million  including  of pik interest  for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   including  of pik interest 
this increase was primarily the result of approximately million of new investments for the fiscal year ended september  the weighted average yield on our portfolio for the fiscal year ended september  was without giving effect to pik interest and after giving effect to pik interest 
the weighted average yield on our portfolio for the fiscal year ended september  was without giving effect to pik interest and after giving effect to pik interest 
the yields were computed based on the cost value of the investment portfolios 
interest income from invested cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately  as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  this decrease was primarily a result of million of new investments 
for the fiscal year ended september   we recorded approximately  in interest income from loans to our employees in connection with the exercise of employee stock options  as compared to approximately  in interest income from such loans for the fiscal year ended september  during the year ended september   one loan was repaid in full and a new loan was entered into as a result of an employee stock option exercise 
managerial assistance fees were approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  and million for the fiscal year ended september  fee income for each of the fiscal years ended september consists primarily of managerial assistance fees received in connection with investments we closed during the respective fiscal year 
during the fiscal year ended september   we closed five new loans compared to eight from the prior fiscal year 
other income was approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  and  for the fiscal year ended september  for the fiscal year ended september   this amount was comprised of  in waiver fees for certain loan covenants   in early principal payment penalty fees   in up front fees for a proposed investment and  in other income 
for the fiscal year ended september   this amount was comprised of approximately  in up front fees received in connection with five proposed investments that ultimately were not consummated and approximately  in other fees 
operating expenses operating expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately million  compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  this increase was primarily a result of the increase in personnel  new office space acquired in september  increased operations and financing fees incurred in connection with the credit line facility we established in fiscal year salaries and benefits for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  the primary reason for the increase was the hiring additional employees during the year 
we expect salaries and benefits to continue to increase as we hire additional personnel as operations expand 
rent expense for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  this increase is due to the new office space acquired in september professional fees  consisting primarily of legal and audit fees  for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  as compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  this decrease is the result of a decline in legal fees during fiscal year directors fees for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  as compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  the increase is due to the increase in the annual directors fees as well as the increase in the number of meetings during the year and the addition of new board members 
general insurance expense for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  the majority of this increase is due to an increase in directors and officers insurance premiums as insurance carriers have increased their premiums in the wake of the increase in high profile corporate fraud and mismanagement as well as the sarbanes oxley act 
stockholder related costs for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  these costs include printing charges related to annual reports and proxy solicitations as well as other stockholder required communications such as the electronic filings of sec reports 
financing fees for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  this is the first year in which these charges were incurred 
these fees represent the related service fees associated with the our line of credit  backup service and the amortization of deferred financing costs 
general and administrative expenses  consisting primarily of office operations  travel and data communications  for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  as compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  these increases were largely related to new employees and the expansion of operations 
net increase in stockholders equity from operations we had a net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations of approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  based on a weighted average of  basic and  diluted shares outstanding  our net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations per common share for the fiscal year ended september  was basic and diluted 
for the fiscal year ended september   we realized a net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations of approximately million 
based on a weighted average of  basic and  diluted shares outstanding  our net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations per common share for the fiscal year ended september  was basic and diluted 
comparison of the fiscal year ended september  to the period from inception may  through september  operating income operating income for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately million as compared to  for the period from inception may  through september  this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of operations in the results for the fiscal year as contrasted to our limited operations during the prior period 
in addition  during the fiscal year  we began investing the proceeds of our initial public offering in debt securities of private companies 
these debt securities provide a higher yield than the short term investment grade securities that represented substantially all of our assets as of september  interest income from our investments in debt securities of private companies was approximately million for the fiscal year ended september   including  of pik interest 
because we did not make any such investments prior to november  we did not record interest income from debt securities of private companies for the period from inception through september  the weighted average yield on our portfolio for the fiscal year ended september  was without giving effect to pik interest and after giving effect to pik interest 
interest income from invested cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately million  as compared to approximately  for the period from inception through september  this increase was primarily a result of our investment of the net proceeds of our initial public offering for the full year 
by comparison  the results for the period from inception through september  include interest income earned on the investment of the net proceeds of our initial public offering from august  the date of the closing of our initial public offering through september  as we continue to acquire debt securities of private companies  which we anticipate will be at interest rates significantly greater than the rates that we are currently receiving on our deposited cash and cash equivalents  we expect that income from invested cash and cash equivalents will decline as a percentage of total revenue and that interest income from debt securities will increase and become our predominant source of revenue 
for the fiscal year ended september   we recorded approximately  in interest income from loans to our employees in connection with the exercise of employee stock options  as compared to approximately  in interest income from such loans for the period from inception through september  the increase is primarily the result of the inclusion in the results of operations for the year ended september  of a full year of interest income on the majority of such employee loans which were made at the time of our initial public offering and  to a lesser extent  the inclusion of interest income on employee loans entered into during the fiscal year 
by comparison  the results for the period from inception through september  include interest earned on such employee loans from the time of exercise of such options august  through september  managerial assistance fees were approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  fee income for the fiscal year ended september  consists primarily of managerial assistance fees received in connection with investments we closed during the fiscal year 
it also includes approximately  in fees associated with a line of credit we extended to one of our portfolio companies that is no longer outstanding 
because we did not make any investments in debt securities of private companies prior to november  we did not record any managerial assistance fee income for the period from inception through september  other income was approximately  for the fiscal year ended september  this amount was comprised of approximately  in up front fees received in connection with five proposed investments that ultimately were not consummated and approximately  in other fees 
because we did not experience the termination of any such negotiations during the period from inception through september   we did not record any other income for such period 
operating expenses operating expenses for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately million  compared to approximately  for the period from inception through september  this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of operations in the results for the fiscal year  as contrasted to our limited operations during the period from inception through september  however  this increase was partially offset by substantial nonrecurring costs associated with our organization and our commencement of operations incurred during the period from inception through september  salaries and benefits for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately million  as compared to approximately  for the period from inception through september  this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of operations in the results for the fiscal year  as contrasted to our limited operations during the period from inception through september  salaries and benefits also increased as a result of our hiring additional employees during the year 
general and administrative expenses  consisting primarily of insurance  office operations  travel and stockholder related expenses  for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  as compared to approximately  during the period from inception through september  this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of operations in the results for the fiscal year  as contrasted to our limited operations during the period from inception through september  general and administrative expense also increased as a result of the general expansion of our operations during the year 
professional fees  consisting primarily of legal and audit fees  for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  as compared to approximately  during the period from inception through september  this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of operations in the results for the fiscal year  as contrasted to our limited operations during the period from inception through september  rent expense for the fiscal year ended september  was approximately  as compared to approximately  during the period from inception through september  this increase was primarily a result of the inclusion of a full year of operations in the results for the fiscal year  as contrasted to our limited operations during the period from inception through september  this amount also increased as a result of our relocation of our principal executive offices following the completion of our initial public offering 
directors fees for the fiscal year ended september  were approximately  as compared to approximately  during the period from inception through september  we anticipate that annual directors fees will approximate  per non employee director over time 
net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations as a result of the operating income and operating expenses described above  we had net increase to stockholders equity resulting from operations of approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  based on a weighted average of  basic and  diluted shares outstanding  our net increase in stockholders equity resulting from operations per common share for the fiscal year ended september  was basic and diluted 
for the period from inception through september   we incurred a net decrease in stockholders equity resulting from operations of approximately  based on a weighted average of  shares outstanding  our net decrease to stockholders equity resulting from operations per common share for the period from inception through september  was  basic and diluted 
liquidity and capital resources at september   we had investments in debt securities of  or loans to  eleven private companies totaling approximately million  including approximately  in accrued pik interest 
at september   we had investments in debt securities of  or loans to  seven private companies  totaling approximately million of total investment assets  including approximately  in accrued pik interest 
pik interest is described in overview  and is added to our carrying value of our investments 
the following table summarizes the contractual principal amortization and maturity of our investment portfolio by fiscal year year amount thereafter total cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended september   consisting primarily of the items described in results of operations  was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million as compared to net cash used in investing activities of approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  the net cash provided was due largely in part to million provided in connection with the repurchase agreements and the repayments of the repurchase agreements  and principal repayments of million  partially offset by million of invested cash 
at september   the net cash used consisted of investments in our portfolio companies  partially offset by a net increase in cash of approximately million in connection with repurchase agreements and the repayment  by our portfolio companies  of principal of approximately million 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  and consisted of the payment of dividends of million and the payment of prepaid financing fees associated with the establishment of our warehouse line of credit of million 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  and consisted primarily of the payment of dividends of approximately million and the repayment of accrued costs of approximately  associated with our initial public offering 
during the fiscal year ended september   cash and cash equivalents increased from approximately million at the beginning of the year to approximately million at the end of the year 
this increase was largely the result of the repurchase agreement described below 
during the fiscal year ended september   cash and cash equivalents decreased from approximately million at the beginning of the year to approximately million at the end of the year 
this decrease of approximately million was largely the result of our investing activities  partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents in connection with the repurchase agreement described below 
on september   we entered into a repurchase agreement the repurchase agreement with ubs for  which agreement was settled on october  the repurchase agreement was recorded at cost and was fully collateralized by a united states treasury bill with a fair value of  and a carrying value of  that matured on october  the interest rate on the repurchase agreement was 
the repurchase agreement was reflected on the consolidated balance sheet at september  as cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors of million and a liability of million 
in the future  we plan to use a similar form of repurchase agreement as an investment option or in order to satisfy certain asset diversification requirements and maintain our status as a ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code 
on september   we entered into a repurchase agreement with ubs paine webber for approximately million 
the repurchase agreement was fully collateralized by a united states treasury bill with a fair value of approximately million that matured on october  the interest rate on the repurchase agreement was 
this repurchase agreement was reflected on our balance sheet as of september  as an increase in cash and cash equivalents pledged to creditors of million  along with a corresponding liability for the same amount 
the repurchase agreement was settled on october  in order to qualify as a regulated investment company and to avoid corporate level tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders  we are required  under subchapter m of the internal revenue code  to distribute at least of our ordinary income and short term capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis 
in accordance with these requirements  we declared and paid quarterly cash dividends of   and per share on our common stock for the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively  of the fiscal year ended september  and   and per share on our common stock for the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively  of the fiscal year ended september  aggregate dividends declared and paid for the fiscal year were approximately million 
this resulted in our net investment income exceeding the dividends related to our fiscal year by million 
aggregate dividends declared and paid for the fiscal year were approximately million 
we declared these dividends based upon our estimate of net operating income for the year 
because of the difficult economic climate during the fiscal year  our investment pace was slower than we had originally anticipated  and consequently  our net operating income was lower than we had originally projected 
this resulted in our dividends related to our fiscal year exceeding our net operating income for the year by approximately million 
additionally  dividends related to our fiscal year exceeded our current and accumulated earnings and profits and  as a result  a portion of these dividends were treated as a return of capital to our stockholders 
in november  kozy shack enterprises inc  repaid its entire outstanding loan balance 
we anticipate borrowing funds and issuing additional equity securities to obtain additional capital once the proceeds of our initial public offering have been fully invested 
to this end  we have filed with the sec a registration statement that would permit us to issue  through one or more transactions  up to an aggregate of million in securities  consisting of common stock  preferred stock and or debt securities 
on march   the sec declared the registration statement effective  and we currently have no immediate plans to issue any securities under the registration statement 
revolving credit facility through our wholly owned subsidiary  business loan  we have obtained a million revolving credit facility 
on may   we executed a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell certain loans to business loan in consideration of a membership interest therein 
simultaneously  business loan executed a credit agreement with cibc world markets inc  as administrative agent  and others  pursuant to which business loan pledged the loans purchased from us to secure future advances by certain institutional lenders 
interest rates charged on the advances under the facility will be based on libor  the prime rate or the federal funds rate  depending on market conditions  and will adjust periodically 
the facility contains covenants that  among other things  require business loan to maintain its status as a separate entity  prohibit certain significant corporate transactions such as mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions  and restrict material changes to our credit and collection policies 
the facility also restricts some of the terms and provisions including interest rates  terms to maturity and payments schedules and limits the borrower and industry concentrations of loans that are eligible to secure advances 
as of november   business loan was in compliance with all of the facility covenants 
we currently intend to securitize all of the loans held by business loan and will use the proceeds from the securitization to pay down any amounts then outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
there are currently no advances outstanding under this facility 
gladstone advisers  inc advisers  our servicing subsidiary  will service the loans pledged under the facility 
as a condition to this servicing arrangement  we executed a performance guaranty pursuant to which we guaranteed that advisers would comply fully with all of its obligations under the facility 
the performance guaranty requires us to maintain a minimum net worth of million and to maintain asset coverage with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness of at least  in accordance with section of the act 
as of november   we were in compliance with our covenants under the performance guaranty 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
we expect that ultimately approximately of the loans in our portfolio will be made at fixed rates  with approximately made at variable rates 
currently our portfolio has approximately of the loans at fixed rates and the remaining at variable rates with a minimum rate provision 
currently these variable loans record income based on the minimum rate provision 
pursuant to our line of credit  we have agreed to enter into hedging transactions  such as interest rate swaps  in connection with the borrowings that we make under the line of credit  which we currently expect to begin making in the near future 
such transactions will effectively convert our fixed rate portfolio loans into variable rate loans in an effort to mitigate our exposure to increases in interest rates on our borrowings on the line of credit  which will be at variable rates 
furthermore  in the event that we securitize a portion of our loan portfolio in the future  we believe that we will likely be required to enter into similar arrangements with respect to securitized loans 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse fluctuations in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments
