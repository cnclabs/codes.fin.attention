item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included below in item and factors that may affect future results included above in item of this annual report on form k 
overview was a year of transition at the company 
we i experienced a significant decline in revenue versus the prior year  ii sold rbm in september to a newly formed company headed by the then chairman  chief executive officer and co founder of the company  iii effected a significant reduction in force and other cost cutting measures to more properly align our cost structure and needs with the company s current business and iv engaged a strategic consulting firm  with extensive experience in the life sciences industry  to assist management in evaluating and refining the core focus and operating plans for the company 
all of these were major events  and we believe the actions taken during will allow us to focus the company s efforts and maximize our market potential and business strategy to be the industry standard for performing bioassays 
the operating results for as compared with reflect a reduction in total revenue  a decline in gross profit and an increase in total operating expenses  inclusive of a million restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter of as a result  management has taken significant measures to improve operating results 
in  we reduced overhead costs through the reductions in force  which lowered total employment from at march  to at march  management believes these and other cost reductions were prudent and necessary to stabilize the business and position the company for future growth 
we also hired a strategic consulting firm during the fourth quarter of to work with management to evaluate  refine and focus the company s strategic plan and operations 
in addition  the management evaluation and search committee  with the assistance of a nationally known management recruiting firm  continues to evaluate candidates for the company s chief executive officer position 
the rbm sale in september involved the divestiture of a research and development project in which luminex xmap technology was used to analyze a large number of proteins  metabolites and other substances in the blood 
the transaction was an asset and liability transfer to a newly formed company headed by dr 
mark chandler  the company s then chairman  chief executive officer and co founder 
we received both a preferred stock equity interest  containing a million liquidation preference  and a nondilutable prior to a public offering common stock interest in the newly formed company rules based medicine  inc 
we also entered into a development and supply agreement in which rules based medicine  inc licensed our xmap technology 
at the time of the acquisition  we recorded an investment carrying value of million in rules based medicine  inc  which represented the historical basis of the cash and equipment transferred to the acquirer in the transaction 
upon evaluation at year end  we recorded an impairment write down of the full carrying value of the equity investment received in the asset sale of million based on current estimates of future cash flow  current market conditions and current profitability of rules based medicine  inc the business restructuring charges of million for were comprised of i approximately million in personnel related costs associated with the reductions in force and ii approximately  associated with the early termination of a real estate lease for expansion space no longer needed for our operations 
in connection with the lease termination  we reduced our leased space in austin  texas from  to  square feet 
for the years ended december   and  we had net losses of million  million and million  respectively 
we anticipate that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of current and new products  the timing of the introduction by our strategic partners of commercial products based on our technology  a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle for our product offerings  our ability to scale up manufacturing operations and avoid component shortages  the timing of regulatory approvals  the timing of significant orders and any modifications of the company s operating plan in response to the ongoing evaluation of the company s business and search for a new chief executive officer 
our limited operating history makes accurate predictions of future operations difficult 
our ability to achieve sustained profitability will depend upon our ability to continue to enter into strategic partnerships with companies that will develop and market products incorporating our technology and market and distribute our systems and consumables 
strategic partners will develop application specific bioassay kits for use on our systems that they will sell to their customers generating royalties for us 
strategic partners may also perform testing services for third parties using our technology that will also result in royalties for us 
some strategic partners will also buy our products and then resell those products to their customers 
through december   we have strategic partners who have released commercialized products based on the luminex platform and are submitting royalties 
these strategic partners constituted of total revenues for we believe actions taken in the third and fourth quarter of to right size our infrastructure and reduce the cash burn rate will better allow management to further develop our technology  more effectively deliver our products and serve our customers needs 
during  we anticipate  among other things i hiring a new chief executive officer  ii refining our strategic and operating focus and iii improving our customer and strategic partner relationships  all while maintaining controls on our costs and operating expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue on sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
generally  these criteria are met at the time our product is shipped 
we expect that each system s sale will generate a recurring revenue stream from the sale of consumable products 
we recognized royalty revenues for the first time from some of our strategic partners during royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells products incorporating our technology or provides testing services to third parties using our technology 
royalty revenue is recognized as it is reported to us by our partners  and payment is typically submitted concurrently with the report and is included in product revenue 
we also sell to our customers extended service contracts for maintenance and support of our products 
one customer accounted for and  respectively  of total revenue in and in  another customer accounted for of total revenue 
no other customer accounted for more than of our revenues in  and in  three customers together accounted for of total revenue 
we believe these customer relationships continue to be good  however  the loss of a significant customer  a significant reduction in product purchases or financial difficulty for a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe these customers will continue as significant customers in total deferred revenue as of december  was million and consisted of i payments received for sales to customers with rights of return that had not yet expired  ii upfront payments from strategic partners to be used for the purchase of products or to be applied towards future royalty payments  iii unamortized revenue related to extended service contracts and iv unamortized license fees 
upfront payments from our strategic partners are nonrefundable and will be recognized as revenue as our strategic partners purchase products or apply such amounts against royalty payments 
nonrefundable license fees are amortized into revenue over the estimated life of the license agreements 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
at december   there were two major components of the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
first  the company has a specific reserve for inventory components that we no longer use in the manufacture of our systems 
second  we have a reserve against slow moving items for potential obsolescence 
the total estimated allowance is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
the company believes that its inventory is properly valued based on current market conditions 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses historically have been within our expectations  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of credit losses that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our significant customers  or a further deterioration in the economic environment  in general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts

liquidity and capital resources at december   we held cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and had working capital of million  as compared with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and working capital of million at december  we have funded our operations to date primarily through the issuance of equity securities 
our cash reserves are held directly or indirectly in a variety of short term  interest bearing instruments  including obligations of the united states government or agencies thereof and us corporate debt securities 
cash used in operations was million in  compared with million in the reduction in net cash used in operations  in conjunction with a million net loss in  primarily reflects a decrease in accounts receivable of million  an increase of deferred revenue of million  a net inventory reduction of million  an increase in accrued liabilities of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million and million for the impairment of asset charge on the carrying value of our strategic investment in rules based medicine  inc purchases of property and equipment in totaled million compared with million in we have non cancellable purchase commitments with certain of our component suppliers 
should our production requirements fall below the level of our commitments  we could be required to take delivery of inventory for which we have no immediate need or incur an increased cost per unit going forward 
we are not otherwise committed to scheduled purchase requirements 
however  because of a long lead time to delivery  we are required to place orders for a variety of items well in advance of scheduled production runs 
should the company s need for raw materials and components used in production continue to fluctuate  we could incur additional costs associated with either expediting or postponing delivery of those materials 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in thousands thereafter total non cancellable rental obligations 
  non cancellable purchase obligations   anticipated liquidity impact as of december     our research and development expenses in were million  of which the rbm project was approximately million 
in  we currently expect research and development expenses related to the ongoing development of our xmap technology and consumables to be approximately to million 
selling  general and administrative expenses should decrease during as a result of the restructuring efforts taken in the fourth quarter of we currently expect total selling  general and administrative expenses to be in the range of to million for in the first quarter of  we settled the pending lawsuit and entered into a full  final and complete release with our prior patent counsel  without an admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of the defendants 
as consideration for the settlement and release  the company received approximately million  net of legal and related costs and expenses 
this cash infusion will offset losses anticipated from operations during the first quarter of additionally  we currently expect to receive approximately million in nonrefundable license fees from strategic partners during these license fees are amortized into income over the life of the agreement 
our future cash requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our success in developing and expanding markets for our products  payments under possible future strategic arrangements  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the need to acquire licenses to new technology and the status of competitive products 
additionally  any actions taken based on recommendations of the consulting firm hired in november to evaluate and refine the focus and operating plans for the company could result in expenditures not currently contemplated in our estimates for we believe  however  that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are sufficient to fund our current operating expenses and capital equipment requirements for we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that debt or equity funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  incurring debt financing could result in a substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  could render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns and could impose restrictions on our operations 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into agreements on unattractive terms 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments held to maturity 
a basis point fluctuation from average investment returns at december  yields an approximate variance in overall investment return 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
all payments for our products  including sales to foreign customers  are required to be made in us dollars  therefore  we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities 
accordingly  our foreign currency market risk is limited
