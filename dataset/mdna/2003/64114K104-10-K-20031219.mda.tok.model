critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our processes used to develop estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  investments and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  expectations of future results  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of broadband internet equipment at the time of shipment to a third party customer when a the customer takes title of the goods  b the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  c the customer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  d the customer s obligation to us would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  and e we do not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the customer 
at the date of shipment  assuming that the revenue recognition criteria specified above are met  we provide for an estimate of returns and warranty expense based on historical experience of returns of similar products and warranty costs incurred  respectively 
we recognize software revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we generally have multiple element arrangements for our software revenue including software licenses and maintenance 
we allocate the arrangement fee to each of the elements based on the residual method utilizing vendor specific objective evidence vsoe for the undelivered elements  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
vsoe for maintenance is generally based on the price the customer would pay when sold separately 
software license revenue is recognized when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed or a properly authorized firm purchase order is received and the customer acknowledges an unconditional obligation to pay  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
maintenance revenues  including revenues included in multiple element arrangements  are deferred and recognized ratably over the related contract period  generally twelve months 
we recognize revenue from long term software development contracts using the percentage of completion method in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue is recognized based on our achievement  and the customer s acceptance  of certain milestones agreed upon by both parties with consideration given to the number of hours expended as compared to hours budgeted 
on a quarterly basis  we review costs incurred to date along with an estimate to complete and compare the sum of such amounts against the revenue expected from the arrangement to determine the need for an accrual for loss contracts 
we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
our enhanced web site services generally involve the delivery of multiple services 
we allocate a portion of the arrangement fee to the undelivered element  generally web site hosting  based on the residual method utilizing vsoe for the undelivered elements  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
vsoe for hosting is based on the price the customer would pay when sold separately 
fair value for the delivered elements  primarily fulfillment services  is based on the residual amount of the total arrangement fees after deducting the vsoe for the undelivered elements 
fulfillment revenue is recognized when a properly authorized firm purchase order is received and the customer acknowledges an unconditional obligation to pay  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  collection is considered probable and the fulfillment has been completed 
hosting revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the related service period  generally twelve months 
we record unearned revenue for these arrangements when cash has been received from the customer and the arrangement does not qualify for revenue recognition under our revenue recognition policy 
we record unearned revenue for software and service arrangements when cash has been received from the customer and the arrangement does not qualify for revenue recognition under our revenue recognition policy 
we record accounts receivable for software and service arrangements when the arrangement qualifies for revenue recognition and cash or other consideration has not been received from the customer 
goodwill 
on october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that goodwill should not be amortized but instead be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level 
the impairment testing is performed in two steps i the determination of impairment  based upon the fair value of a reporting unit as compared to its carrying value  and ii if there is an indication of impairment  this step measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
we perform our annual impairment test  as required by sfas no 
 in our fiscal fourth quarter 
we performed such test during the fiscal fourth quarter ended september   the result of which indicated the fair value of the reporting unit was greater than the carrying value of the unit and therefore no impairment was identified 
as of september   we had approximately million of goodwill related to our acquisitions of weborder and netoctopus  which is allocated to our web platform licenses and services reporting unit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets  including other intangible assets 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  on october  sfas no 
serves to clarify and further define the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
and test our long lived assets and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
if an asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets and is allocated to the long lived assets of the asset group on a pro rata basis 
fair value is estimated using the discounted cash flow method 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying values or fair values  less costs of disposal 
at september   our other intangible assets consisted of developed product technology  core technology and sales channel relationships related to the acquisition of cayman as well as a certain marketing license 
we did not test our long lived assets and other intangible assets for impairment during the fiscal year ended september   because there were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of the asset groups might not be recoverable 
as of september   we had million of other intangible assets related to our acquisition of cayman and million related to a marketing license 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we maintain stock option plans under which we may grant incentive stock options and non statutory stock options 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  encourages  but does not require  companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans based on the fair market value of options granted 
we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
because the grant price equals the market price on the date of grant for all options we issue  we do not recognize compensation expense for stock options granted to employees 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognize as an expense  the fair value of options and other equity instruments granted to non employees 
we have not issued any stock options to non employees since fiscal year  excluding options issued to our directors 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
sfas no 
requires more prominent and frequent disclosures about the effects of stock based compensation 
we will continue to account for our stock based compensation according to the provisions of apb no 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes the aging of accounts receivable and also analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
if the financial condition of our customers or channel partners were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
long term investments 
we periodically make strategic investments in companies whose stock is not currently traded on a stock exchange and for which no quoted price exists 
the cost method of accounting is used to account for these investments  as we do not exert significant influence over these investments 
we review these investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate to management that an impairment exists may be a significant decrease in the market value of the company  poor or deteriorating market conditions in the public and private equity capital markets  significant adverse changes in legal factors or within the business climate the company operates  and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or projections and forecasts that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the company s future business plans 
impairment indicators identified during the reporting period could result in a significant write down in the carrying value of the investment if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
as of september   these investments had a total carrying value of million  and have been permanently written down a total of million from original cost 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in significant additional impairment charges in the future 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we assess the need for reserves on excess and obsolete inventory based upon monthly forward projections of sales of products 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
cost includes material costs and applicable manufacturing overheads 
the provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based upon management s analysis of inventory levels  forecasted sales  expected product life cycles and market conditions 
once inventory is reserved  the reserve can only be relieved by the subsequent sale or scrapping of the inventory 
provision for income taxes 
we did not record an income tax benefit for the fiscal years  and primarily due to continued substantial uncertainty regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
based upon available objective evidence  there has been sufficient uncertainty regarding the ability to realize our deferred tax assets to warrant a full valuation allowance in our financial statements 
the factors considered included prior losses  inconsistent profits  and lack of carry back potential to realize our deferred tax assets 
based on our estimates for fiscal year and beyond  we believe the uncertainty regarding the ability to realize our deferred tax assets may diminish to the point where it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
at such point  we would reverse all or a portion of our valuation allowance which will result in an income tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheets  cash flows and commitments on our liquidity and capital resources 
as of september   our principal source of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents in the amount of million  a credit facility with a maximum borrowing capacity of up to million from which  at september   we had no outstanding borrowings  and two term loans from which we had amounts outstanding of million 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the following table sets forth our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of the fiscal years ended september   and increase decrease from prior year fiscal years ended september  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for the fiscal year ended september   cash and cash equivalents decreased primarily due to cash used by our operating activities  the payoff of borrowings under our credit facility and purchases of capital equipment 
excluding the changes in operating assets and liabilities  we used million to support our net loss 
changes in operating assets and liabilities used million primarily due to an increase in our accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in our accounts payable 
we paid off the borrowings under our credit facility which totaled million  we purchased million of capital equipment and we purchased a marketing license for million 
this use of cash was partially offset by a cash received from our sale of approximately million shares of common stock in a private placement in august which raised million  and b cash received from our sale of common stock to employees under our employee stock purchase plan and employee stock option exercises  which provided million 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash and cash equivalents decreased primarily due to the use of cash to acquire cayman  cash used by our operating activities  and purchases of capital equipment 
we used approximately million of cash in connection with our acquisitions of cayman and dobox  our operating activities  excluding the changes in operating assets and liabilities  used million primarily as a result of a decline in our revenues and associated gross profit  and we purchased million of capital equipment  primarily computer equipment used for a new website hosting location and equipment used in the research and development process 
this use of cash was partially offset by cash provided from borrowings under our credit facility  which at september   totaled million 
changes in operating assets and liabilities provided million  primarily related to the decrease of inventory and increase of accounts payable and other liabilities  and million primarily received from our sale of common stock to employees under our employee stock purchase plan 
at september   we had no borrowings under our credit facility and approximately million borrowed under our term loans 
we expect to continue to use our credit facility along with our existing cash and cash equivalents to support our working capital needs in both the short and long term 
additionally  we expect our cash and cash equivalents at december  may be similar to the balances at september   although these balances are impacted to the extent that we need to purchase additional inventory to build our products or otherwise support our continuing operations 
as of september   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
we will keep our credit facility to finance our future growth and fund our ongoing research and development activities as needed during fiscal and beyond 
we believe we have adequate cash  cash equivalents and borrowing capacity to meet our anticipated capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
if we issue additional stock to raise capital  our existing stockholders percentage ownership in netopia would be reduced 
trade accounts receivable  net 
the following table sets forth our trade accounts receivables  net as of the fiscal years ended september   and increase decrease from prior year fiscal years ended september  in thousands trade accounts receivable  net days sales outstanding dso days days days changes in our trade accounts receivable  net balances and days sales outstanding are primarily due to the timing of sales  increased revenues and collections performance 
our targeted range for dso is to days 
trade accounts receivable and dso increased primarily due to a large proportion of sales occurring in the last month of the three month period ending september  as well as payment terms that have been provided to certain of our european customers that are generally up to days longer than our customary payment terms 
inventory 
the following table sets forth our inventory  net as of the fiscal years ended september   and increase decrease from prior year fiscal years ended september  in thousands inventory inventory turns inventory consists primarily of raw material  work in process  and finished goods 
inventory has decreased and inventory turns have improved as a result of increasing visibility into customer demand enabling us to more effectively manage inventory levels as well as our manufacturing providers now purchasing directly from suppliers certain raw material we historically purchased and consigned to our manufacturers which value was carried in our inventory 
inventory levels may increase in the future if our customers do not provide us with accurate information  if we do not correctly forecast expected customer demand  or if customers defer or otherwise delay purchases 
we may have to borrow against our credit facility to finance any needed inventory increases 
we continue to closely monitor our management of inventory as we balance the need to maintain adequate inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
borrowings under credit facility and term loans 
the following table sets forth the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and term loans as of the fiscal years ended september  and increase decrease from prior year fiscal years ended september  in thousands borrowings under credit facility  n a n a borrowings under term loans n a n a at september   we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and had a borrowing availability of approximately million 
at september   borrowings under the credit facility were used to support our operating activities and purchases of inventory 
we used the term loans during fiscal year to purchase capital equipment to enhance the capabilities of our test laboratory 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe the amended terms of the credit facility provide adequate access to borrowings to meet our current capital needs 
commitments as of september   we had commitments that consisted of facilities and equipment under operating lease agreements and borrowings under term loans 
these commitments and obligations are reflected in our financial statements once goods or services have been received or payments related to the obligations become due

internet equipment 
broadband internet equipment revenues increased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to increased sales volumes of our adsl broadband internet equipment to ilec customers  both in the united states and europe  who serve the market for business and residential class adsl internet services 
sales volumes increased primarily as a result of sales to swisscom and earthlink  neither of which were customers in fiscal year  and increased purchases by sbc  as we continue to penetrate the adsl market with both residential and business class products  and increased purchases by covad 
these increases were partially offset by reduced sales to ingram micro and bellsouth as well as declining average selling prices primarily as a result of the mix of products sold  price competition from foreign and domestic competitors and customer driven demands 
the mix of broadband internet equipment sales is changing as we begin entering the residential adsl market 
historically  residential class products  and adsl products generally  have carried a lower average selling price than similar business class products 
we expect that we will continue to experience declining average selling prices  primarily as a result of the changing mix of products we sell and price competition from both foreign and domestic suppliers 
we believe that increased sales volumes to current and new customers will help offset these declines 
see the product volume and average selling price information section below  which sets forth our volumes and average selling prices 
web platform licenses and services 
web platforms revenues decreased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to reduced license sales of timbuktu  our system management software  and our esite and estore products which declined to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year this decline was partially offset by revenues related to a software integration project with one specific customer  which increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year recurring revenue  primarily related to our esite and estore products  increased slightly to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year revenues compared to revenues total revenues for fiscal year decreased from fiscal year primarily due to decreased revenues from the sale of our broadband internet equipment products 
internet equipment 
broadband internet equipment revenues decreased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to reduced sales to the clec market and reduced average selling prices partially offset by increased sales volumes 
sales to the clec market  as illustrated in the customer information section below  declined as a result of the operational and financial difficulties encountered by customers such as covad  rhythms netconnections  inc rhythms and northpoint communications  inc 
northpoint 
rhythms and northpoint subsequently ceased operations 
average selling prices declined primarily as a result of the mix of products sold  price competition from foreign and domestic competitors and customer driven demands 
sales volumes increased primarily as a result of the customers we acquired in connection with our acquisition of cayman and new customers in europe 
for example  we shipped approximately  internet routers  or approximately million of revenue in fiscal year  to customers acquired in connection with our acquisition of cayman  primarily sbc and bellsouth  to which we previously had not sold our broadband internet equipment 
see the product volumes and average selling price information section below  which sets forth our volumes and average selling prices 
web platform licenses and services 
web platforms revenues increased slightly for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to increased recurring revenue  primarily related to hosting of our esite and estore products  which increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year as well as revenues related to a software integration project with one specific customer  which totaled million for fiscal year these increases were almost equally offset by reduced license sales of our esite  estore and timbuktu products 
licensing of our esite  estore and timbuktu products decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year primarily as a result of fewer licensing opportunities available to the dot com type customers to whom we licensed our esite and estore products 
we licensed our esite and estore products to dot com type customers largely in fiscal years and since that time  we have focused our efforts on supporting other licensees that continue to market esites and estores using our software  for which we receive on going recurring revenues 
we have introduced a number of new software products using the underlying technology in the esite and estore products  including the ecare and netoctopus desktop support software products  and we intend to license these new products to large corporate accounts 
product volumes and average selling price information the following tables sets forth for the periods indicated  volumes and average selling prices  excluding accessories  of our broadband internet equipment products 
the decline in average selling prices resulted from increased sales of lower price residential class products as compared to higher price business class products  as well as competitive market conditions generally 
we expect that average selling prices will continue to decline for the same reasons  although at a lesser rate

revenues from the united states increased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to increased sales volumes of our adsl broadband equipment to sbc as well as increased sales of our business class broadband equipment to covad 
international revenues increased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to increased sales of our adsl broadband equipment into the european residential market through our new european customers partially offset by decreased sales of our isdn routers as a result of the growing demand for dsl internet services as well as decreased sales of our web platforms products 
revenues from the united states decreased for fiscal from primarily due to declining sales to the clec market and declining average selling prices partially offset by increased sales to customers we acquired in connection with our acquisition of cayman 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of material costs of our internet equipment products and related manufacturing variances 
total cost of revenues increased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily as a result of increased sales volumes of our adsl broadband internet equipment and costs related to our software integration project 
these increases were partially offset by reduced material costs for our broadband internet equipment as a result of reduced component costs  product redesigns intended to reduce cost  and the introduction of new products that have a lower average cost 
in the past  we have been successful reducing the product and component costs of our internet equipment products 
we expect cost of revenues to increase slightly as a proportion of revenue in as excess component inventories that we purchase from our suppliers are depleted and prices for such components increase as a result of improved general economic conditions and customer demand 
to help offset any cost increase  we intend to leverage our increasing volumes with our contract manufacturers and continue to pursue product redesigns and alternative  lower cost components for our products in an effort to reduce our products material costs 
although our sales volumes increased for fiscal year from fiscal year  total cost of revenues decreased primarily due to reduced material costs for our broadband internet equipment as a result of product redesigns and the introduction of new adsl products that have a lower average cost than our other broadband internet equipment  the increased use of contract manufacturing operations in asia where our products can be manufactured less expensively than in the united states and reduced component costs 
gross margin our total gross margin decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to increased sales of lower margin adsl broadband internet equipment and a lower percentage of higher margin web platforms revenue in the total revenue mix 
internet equipment 
broadband internet equipment gross margin decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to increased sales of lower margin adsl products  declining average selling prices as a result of product mix and price competition as well as pricing strategies as we enter new markets and expand our customer base 
this decrease was partially offset by reduced product costs as discussed in the above cost of revenue discussion 
the primary factors influencing our internet equipment gross margin are product mix  our ability to drive down material and product costs based on negotiations with our vendors and increased volumes  and the timing of these cost reductions relative to market pricing conditions 
web platform licenses and services 
web platforms gross margin decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to engineering labor costs  reclassed from research and development expense  associated with the software integration project for one specific customer 
excluding the effects of this project  web platforms gross margin was for fiscal year our internet equipment products have a lower average gross margin than our web platforms products 
accordingly  to the extent we sell more internet equipment than web platforms products  our gross margins would be lower 
in the past  our gross margin has varied significantly and will likely vary significantly in the future 
our gross margins depend primarily on the mix of internet equipment and web platforms products sold  pricing strategies  increased sales of our residential class broadband internet equipment which historically have had a lower average selling price than our business class broadband internet equipment  product and material cost changes  new versions of existing products  and external market factors  including but not limited to  price competition 
our total gross margin increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to the increased proportion of revenues from our higher margin web platforms products partially offset by the decline of average selling prices of our broadband internet equipment 
internet equipment 
broadband internet equipment gross margin decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to reduced average selling prices as a result of price competition and pricing strategies as we enter new markets  introduce new products and expand our customer base  increased sales of lower margin adsl products  reduced sales of dedicated router products which carry a higher gross margin than our dsl products  as well than slower than planned product transitions to lower cost  higher margin products 
this decrease was partially offset by reduced product costs as discussed in the above cost of revenue discussion 
web platform licenses and services 
web platforms gross margin increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to our ability to reduce our costs related to supporting and provisioning our esite and estore products 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  depreciation and amortization  development related expenses such as product prototyping  design and testing  and overhead allocations 
research and development expenses decreased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to the reallocation of employee costs associated with our software integration project from research and development expenses to web platform cost of revenues as well as decreased research and development staff and employee related expenses 
for fiscal year  we transferred million of employee costs  which represents approximately full time equivalent employees during such period  from research and development expenses to web platform cost of revenues 
for fiscal year  our average research and development staff decreased by approximately employees from fiscal year  resulting in approximately million in reduced employee related expenses 
research and development expenses increased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to an increase of research and development staff by approximately employees and increased employee related expenses of approximately million primarily as a result of our acquisitions of cayman in october and dobox in march and increased facility and depreciation expenses of approximately million as a result of the acquisitions of cayman and dobox and their leased facilities and development assets 
these increases were partially offset by reduced product prototyping and design expenses 
additionally  the use of third party contractors was reduced for fiscal year from fiscal year we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to product and technological development 
we expect research and development costs may increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our product offerings 
we believe our process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility 
during fiscal year we capitalized million and during fiscal year  we capitalized million of development costs incurred subsequent to delivery of a working model  under development agreements with third parties 
research and development project cancellation costs for fiscal year  research and development project cancellation costs totaled million and consist primarily of material and equipment costs associated with our joint development efforts with siemens and proxim to develop a wireless iad for sale to at t for at t s anticipated roll out of voice over dsl services 
as a result of at t not accepting the final product developed by siemens and canceling its plans to deploy these services  there was no longer a customer or market into which we could sell the product under development 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and commission expense for our sales force  travel and entertainment  advertising and promotional expenses  product marketing  customer service and support costs 
selling and marketing expenses decreased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to decreased selling and marketing staff and employee related expenses as well as decreased travel and entertainment expenses and as a result of our restructurings and expense control efforts and reduced facility and depreciation expenses 
for fiscal year  our average selling and marketing staff decreased by approximately employees from fiscal year  resulting in approximately million in reduced employee related and travel and entertainment expenses 
additionally  facility and depreciation expenses decreased million 
selling and marketing expenses decreased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to the reduction of sales and marketing staff by approximately people and the corresponding decrease of employee related expenses of approximately million as well as decreased travel and entertainment expenses of approximately million as a result of our restructuring in october and decreased marketing programs and activities of approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by increased depreciation and equipment maintenance expense related to capital purchases for equipment used in our technical support and service functions 
we expect selling and marketing expenses may increase in fiscal year as result of increased headcount  employee related expenses and marketing programs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  provisions for doubtful accounts and legal  accounting and insurance costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to million of reduced provisions for doubtful accounts for outstanding accounts receivable owed by customers that filed voluntary petitions under the bankruptcy act in  decreased headcount and employee related expenses as a result of our restructurings and expense control efforts as well as reduced use of third party contractors 
for fiscal year  our average general and administrative headcount decreased by approximately employees from fiscal year  resulting in approximately million in reduced employee related expenses and million as a result of a reduction in the use of contractors 
these reductions were partially offset by million of increased costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters from alameda  california to emeryville  california as well as million of increased insurance costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased for fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to reduced incremental provisions for doubtful accounts for outstanding accounts receivable owed by customers that filed voluntary petitions under the bankruptcy act and many of which ceased operations 
included in general and administrative expense for fiscal year is million of incremental provisions for doubtful accounts 
for fiscal year  general and administrative expense includes million of incremental provisions for doubtful accounts of which million was related to the outstanding accounts receivable of northpoint 
during december  in a private transaction whereby we sold our claim in the northpoint bankruptcy proceedings  we recovered approximately million of the million northpoint receivable for which we had recorded a provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal year we expect general and administrative expenses will remain approximately at current levels for fiscal year amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal years and  these amounts represent the amortization of intangible assets with identifiable lives related to our acquisition of cayman 
for fiscal year  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets represents the amortization of both goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions of weborder  starnet  serus and netoctopus 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect amortization of other intangible assets will increase in future periods as a result of the amortization of other intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of jadesail in october our first fiscal quarter of 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring costs for fiscal year  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million 
this net charge consisted primarily of million of employee severance benefits related to reductions in our workforce during fiscal year and facility closure costs related to the closure of a sales office in hong kong as well as a reversal of million of liabilities we had accrued in connection with our restructurings during fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for fiscal year  restructuring costs consist primarily of employee severance benefits recorded in connection with a reduction in our workforce of approximately employees whose positions were determined to be redundant subsequent to the closing of the cayman acquisition 
for fiscal year  restructuring costs consist primarily of employee severance benefits and the costs to exit certain of our business activities and closure of a facility 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development represents research and development assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions of cayman and dobox in fiscal year that were not technologically feasible at the time of acquisition and had no alternative future use  and as such were expensed at the time of the transaction 
we allocated approximately million of the purchase price of cayman and approximately million  or  of the purchase price of dobox to acquired in process research and development 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal year  this amount represents the full impairment of the remaining goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisitions of cayman and starnet 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we completed our annual goodwill impairment test on august  for the internet equipment and web platform reporting units 
at august   the implied fair value of our internet equipment reporting unit was found to be less than its carrying amount and as a result  we recorded a charge to our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the fiscal year ended september  of million 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for fiscal year  this amount represents the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions of weborder  starnet and serus 
as provided under sfas no 
 given the slower than anticipated growth in the market for our iad products derived from the technology acquired from starnet and the rapid and sharp decline in the dot com market to which we marketed and licensed certain of our web platforms products including technology which we acquired from weborder and serus in addition to the slower than anticipated revenue growth in the market for such products  we determined the net carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets related to these acquisitions will not be fully recovered 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of million based on the difference of the carrying value and the estimated discounted future operating cash flows of the goodwill and other intangible assets related to these acquisitions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
integration costs integration costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of cayman and integrating cayman s customers  systems and operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
terminated merger costs this amount represents the costs incurred in connection with the terminated merger between our company and proxim 
the charge consists primarily of expenses for accounting and legal advisory services  initiation of joint marketing and research and development programs in anticipation of the merger that we had undertaken at the direction of proxim  certain shared merger costs  and other related costs 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income loss  net other income loss  net consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents  interest expense  realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions as well as losses on impaired securities that we deem other than temporary 
loss on impaired securities 
for fiscal year  loss on impaired securities represents a million loss on impaired securities  fully impairing the remaining investment in everdream 
for fiscal year  this amount represents a million and a million charge for impaired securities related to our investments in megapath and everdream  respectively 
these impairment charges were recorded in connection with the valuation of megapath and everdream based upon their most recent rounds of financing in such year 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for fiscal year  loss on impaired securities represents the entire loss of our investment in northpoint 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net primarily represents interest expense with respect to borrowings under our credit facility  interest income as well as losses on foreign currency transactions 
other income  net decreased for fiscal years  and primarily due to decreased interest income as our cash and cash equivalents have declined combined with reductions in interest rates 
cumulative effect from adoption of sab this amount represents the charge we recorded upon adoption of sab see note  revenue recognition  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others

risk factors the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this form k  and the risks discussed in our other filings with the united states securities and exchange commission  our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
we have a history of losses and negative cash flow 
we may incur losses and negative cash flow in the future  which could significantly harm our business 
as a result of continuing capital expenditure requirements and operating expenses in all areas of our business  our failure to increase our revenues or sufficiently reduce our operating expenses will result in continuing losses and negative cash flow 
we have incurred losses from continuing operations of million  million and million for fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
we used million  million and million of cash during fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million at september  even if we reach profitability and maintain positive cash flow  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability or cash flow on a quarterly or annual basis 
we may find it difficult to raise needed capital in the future  which could delay or prevent introduction of new products or services  require us to reduce our business operations or otherwise significantly harm our business 
we must continue to enhance and expand our product and service offerings in order to maintain our competitive position and to increase our market share 
as a result  and due to our net losses and use of cash  the continuing operations of our business may require capital infusions 
whether or when we can achieve cash flow levels sufficient to support our operations cannot be accurately predicted 
unless such cash flow levels are achieved  we may require additional borrowings or the sale of debt or equity securities  sale of non strategic assets  or some combination thereof  to provide funding for our operations 
we believe we have adequate cash  cash equivalents and borrowing capacity to meet our anticipated capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  if we are unable to obtain additional funds to finance our operations when needed  our financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected and we would not be able to operate our business 
substantial sales of our broadband internet equipment will not occur unless telecommunications carriers continue substantial deployment of dsl services  and this could reduce our revenues and significantly harm our business 
the success of our broadband internet equipment depends upon the extent to which telecommunications carriers deploy dsl and other broadband technologies 
factors that have impacted such deployment include a prolonged approval process by service providers  including laboratory tests  technical trials  marketing trials  initial commercial deployment and full commercial deployment  the development of improved business models for dsl and other broadband services  including the capability to market  sell  install and maintain dsl and other broadband services  cost constraints  such as installation costs and space and power requirements at the telecommunications service provider s central office  lack of compatibility of dsl equipment that is supplied by different manufacturers  evolving industry standards for dsl and other broadband technologies  and government regulation 
we offer to carriers and service provider customers the opportunity to bundle basic dsl connectivity with value added features that enable the provider to bundle differentiated features and services that we believe can justify higher recurring revenues from end users 
these features and services include dial backup  vpns  remote management and configuration  and hosting of esites and estores 
we can offer no assurance that our strategy of enabling bundled service offerings will be widely accepted 
if telecommunications carriers do not continue to expand their deployment of dsl and other broadband services  our revenues could decline and our business could be significantly harmed 
we expect our revenues to become increasingly dependent on our ability to sell our broadband internet equipment to ilecs  and we may incur losses if we cannot successfully market and sell our products through ilec channels 
ilecs have been aggressively marketing dsl services principally focusing on residential services 
prior to our acquisition of cayman  we had not sold meaningful quantities of our broadband internet equipment to ilecs in the united states 
as a result of our acquisition of cayman  we have expanded our customer base to include two ilec customers  sbc and bellsouth  to which we previously had not sold our broadband internet equipment 
we have committed resources that are working to expand our sales in the ilec channel both domestically and internationally 
there continue to be barriers associated with such sales including  but not limited to  lengthy product evaluation cycles  the ability to dislodge competitors whose products are currently being utilized  long term product deployment cycles and intense price pressures 
ilecs currently obtain equipment from our competitors  such as wire  siemens through its siemens subscriber networks  inc subsidiary  formerly known as efficient networks  thomson  westell and zyxel  which have proven to be strong competitors 
there is no guarantee we will be successful in expanding our presence in the ilec market 
if we fail to penetrate further the ilec market for our products and services  our business may be materially and adversely affected 
we expect our revenues to become increasingly dependent on our ability to develop broadband internet equipment for and successfully enter the residential broadband gateway market 
prior to our acquisition of cayman in october  we developed  marketed and sold internet equipment products primarily to clecs and isps serving the small business market for dsl internet connectivity 
as a result of our acquisitions of cayman in october and dobox in march and our internal development initiatives  we believe that we now have products and technology that will enable us to market and deliver competitive broadband internet equipment products and services more effectively to ilecs serving the residential market 
there are numerous risks associated with our entrance into the residential broadband gateway market such as the ability to design and develop products that meet the needs of the residential market  the ability to successfully market these products to ilecs currently serving this market  and the ability to dislodge competitors that are currently supplying residential class broadband gateways 
if we are unable to overcome these challenges  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
clec and isp customers to which we historically have sold our dsl products have experienced significant business difficulties that have negatively affected our business and operating results 
prior to our acquisition of cayman in october  our most significant customers were clecs and isps 
since the middle of calendar year  most of our clec and isp customers have experienced business difficulties and some have filed for bankruptcy or ceased operations 
the financing market for clecs and isps has been effectively closed since calendar year  resulting in significantly decreased sales to clecs and isps and write offs of outstanding accounts receivable 
the difficulties of these clec and isp customers have materially and adversely affected our operating results 
covad  which emerged from bankruptcy in december  was our second largest customer during fiscal year  and it continues to incur losses 
the loss of  or decline in  purchases by one or more of our key customers would result in a significant decline in our revenues and harm to our business 
we rely on a small number of customers for a large portion of our revenues 
for the fiscal year ended september   there were four customers that each individually represented at least of our revenues and in the aggregate accounted for of our total revenues 
our revenues will decline and our business may be significantly harmed if one or more of our significant customers stop buying our products  or reduce or delay purchases of our products 
substantial portions of our revenues are derived from sales to international customers  and currency fluctuations can adversely impact our operations 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales to international customers  mainly in europe 
for the fiscal year ended september   our international sales represented of total sales 
we expect sales to international customers to continue to comprise a significant portion of our revenues 
sales of broadband internet equipment products to some of our european customers have been denominated in euros 
for our international sales that continue to be denominated in united states dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products and services to become relatively more expensive to our foreign customers  which could lead to decreased sales of our products and services 
in addition  changes in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar could adversely affect our operating results to the extent we do not adequately hedge sales denominated in euros 
additional risks associated with international operations could adversely affect our sales and operating results in europe 
our international operations are subject to a number of difficulties and special costs  including costs of customizing products for foreign countries  laws and business practices favoring local competitors  dependence on local vendors  uncertain regulation of electronic commerce  compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  longer sales cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  import and export restrictions and tariffs  difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations  multiple conflicting tax laws and regulations  and political and economic instability 
in addition  if we establish more significant operations overseas  we may incur costs that would be difficult to reduce quickly because of employee related laws and practices in those countries 
because the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and some of our competitors are larger  better established and have more cash resources  we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
we sell products and services in markets that are highly competitive 
we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and service offerings and new competitors enter the market 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
competitors vary in size  scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
in the market for broadband internet equipment  we primarily compete with wire  siemens through its siemens subscriber networks  inc subsidiary  formerly known as efficient networks  thomson  westell and zyxel 
in the market for our web platforms products  we primarily compete with altiris  computer associates  crosstec  expertcity  landesk  microsoft and symantec 
we anticipate intense competition from some of these companies because some of these competitors provide their products to consumers at no cost 
many of our current and potential competitors in all product areas have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  significantly greater name recognition and a larger base of customers than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers and have extensive knowledge of these industries 
in the past  we have lost potential customers to competitors in all product areas for various reasons  including lower prices and other incentives not matched by us 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products and services to address customer needs 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we also expect that competition will increase as a result of industry consolidation 
our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate because of many factors and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
our revenues and operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future from quarter to quarter 
for example  during the past eight quarters ending september   our revenues have ranged from million to million  and our net results have ranged from million of income to a loss of million 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
investors should not rely on the results of any one quarter or series of quarters as an indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter  quarters or year our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in such event  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 
in addition to the uncertainties and risks described elsewhere under this risk factors heading  variations in our operating results will likely be caused by factors related to the operation of our business  including variations in the timing and size of orders for our broadband internet equipment products  increased price competition for our broadband internet equipment products  our ability to license  and the timing of licenses  of our web platforms products  the mix of products and services and the gross margins associated with such products and services  including the impact of our increased sales of lower margin broadband internet equipment as a percentage of our total revenues and increased sales of lower margin adsl products within our family of broadband internet equipment  the price and availability of components for our broadband internet equipment  and the timing and size of expenses  including operating expenses and expenses of developing new products and product enhancements 
other technologies for the broadband gateway market compete with dsl services 
dsl services compete with a variety of different broadband services  including cable  satellite and other wireless technologies 
many of these technologies compete effectively with dsl services 
if any technology competing with dsl technology is more reliable  faster  less expensive  reaches more customers or has other advantages over dsl technology  then the demand for our dsl products and services and our revenues and gross margins will decrease 
there is no guarantee we will be able to develop and introduce products for these competing technologies 
we purchase the semiconductor chips for our broadband internet products from a limited number of suppliers  and the inability to obtain in a timely manner a sufficient quantity of chips would adversely affect our business 
all of our broadband internet products rely on special semiconductor chips that we purchase from fewer than five suppliers 
we do not have volume purchase contracts with any of our suppliers and they could cease selling to us at any time 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these semiconductor chips in a timely manner for any reason  sales of our broadband internet products could be delayed or halted 
further  we could also be forced to redesign our broadband internet products and qualify new suppliers of semiconductor chip sets 
the resulting stoppage or delay in selling our products and the expense of redesigning our products would adversely affect our business 
if we were unable to obtain components and manufacturing services for our broadband internet equipment from independent contractors and specialized suppliers  our business would be harmed 
we do not manufacture any of the components used in our products and perform only limited assembly on some products 
all of our broadband internet equipment relies on components that are supplied by independent contractors and specialized suppliers 
furthermore  substantially all of our broadband internet equipment includes printed circuit boards that are manufactured by fewer than five contract manufacturers that assemble and package our products 
we do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with these third parties and they could cease selling components to us at any time 
moreover  the ability of independent contractors and specialized suppliers to provide us with sufficient components for our broadband internet equipment also depends on our ability to accurately forecast our future requirements 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of components from independent contractors or specialized suppliers in a timely manner for any reason  sales of our broadband internet equipment could be delayed or halted 
similarly  if supplies of circuit boards or products from our contract manufacturers are interrupted for any reason  we will incur significant losses until we arrange for alternative sources 
in addition  we may be required to pay premiums for components purchased from other vendors should our regular independent contractors and specialized suppliers be unable to timely provide us with sufficient quantity of components 
to the extent we pay any premiums  our gross margins and operating results would be harmed 
further  we could also be forced to redesign our broadband internet equipment and qualify new suppliers of components 
the resulting stoppage or delay in selling our products and the expense of redesigning our broadband internet equipment would seriously harm our reputation and business 
failure to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner could harm our competitive position and operating results 
we compete in markets characterized by continuing technological advancement  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
to compete successfully  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products and services that provide increasingly higher levels of performance  reliability  compatibility  and cost savings for our customers 
we will need to continue to integrate our dsl modem and router technology with the architectures of leading central office equipment providers in order to enhance the reliability  ease of use and management functions of our dsl products 
we have recently developed and introduced a broadband services platform that enables network operations centers of broadband service providers the ability to remotely manage  support  and troubleshoot installed broadband gateways  thereby providing the potential for reducing support costs 
we believe this service delivery platform can assist us in differentiating our products and services from those of our competitors 
however  this platform and the underlying technology are relatively new  and we cannot provide any assurance that  when deployed in mass scale  the platform will perform as expected  there are no hidden bugs or defects  or it will be widely adopted by the customers to whom we are marketing the platform 
we may not be able to successfully develop  introduce  enhance or market these or other products and services necessary to our future success 
in addition  any delay in developing  introducing or marketing these or other products would seriously harm our business 
many of our broadband internet equipment products and services are relatively new 
you should consider our prospects in light of the difficulties we may encounter because these products are at an early stage of development in a rapidly evolving and intensely competitive market 
for example  we may not correctly anticipate market requirements  or introduce rapidly new products that meet such requirements for performance  price  features and compatibility with other dsl equipment 
failure to continue to develop and market competitive products would harm our competitive position and operating results 
our revenues will not grow and we may incur greater losses if we cannot successfully sell our web platforms products 
we derive a substantial portion of the recurring revenues from our web platforms products from a small number of large customers 
the majority of our web platforms revenues are derived from the sale of software products for corporate help desks  including timbuktu and ecare 
for the fiscal year ended september   revenues from these help desk applications were of total revenues for our web platform products 
we anticipate that the market for timbuktu will grow more slowly than the market for our other web platforms products and services 
in addition  we rely on a small number of licensees of our web platforms to promote the use of our web platforms for building web sites and stores 
as a result  we derive the majority of the recurring revenues from our web platforms products from fewer than five customers 
the extent and nature of the promotions by licensees of our web platforms are outside of our control 
if licensees of our esite and estore web platforms do not successfully promote web sites and stores to their customers  we will not generate continued recurring revenues 
if these customers were to choose a competitive platform  this could lead to reduced revenues and adversely impact our results 
if hosting services for our web platforms perform poorly  our revenue may decline and we could be sued 
we depend on our servers  networking hardware and software infrastructure  and third party service and maintenance of these items to provide reliable  high performance hosting for esite and estore customers 
in addition  our servers are located at third party facilities 
failure or poor performance by third parties with which we contract for maintenance services could also lead to interruption or deterioration of our esite and estore hosting services 
additionally  a slowdown or failure of our systems for any reason could also lead to interruption or deterioration of our esite and estore hosting services 
in such a circumstance  our hosting revenue may decline 
in addition  if our esite and estore hosting services are interrupted  perform poorly  or are unreliable  we are at risk of litigation from our customers  the outcome of which could harm our business 
we may continue to experience declining gross margins due to price competition and an increase in sales of lower margin broadband internet equipment as a percentage of our total revenue 
we expect that sales of our broadband internet equipment may account for a larger percentage of our total revenues in future periods 
because our broadband internet equipment products are sold at lower gross margins than our web platforms products and sales volumes of our lower margin adsl products are increasing  our overall gross margins will likely decrease 
further  we expect that the market for broadband internet equipment will remain highly competitive and as a result  we will be continue to lower the prices we charge for our broadband internet equipment 
if the average selling price of our broadband internet equipment declines faster than our ability to realize lower manufacturing costs  our gross margins related to such products  as well as our overall gross margins  are likely to decline 
failure to attract or retain key personnel could harm our business 
our future performance depends on the continued service of our senior management  product development and sales personnel  particularly alan lefkof  our president and chief executive officer 
none of our employees is bound by an employment agreement  and we do not carry key person life insurance 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could seriously harm our business 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry and geographic location is intense 
although we believe our personnel turnover rate is consistent with industry norms  our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract  hire  train and retain a substantial number of highly skilled managerial  technical  sales  marketing and customer support personnel 
in addition  new hires frequently require extensive training before they achieve desired levels of productivity 
our intellectual property may not be adequately protected  and our products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties  which may adversely impact our competitive position and require us to engage in costly litigation 
we depend on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely primarily on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures  trade secrets  and patent  copyright and trademark law 
we presently have one united states patent issued that relates to our timbuktu and ecare software 
the term of this patent is through august we also have filed a provisional patent application relating to the design of our wi fi dsl gateways 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and there is no guarantee that the safeguards that we employ will protect our intellectual property and other valuable competitive information 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software and internet industries regarding intellectual property rights 
although we have not been party to any such litigation  in the future third parties may claim that our current or potential future products or we infringe their intellectual property 
the evaluation and defense of any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive 
furthermore  such claims could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on financially unattractive terms  which could seriously harm our business 
if we are unable to license necessary software  firmware and hardware designs from third parties  our business could be harmed 
we rely upon certain software  firmware and hardware designs that we license from third parties  including firmware that is integrated with our internally developed firmware and used in our products 
we cannot be certain that these third party licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
the loss of  or inability to maintain  such licenses could result in product shipment delays until equivalent firmware is developed or licensed  and integrated into our products  which would seriously harm our business 
our products are complex and may contain undetected or unresolved defects 
our products are complex and may contain undetected or unresolved defects when first introduced or as new versions are released 
although we historically have not experienced material problems with product defects  if our products do contain undetected or unresolved defects  we may lose market share  experience delays in or losses of market acceptance or be required to issue a product recall 
similarly  although we have not experienced material warranty claims  if warranty claims exceed our reserves for such claims  our business would be seriously harmed 
in addition  we would be at risk of product liability litigation because of defects in our products 
although we attempt to limit our liability to end users through disclaimers of special  consequential and indirect damages and similar provisions  we cannot assure you that such limitations of liability will be legally enforceable 
substantial sales of our common stock by our large stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 
a small number of stockholders hold a large portion of our common stock 
our chairman of the board owned approximately of our common stock outstanding at september  in addition  based on information contained in filings with the united states securities and exchange commission  three institutional investors owned approximately  and  respectively  of our common stock outstanding at september  to the extent one or more of these large stockholders decides to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market over a short period of time  based on the historic trading volumes  we expect the market price of our common stock could fall 
our industry may become subject to changes in regulations  which could harm our business 
our industry and industries on which our business depends may be affected by changes in regulations 
for example  we depend on telecommunications service providers for sales of our broadband internet equipment  and companies in the telecommunications industry must comply with numerous regulations 
if our industry or industries on which we depend become subject regulatory changes that increase the cost of doing business or doing business with us  our revenues could decline and our business could be harmed 
for example  if a regulatory agency imposed restrictions on dsl service that were not also imposed on other forms of high speed internet access  our business could be harmed 
business interruptions that prevent our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could adversely affect our business 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  labor disputes by transportation providers and other events beyond our control 
in particular  our headquarters are located near earthquake fault lines in the san francisco bay area and may be susceptible to the risk of earthquakes 
if there is an earthquake in the region  our business could be seriously harmed 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
in addition  our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us fully for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us in the event we are unable to deliver products and services to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our stock price may be volatile  which may result in substantial losses for our stockholders 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the following variations in our quarterly operating results  including shortfalls in revenues or earnings from securities analysts expectations  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  changes in market valuations and volatility generally of securities of other companies in our industry  announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations  new products or enhancements  significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  and general conditions in the broadband communications industry  in particular the dsl market 
in recent years the stock market in general  and the market for shares of high technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are unrelated to our performance 
a third party may have difficulty acquiring us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders
