critical accounting policies and estimates it is the company s accounting policy to report revenues when products are shipped and expenses when costs are incurred 
the effect of material non recurring events is provided for when they become known 
the company currently only applies judgment and estimates  which may have a material effect on the eventual outcome of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  for accounts receivable  inventory  goodwill and accruals 
the following explains the basis and the procedure for each balance sheet account where judgment and estimates are applied 
accounts receivable the company sells to most of its customers on a recurring basis primarily through distributors with which the company maintains long term relationships 
as a result  bad debt experience has not been material 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined on a specific identification basis by a review of those accounts that are significantly in arrears 
there is no assurance that a distributor or a large direct sale customer with overdue accounts receivable balances will not develop financial difficulties and default on payment 
see balance sheet for allowance amounts 
inventory the company offers a wide variety of standard products and as a matter of policy does not discontinue products 
on an ongoing basis  component parts found to be obsolete through design or process changes are disposed of and charged to material cost 
the company reviews on hand balances of products and component parts against specific criteria 
products and component parts without usage or that have excess quantities on hand are evaluated 
an inventory reserve is then established for the full inventory carrying value of those products and component parts deemed to be obsolete or slow moving 
see note for inventory reserve amounts 
goodwill the company acquired its korean operations in september using the purchase method 
as a result  goodwill is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
a valuation based on the cash flow method was performed at december   and it was determined that the value of the goodwill was not impaired 
there is no assurance that the value of the acquired company will not decrease in the future due to changing business conditions 
see note for goodwill amounts 
accruals the company makes estimates related to certain employee benefits and miscellaneous accruals 
estimates for employee benefit accruals are based on information received from plan administrators in conjunction with management s assessments of estimated liabilities related to workers compensation  the k plan discretionary match  and health care benefits
