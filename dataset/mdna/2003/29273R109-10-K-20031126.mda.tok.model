item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations of heritage propane partners  lp and its subsidiaries  and should be read in conjunction with the partnership s historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this report  excluding historical information  as well as some statements by heritage in periodic press releases and some oral statements of heritage officials during presentations about the partnership  include certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of statements using words such as anticipate  believe  intend  project  plan  continue  estimate  forecast  may  will  or similar expressions help identify forward looking statements 
although heritage believes such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions and current expectations and projections about future events  no assurance can be given that every objective will be reached 
actual results may differ materially from any results projected  forecasted  estimated or expressed in forward looking statements since many of the factors that determine these results are subject to uncertainties and risks  difficult to predict  and beyond management s control 
such factors include o the general economic conditions in the united states of america as well as the general economic conditions and currencies in foreign countries  o the political and economic stability of petroleum producing nations  o the effect of weather conditions on demand for propane  o the effectiveness of risk management policies and procedures and the ability of heritage s liquids marketing counterparties to satisfy their financial commitments  o energy prices generally and specifically  and the price of propane to the consumer compared to the price of alternative and competing fuels  o the general level of petroleum product demand and the availability and price of propane supplies  o heritage s ability to obtain adequate supplies of propane for retail sale in the event of an interruption in supply or transportation and the availability of capacity to transport propane to market areas  o hazards or operating risks incidental to transporting  storing and distributing propane that may not be fully covered by insurance  o the maturity of the propane industry and competition from other propane distributors  o energy efficiencies and technological trends  o loss of key personnel  o the availability and cost of capital and heritage s ability to access certain capital sources  o changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject  including tax  environmental  transportation and employment regulations  o the costs and effects of legal and administrative proceedings  and o heritage s ability to successfully identify and consummate strategic acquisitions at purchase prices that are accretive to heritage s financial results 
general the retail propane business is a margin based business in which gross profits depend on the excess of sales price over propane supply costs 
the market price of propane is often subject to volatile changes as a result of supply or other market conditions over which heritage will have no control 
product supply contracts are typically one year agreements subject to annual renewal and generally provide for pricing in accordance with posted prices at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery or storage points 
in addition  some contracts include a pricing formula that typically is based on these market prices 
most of these agreements provide maximum and minimum seasonal purchase guidelines 
the number of contracts entered into may vary from year to year 
since rapid increases in the wholesale cost of propane may not be immediately passed on to retail customers  such increases could reduce gross profits 
heritage generally has attempted to reduce price risk by purchasing propane on a short term basis 
heritage has on occasion purchased significant volumes of propane during periods of low demand  which generally occur during the summer months  at the then current market price  for storage both at its customer service locations and in major storage facilities for future resale 
the retail propane business of heritage consists principally of transporting propane purchased in the contract and spot markets  primarily from major fuel suppliers  to its customer service locations and then to tanks located on the customers premises  as well as to portable propane cylinders 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating  and cooking 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for crop drying  tobacco curing  poultry brooding  and weed control 
in addition  propane is used for certain industrial applications  including use as an engine fuel for internal combustion engines that power vehicles and forklifts and as a heating source in manufacturing and mining processes 
heritage s propane distribution business is largely seasonal and dependent upon weather conditions in its service areas 
propane sales to residential and commercial customers are affected by winter heating season requirements 
historically  approximately two thirds of heritage s retail propane volume and in excess of of heritage s ebitda  as adjusted  is attributable to sales during the six month peak heating season of october through march 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues  and  in some cases  net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september of each year 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in the first and second fiscal quarters  while cash flow from operations is generally greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the six month peak heating season 
sales to industrial and agricultural customers are much less weather sensitive 
a substantial portion of heritage s propane is used in the heating sensitive residential and commercial markets resulting in the temperatures realized in heritage s areas of operations  particularly during the six month peak heating season  having a significant effect on its financial performance 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane use  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater propane use 
heritage uses information based on normal temperatures in understanding how temperatures that are colder or warmer than normal affect historical results of operations and in preparing forecasts of future operations 
gross profit margins are not only affected by weather patterns  but also vary according to customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers generate higher margins than sales to certain other customer groups  such as commercial or agricultural customers 
wholesale margins are substantially lower than retail margins 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographical region 
accordingly  a change in customer or geographic mix can affect gross profit without necessarily affecting total revenues 
on november   heritage publicly announced that it had entered into agreements to acquire energy transfer company  a company engaged in the midstream natural gas business 
upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by such agreements  heritage will operate the midstream business of energy transfer company in conjunction with its retail propane operations 
the following is a discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations of heritage propane partners  lp and its subsidiaries  and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial and operating data and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
analysis of historical results of operations heritage propane partners  lp amounts discussed below reflect of the results of mp energy partnership

cost of products sold 
total cost of sales decreased million to million as compared to million for fiscal year retail fuel cost of sales decreased million to million for fiscal year  due to decreases in the cost of propane as compared to fiscal year although the market price for propane for the year ended august  was well below the price for the year ended august   the average cost per gallon sold for fiscal year was negatively impacted by the higher cost of pre bought inventory that was absorbed into cost of sales throughout the year ended august  u

liquidity and capital resources the ability of heritage to satisfy its obligations will depend on its future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business  and weather conditions  and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
future capital requirements of heritage are expected to be provided by cash flows from operating activities 
to the extent future capital requirements exceed cash flows from operating activities a working capital will be financed by the working capital line of credit and repaid from subsequent seasonal reductions in inventory and accounts receivable  b growth capital expenditures  mainly for customer tanks  will be financed by the revolving acquisition line of credit  and c acquisition capital expenditures will be financed by the revolving acquisition line of credit  other lines of credit  long term debt  the issuance of additional common units or a combination thereof

at august   there was million available for borrowing on the working capital facility and million available on the acquisition facility 
see note working capital facility and long term debt to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report 
upon consummation of the transactions announced on november   heritage expects to maintain separate sources of financing for potential acquisitions or other expansion of energy transfer company s midstream operations  including a separate revolving credit facility 
consummation of the transaction is conditioned upon heritage s obtaining sufficient financing to complete the transactions 
heritage may acquire financing to fund its acquisition of la grange through a combination of equity and debt financing 
the debt financings may take the form of bank debt  a private debt placement with institutional investors  a public debt offering  or a combination of one or more of the foregoing

available cash generally means  with respect to any quarter of the partnership  all cash on hand at the end of such quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner in its reasonable discretion that is necessary or appropriate to provide for future cash requirements 
the partnership s commitment to its unitholders is to distribute the increase in its cash flow while maintaining prudent reserves for the partnership s operations 
the distribution was per unit annually for each of the quarters ended february  through and including may  heritage raised the quarterly distribution per unit for the quarter ended august   to per unit annually 
the current distribution level includes incentive distributions payable to the general partner to the extent the quarterly distribution exceeds per unit annually 
the assets utilized in the propane business do not typically require lengthy manufacturing process time or complicated  high technology components 
accordingly  the partnership does not have any significant financial commitments for capital expenditures 
in addition  the partnership has not experienced any significant increases attributable to inflation in the cost of these assets or in its operations 
description of indebtedness in connection with its initial public offering  on june   heritage entered into a note purchase agreement whereby heritage issued million principal amount of senior secured notes the notes with institutional investors

during the fiscal year ended august   heritage used million and million of the proceeds from the issuance of  of common units to retire a portion of the series g and series h senior secured promissory notes  respectively 
at august   million of principal debt was outstanding under the senior secured promissory notes 
the note agreements for each of the senior secured notes  medium term note program and senior secured promissory notes  and the bank credit facility contain customary restrictive covenants applicable to the operating partnership  including limitations on the level of additional indebtedness  creation of liens  and sale of assets 
these covenants require the operating partnership to maintain ratios of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as these terms are similarly defined in the bank credit facility and the note agreements of not more than to for the bank credit facility and not more than to for the note agreements and consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense as these terms are similarly defined in the bank credit facility and the note agreements of not less than to the consolidated ebitda used to determine these ratios is calculated in accordance with these debt agreements 
for purposes of calculating the ratios under the bank credit facility and the note agreements  consolidated ebitda is based upon heritage s ebitda  as adjusted  during the most recent four quarterly periods and modified to give pro forma effect for acquisitions and divestures made during the test period  and is compared to consolidated funded indebtedness as of the test date and the consolidated interest expense for the most recent twelve months 
the debt agreements also provide that the operating partnership may declare  make  or incur a liability to make  a restricted payment during each fiscal quarter  if a the amount of such restricted payment  together with all other restricted payments during such quarter  do not exceed available cash with respect to the immediately preceding quarter  and b no default or event of default exists before such restricted payment and after giving effect thereto 
the debt agreements further provide that available cash is required to reflect a reserve equal to of the interest to be paid on the notes 
in addition  in the third  second and first quarters preceding a quarter in which a scheduled principal payment is to be made on the notes  available cash is required to reflect a reserve equal to   and  respectively  of the principal amount to be repaid on such payment dates 
failure to comply with the various restrictive and affirmative covenants of the operating partnership s bank credit facility and the note agreements could negatively impact the operating partnership s ability to incur additional debt and heritage s ability to pay distributions

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
heritage evaluates its policies and estimates on a regular basis 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the partnership s significant accounting policies are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies and balance sheet detail to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report 
heritage believes the following are critical accounting policies marketable securities 
heritage has marketable securities that are classified as available for sale 
unrealized holding losses occur as a result of declines in the market value of the partnership s holdings 
the fair market value of the partnership s holdings is determined based upon the market price of the securities  which are publicly traded securities 
based on the performance of the securities over the preceding nine month period  heritage reviews the fair market value to determine if an other than temporary impairment should be recorded 
long lived assets 
heritage reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
heritage performs this review by considering if the carrying values of the assets exceed the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
if such a review should indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets is not recoverable  heritage reduces the carrying amount of such assets to fair value 
heritage has never recorded an impairment as a result of this review 
stock based compensation plans 
heritage accounts for its stock compensation plans following the fair value recognition method 
heritage adopted this accounting method on a prospective basis beginning on september  for all stock based compensation granted to date by heritage 
this method was adopted as heritage believes it is the preferable method of accounting for stock based compensation 
please see the caption stock based compensation plans in note summary of significant accounting policies and balance sheet detail to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report for additional information about this adoption and a comparison to amounts recorded in prior periods 
depreciation of property  plant  and equipment 
heritage calculates depreciation using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from to years 
changes in the estimated useful lives of the assets could have a material effect on heritage s results of operation 
heritage does not anticipate future changes in the estimated useful live of its property  plant  and equipment 
amortization of intangible assets 
heritage calculates amortization using the straight line method over periods ranging from to years 
heritage uses amortization methods and determines asset values based on management s best estimate using reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
changes in the amortization methods or asset values could have a material effect on heritage s results of operations 
heritage does not anticipate future changes in the estimated useful lives of its intangible assets 
fair value of derivative commodity contracts 
heritage enters into commodity forward  swaps  and options contracts involving propane and related products  which  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  are not accounting hedges  but are used for risk management trading purposes 
to the extent such contracts are entered into at fixed prices and thereby subject heritage to market risk  the contracts are accounted for using the fair value method 
under this valuation method  derivatives are carried in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in value recognized in earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure heritage has little cash flow exposure due to interest rate changes for long term debt obligations 
heritage had million of variable rate debt outstanding as of august  the variable rate debt consists of the bank credit facility described elsewhere in this report 
the balance in the bank credit facility generally fluctuates throughout the year 
a theoretical change of in the interest rate on the balance outstanding at august  would result in an approximate thousand change in net income 
heritage primarily incurs debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs 
heritage s long term debt instruments are typically issued at fixed interest rates 
when these debt obligations mature  heritage may refinance all or a portion of such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
commodity price risk arises from the risk of price changes in the propane inventory that heritage buys and sells 
the market price of propane is often subject to volatile changes as a result of supply or other market conditions over which heritage has no control 
in the past  price changes have generally been passed along to heritage s customers to maintain gross margins  mitigating the commodity price risk 
in order to help ensure adequate supply sources are available to heritage during periods of high demand  heritage at times will purchase significant volumes of propane during periods of low demand  which generally occur during the summer months  at the then current market price  for storage both at its customer service locations and in major storage facilities and for future resale 
propane hedging heritage also attempts to minimize the effects of market price fluctuations for its propane supply by entering into certain financial contracts 
in order to manage a portion of its propane price market risk  heritage uses contracts for the forward purchase of propane  propane fixed price supply agreements  and derivative commodity instruments such as price swap and option contracts 
the swap instruments are a contractual agreement to exchange obligations of money between the buyer and seller of the instruments as propane volumes during the pricing period are purchased 
the swaps are tied to a fixed price bid by the buyer and a floating price determination for the seller based on certain indices at the end of the relevant trading period 
heritage had entered into these swap instruments in the past to hedge the projected propane volumes to be purchased during each of the one month periods during the projected heating season 
at august   heritage had no outstanding propane hedges 
heritage continues to monitor propane prices and may enter into additional propane hedges in the future
