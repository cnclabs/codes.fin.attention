item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
certain of our accounting policies are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others 
northern border pipeline s accounting policies conform to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
accordingly  certain assets that result from the regulated ratemaking process are recorded that would not be recorded under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for nonregulated entities 
northern border pipeline continually assesses whether the future recovery of the regulatory assets is probable by considering such factors as regulatory changes and the impact of competition 
if future recovery ceases to be probable  northern border pipeline would be required to write off the regulatory assets at that time 
at december   northern border pipeline has reflected regulatory assets of million  which are being recovered from its shippers over varying periods of time 
our long lived assets are stated at original cost 
we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of those assets 
for utility property  no retirement gain or loss is included in income except in the case of retirements or sales of entire operating units 
the original cost of utility property retired is charged to accumulated depreciation and amortization  net of salvage and cost of removal 
our accounting for financial instruments follows sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which we adopted on january  sfas no 
requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement 
at december   our balance sheet included assets from derivative financial instruments of million and liabilities from derivative financial instruments of million 
our accounting for goodwill changed effective january   when we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets

update on the impact of enron s chapter filing on our business on december   enron filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
certain wholly owned enron subsidiaries also filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on december  and thereafter 
we have not filed for bankruptcy protection 
northern plains  pan border and northwest border are our general partners 
each of northern plains and pan border are wholly owned subsidiaries of enron  and northwest border is a wholly owned subsidiary of transcanada 
northern plains and pan border were not among the enron companies filing for chapter protection 
the business of enron and its subsidiaries that have filed for bankruptcy protection are currently being administered under the direction and control of the bankruptcy court 
an unsecured creditors committee has been appointed in the chapter cases 
the creditors committee is responsible for general oversight of the bankruptcy case  and has the power  among other things  to investigate the acts  conduct  assets  liabilities  and financial condition of the debtor  the operation of the debtor s business and the desirability of the continuance of such business  participate in the formulation of a plan of reorganization  and file acceptances or rejections to such a plan 
factors taken into account by enron in making its business decisions while in chapter  may include decisions with respect to its investment in northern plains and pan border  which decisions may affect us 
current effects enron s filing for bankruptcy protection has impacted us 
at the time of the filing of the bankruptcy petition  we had a number of contractual relationships with enron and its subsidiaries 
nbp services corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of enron that is not in bankruptcy  and northern plains provided and continue to provide operating and administrative services for us and our subsidiaries 
northern plains and nbp services have continued to meet their operational and administrative service obligations under the existing agreements  and we believe they will continue to do so 
ena  a wholly owned subsidiary of enron that is in bankruptcy  was a party to transportation contracts obligating ena to pay for of northern border pipeline s capacity 
through the proceeding  ena rejected and terminated all of its contracts on northern border pipeline 
northern border pipeline contracted a portion of that capacity with others for varying terms 
for  northern border pipeline experienced lost revenues of approximately million for ena s capacity 
northern border pipeline has claims against ena for damages for breach of contract and other claims 
in addition  bear paw energy has claims against ena relating to terminated hedge transactions 
in accordance with sfas no 
 bear paw energy ceased to account for these swap agreements as hedges 
bear paw energy had previously recorded approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive income related to these agreements  which is being recorded into earnings in the same periods of the originally forecasted hedges 
in  bear paw energy recorded approximately million in earnings related to the terminated hedges 
also  crestone energy ventures has claims against ena for unpaid gas gathering and administrative services fees 
we have filed claims against ena s bankruptcy estate related to these agreements 
these claims will likely be deemed to be unsecured claims against certain of the enron related chapter companies 
we are uncertain regarding the ultimate amount of damages for breach of contract or other claims that we will be able to establish in the bankruptcy proceeding  and we cannot predict the amounts that we will collect or the timing of collection 
we believe  however  that any such delay in collecting or failure to collect will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  and any amounts collected will not be material to us 
northern plains and nbp services have advised us that under the operating agreements with northern plains and the administrative services agreement with nbp services  increased costs may be incurred for health care expenses and pension benefits 
such costs are projected to increase as a result of actual medical claims experience  pension investment returns and effects of the enron bankruptcy filing 
while the determination of reimbursement of such costs by us under the appropriate agreement will be made at the time of occurrence  we estimate an increase of million over levels 
enron is the grantor of the enron gas pipeline employee benefit trust the trust  which when taken together with the enron corp 
medical plan for inactive participants the plan constitutes a voluntary employees beneficiary association or veba under section c of the internal revenue code 
in october  northern plains was advised that enron had notified the committee  that has administrative and fiduciary oversight related to the trust and the plan  that enron had made the determination to begin necessary steps to partition the assets of the trust and the related liabilities of the plan among all of the participating employers of the trust 
the trust was established as a regulatory requirement for inclusion of certain costs for post employment medical benefits in the rates established for the affected pipelines  including us 
enron requested the enrolled actuary to prepare an analysis and recommendation for the allocation of the trust s assets and associated liabilities among all the participating employers 
enron management has advised that it intends to seek bankruptcy court approval for the termination of the trust and for the participating employers to establish a separate trust adequate to receive the assets 
on may   enron presented to the creditors committee a proposal under which specified core energy assets of enron would be separated from enron s bankruptcy estate and operated prospectively as a new integrated power and pipeline company 
on august   enron announced that it had commenced a formal sales process for its interests in certain major assets  including northern plains  pan border and nbp services 
however  on march   enron announced that its board of directors had voted to move forward with the creation of a new pipeline operating entity rather than sell its interests in its north american pipelines 
this new company  temporarily referred to as pipeco  will include northern plains  pan border and nbp services 
enron s announcement also stated that enron expects pipeco to be governed by an independent board of directors and afforded protection from joint and several enron group liabilities and that upon resolution of enron s chapter bankruptcy case  it anticipates that shares of pipeco will be distributed to creditors in connection with the plan of reorganization 
enron also stated that it is evaluating the potential sale of a minority interest in pipeco 
the formation of pipeco will require various enron board  bankruptcy court and other regulatory approvals  as well as the consent of the enron s official unsecured creditors committee 
enron s filing for bankruptcy protection and related developments have had other impacts on our business and management 
arthur andersen llp resigned in early as our auditors  and we retained kpmg llp as our new auditors 
enron has received several requests for information from different agencies and committees of the united states house of representatives and senate 
some of the information requested from enron may include information about us 
in addition  we are aware that the senate committee on governmental affairs has issued a subpoena to enron requesting documents disclosing enron s communications with the sec and the ferc  as well as information on compensation matters 
as a result of enron s indirect ownership interest in us  we have been asked to comply with the mandate of the subpoena in such a manner that may be determined by the committee on governmental affairs of the senate of the united states 
possible effects while northern plains  pan border and nbp services have not filed for chapter bankruptcy protection  their stock is owned by enron  which is in bankruptcy 
as noted above  enron could sell its interest in northern plains and or pan border  or take other action with respect to their investment in northern border partners 
enron could also cause northern plains and pan border to file for bankruptcy protection 
we have had no indication from enron that it intends to cause such companies to file for bankruptcy protection 
we are managed by a three member policy committee  with one member appointed by each general partner 
the vote of each member of the policy committee is weighted by the general partner percentage of the general partner appointing such member 
the general partner percentages for northern plains  pan border and northwest border are  and  respectively 
if enron were to sell the stock of northern plains and pan border  the purchaser would have the right to appoint a majority of our policy committee  and control the activities of the partnership 
if northern plains and pan border were to file for bankruptcy relief  our partnership agreement provides that they would automatically be deemed to have withdrawn as general partners of the partnership 
it is possible that the enforceability of the automatic withdrawal provisions in this partnership agreement may be challenged 
the success and impact of a challenge are unknown 
upon the occurrence of such an event of withdrawal  the remaining general partner has the right to purchase the withdrawing partners general partnership interests 
if the remaining general partner does not purchase such general partnership interests  the limited partners have the right to elect new general partners 
in the event that the remaining general partner does not elect to purchase the general partner interests or a successor is not so elected by the limited partners  then the partnership shall be dissolved 
the partnership credit agreement provides that it will be a change of control and consequently an event of default thereunder if subsidiaries of enron and the williams companies do not control  free of any liens  greater than of general partner percentages 
the williams companies sold the stock of northwest border pipeline company to transcanada 
consequently  if enron sells the stock of northern plains and pan border or causes such companies to file for bankruptcy relief  the partnership will be in default under the partnership credit agreement 
in addition  the agreements evidencing the partnership s other material outstanding debt obligations provide that an uncured default under one material debt agreement will result in a default under other debt agreements 
northern plains also serves as operator of northern border pipeline 
if northern plains were to file for bankruptcy relief  it could potentially be removed as operator 
certain of northern border pipeline s credit agreements provide that it would be an event of default thereunder if northern plains is replaced as operator without the consent of the lenders thereunder 
the administrative services agreement between nbp services and us provides that it will terminate at such time as northern plains is no longer a general partner of the partnership 
consequently  since our partnership agreement provides that a general partner is automatically withdrawn as general partner upon filing of bankruptcy  if northern plains were to file for bankruptcy relief  the administrative services agreement would be terminated 
our partnership agreement requires that each general partner make additional capital contributions to us when we sell common units 
enron may determine that it is not in the best interest of its creditors and other constituencies in bankruptcy to make these capital contributions to northern plains and pan border 
enron could therefore decide not to allow us to pursue acquisitions financed with the issuance of additional common units 
even if enron were to permit the general partners to make a capital contribution to us  if the general partners were to subsequently file for bankruptcy relief  the capital contribution might be subject to challenge as voidable under applicable law 
other than the items set forth above  we are not are not aware of any claims made against us that arise out of the enron bankruptcy cases 
we continue to monitor developments at enron  to assess the impact on us of our existing agreements and relationships with enron and its subsidiaries  and to take appropriate action to protect our interests 
outlook we are focused on growing our businesses  our income and cash flow and our distributions to unitholders 
our strategy involves three main components 
interstate natural gas pipelines first  we will continue to focus on safe  efficient  and reliable operations and the further development of our regulated pipelines 
we intend to maintain our position as a low cost transporter of canadian gas to the midwestern us and provide highly valued services to our customers 
any growth in our interstate pipelines would occur through incremental projects intended to access new markets or supply areas and would be supported by long term contracts 
we are currently working with producers and marketers to develop the contractual support for a new mile pipeline project  the bison pipeline  to connect the coal bed methane reserves in the powder river basin to markets served by northern border pipeline 
in addition  midwestern gas transmission s recently completed joliet compression project provides the opportunity to deliver gas directly into northern border pipeline  increasing natural gas market liquidity between the pipeline systems and enhancing transportation demand for both pipelines 
furthermore  midwestern gas transmission will pursue serving additional power plants under development in southwest indiana and new delivery interconnects with other interstate pipelines to grow transportation revenues 
we also intend to continue to expand the marketing of new services to meet our customers needs 
northern border pipeline and midwestern gas transmission have begun contract extension discussions with customers for contracts that will expire prior to november  similar to other industries  the value of capacity on interstate pipelines is driven by supply and demand conditions 
in particular  with respect to northern border pipeline  the relationship between gas prices in canada and prices in the midwestern us markets will determine the underlying value of transportation 
this relationship  and natural gas markets overall  has been volatile  which is also an important factor in contracting for firm transportation capacity 
under northern border pipeline s ferc tariff  it may concurrently solicit bids for available capacity from other parties subject to the existing customer s rights to match the best offer 
during  after completion of this process  northern border pipeline received only bids to extend service from mid september to october  and all other existing customers rights to match an offer were terminated 
northern border pipeline is now in a position to contract with interested parties on a first come  first served basis 
based on current conditions  contracts for service on northern border pipeline may require discounts from maximum transportation rates established in its tariff and shorter duration than its existing contract portfolio 
additionally  northern border pipeline may enter into negotiated rate contracts involving charges established on the basis of canadian midwestern us gas price differentials or other factors 
regarding midwestern gas transmission  an agreement has been reached with its largest shipper  northern illinois gas company  to extend its negotiated rate contract for a three year term subject to regulatory approval and upstream capacity arrangements 
in february  northern border pipeline filed to amend the definition of company use gas  which is gas supplied by our shippers for our operations  to clarify the language by adding detail to the broad categories that comprise company use gas see item business ferc regulation 
relying upon the currently effective version of the tariff  northern border pipeline included in its collection of company use gas  quantities that were equivalent to the cost of electric power at its electric driven compressor stations  resulting in cost savings of approximately million annually 
pending the final outcome of this ferc proceeding  we may not realize electric power cost savings to the same extent for natural gas gathering and processing we also are developing our gas gathering and processing segment where we are building on our established business relationships with producers and marketers in the canadian and rocky mountain supply basins 
during  the pricing of gas produced from the powder river basin was depressed due to capacity constraints on pipelines to market hubs 
we expect to see continued build out of our gathering systems within the areas of acreage dedications we have secured  particularly in the powder river basin 
depending on the pace of production development  producer response to the basin wide eis and water discharge permitting  we expect to percent growth in aggregate gathered volumes on our powder river systems bear paw energy  bighorn and fort union during we expect growth in gas volumes for our pipelines and plants in the wind river  williston and western canadian sedimentary basins to be more modest  reflecting prospects for drilling activity within these production areas 
in addition  we are pursuing new acreage dedications in each of these areas 
the build out of our existing  and the addition of new acreage dedications should mitigate production declines and allow some further improvement in cost efficiencies 
also  our ownership in bighorn includes preferred a units  which effectively provide an incentive mechanism tied to the number of wells connected to the system 
whether such targets have been met is under discussion 
resolution of this matter  as expected  would result in income between and million for acquisitions finally  our objective is to continue to acquire complementary businesses 
our goal is approximately to million of capital expenditures annually in growth through acquisitions and internal development 
we target businesses that leverage our core competencies of energy transportation  are conservative in terms of commodity price risk  are located in the us and canada  and provide immediate earnings and cash flow contribution 
we anticipate financing our capital expenditures and acquisitions conservatively through an appropriate mix of additional borrowings and equity issuances 
although we regularly evaluate various acquisition opportunities  we cannot provide assurance that we will reach our goal each year and would also expect that  depending on specific opportunities that develop  acquisitions in some years could significantly exceed our goal stated above 
risk factors and information regarding forward looking statements statements in this annual report that are not historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance 
they involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the future results of our operations may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements include o the discussions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations update on the impact of enron s chapter filing on our business  o the discussions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook  and o the discussions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
although we believe that our expectations regarding future events are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business  we cannot assure you that our goals will be achieved or that our expectations regarding future developments will be realized 
with this in mind  you should consider the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements o the war with iraq  increasing military tension with regard to north korea  as well as the terrorist attacks of september  and subsequent unrest  have caused instability in the world s financial and commercial markets and have contributed to volatility in prices for natural gas 
in addition  since the september  attacks  the united states government has issued warnings that energy assets  including our nation s pipeline infrastructure  may be a target of future terrorist attacks 
o any customer s failure to perform its contractual obligations could adversely impact our cash flows and financial condition 
some of our shippers or their owners have experienced a deterioration of their financial condition 
should one or more file for bankruptcy protection  our ability to recover amounts owed or to resell the capacity would be impacted 
o since northern plains  northern border pipeline s operator  and nbp services  administrator for us  are wholly owned subsidiaries of enron and depend on enron and certain of its affiliates for some services they provide to us  potential further developments in the enron chapter proceeding may cause either or both northern plains and nbp services to be unable to perform under their agreements or to incur increases in costs to continue or replace the services provided by enron and its affiliates 
most recently  enron announced its intention to create a new pipeline operating entity  which will include northern plains  pan border and nbp services 
see update on the impact of enron s chapter filing on our business possible effects above 
o contracts on northern border pipeline and midwestern gas transmission will expire prior to november  on northern border pipeline  those contracts represent approximately of its system capacity 
the interstate pipelines ability to recontract capacity as existing contracts terminate for maximum transportation rates will be subject to a number of factors including availability of natural gas supplies from the western canadian sedimentary basin  the demand for natural gas in our market areas and the basis differential between the receipt and delivery points on our system 
see outlook above and item business interstate pipelines demand for transportation capacity 
o our interstate pipelines are subject to extensive regulation by the ferc governing all aspects of our business  including our transportation rates 
under northern border pipeline s rate case settlement  neither northern border pipeline nor its existing customers can seek rate changes until november  at which time northern border pipeline is obligated to file a rate case 
we cannot predict what challenges our interstate pipelines may have to their rates in the future 
see item business interstate pipelines ferc regulation 
o conflicts of interest may arise between our general partners and their affiliates on one hand  and us on the other hand 
as a result of these conflicts  the general partners may favor their own interests and the interests of their affiliates over the interests of our limited partners 
o we face competition from third parties in our natural gas transportation  gathering and processing businesses 
see item business interstate pipeline competition and business interstate pipelines future demand and competition 
o our operations are subject to federal and state agencies for environmental protection and operational safety 
we may incur substantial costs and liabilities in the future as a result of stricter environmental and safety laws  regulations and enforcement policies 
see item business environmental and safety matters 
o northern border pipeline s ability to operate its pipeline on certain tribal lands will depend on northern border pipeline s success in renegotiating before its right of way rights on tribal lands within the fort peck reservation 
see item properties 
northern border pipeline and the tribes  through a mediation process  have held settlement discussions and have reached a settlement in principle on the pipeline right of way lease and taxation issues  subject to final documentation and necessary governmental approvals 
if northern border pipeline is unable to recover the costs of the proposed settlement in its future rates  it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation 
o black mesa s contract to transport coal slurry terminates in december if black mesa is unable to extend or enter into a new arrangement for transportation of coal slurry  black mesa could incur significant costs and expenses for employee related matters  write off of recorded goodwill and removal of certain facilities 
o part of our business strategy is to expand existing assets and acquire additional assets and businesses that will allow us to increase our cash flow and distributions to unitholders 
unexpected costs or challenges may arise whenever we acquire new assets or businesses 
successful acquisitions require management and other personnel to devote significant amounts of time to new businesses or integrating the acquired assets with existing businesses 
o our ability to expand our midstream gas gathering business will depend in large part on the pace of drilling and production activity in the western canadian sedimentary  powder river  wind river and williston basins 
drilling and production activity will be impacted by a number of factors beyond our control  including demand for and prices of natural gas  producer response to the recently issued eis  the ability of producers to obtain necessary permits and capacity constraints on natural gas transmission pipelines that transport gas from the producing areas 
see item business natural gas gathering and processing segment future demand and competition 
o although our business strategy is to pursue fee based and fixed rate contracts  some of our gas processing facilities are subject to certain contracts that give us quantities of natural gas liquids as payment of our processing services 
the income and cash flow from these contracts will be impacted directly by changes in these commodity prices 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
o we may need new capital to finance future acquisitions and expansions 
if our access to capital is limited  this will impair our ability to execute our growth strategy 
enron s circumstances have caused the credit rating agencies to review the capital structure and earnings power of energy companies  including us 
as we acquire new businesses and make additional investments in existing businesses  we may need to increase borrowings and issue additional equity in order to maintain an appropriate capital structure 
this may impact the market value of our common units 
see debt and credit facilities and issuance of common units above 
o our indentures contain provisions that would require us to offer to repurchase our senior notes if moodys or standard poor s rating services rate our notes below investment grade 
see debt and credit facilities and issuance of common units above 
o under current law  we are treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and do not pay any income tax at the entity level 
in order to qualify for this treatment  we must derive more than of our annual gross income from specified investments and activities 
while we believe that we currently do qualify and intend to meet this income requirement  if we should fail we would be treated as if we were a newly formed corporation and the income we generate from the date of such failure would be subject to corporate income tax 
because the tax would be imposed on us  the cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced 
in addition  the entire amount of cash received by each unitholder would generally be taxed as a corporate dividend when received 
o on january   the bush administration released a proposal that would exclude certain corporate dividends from an individual s federal taxable income 
enactment of legislation reducing or eliminating the federal income tax on corporate dividends may cause certain investments to be more attractive to individual investors than an investment in our units 
we cannot predict whether the proposal will ultimately be enacted into law or if enacted  the potential impact on the market for our units 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us  or risks that we currently deem immaterial may impair our business operations 
any of the risk factors described above could significantly and adversely impair our operational results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to market risk through changes in commodity prices  exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
a control environment has been established which includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of financial instrument activities 
we have utilized and expect to continue to utilize financial instruments in the management of interest rate risks and our natural gas and natural gas liquids marketing activities to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing our exposure to interest rate and price fluctuations 
other than entering into a forward purchase of canadian dollars in to fund our acquisition of the canadian midstream assets  we have not used financial instruments in the management of exchange rates 
interest rate risk our interest rate exposure results from variable rate borrowings from commercial banks 
to mitigate potential fluctuations in interest rates  we attempt to maintain a significant portion of our consolidated debt portfolio in fixed rate debt 
we also use interest rate swaps as a means to manage interest expense by converting a portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt to take advantage of declining interest rates 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding  million of which was previously fixed rate debt that had been converted to variable rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps 
for additional information on our debt obligations and derivative instruments  see note and note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
as of december   approximately of our debt portfolio was in fixed rate debt 
if average interest rates change by one percent compared to rates in effect as of december   consolidated annual interest expense would change by approximately million 
this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate borrowings outstanding as of december  commodity price risk our gas gathering and processing businesses are subject to certain contracts that give them quantities of natural gas and natural gas liquids as partial consideration for processing services 
the income and cash flows from these contracts will be impacted by changes in prices for these commodities 
prior to considering the effects of any hedging  for each per million british thermal unit change in natural gas prices or for each per gallon change in natural gas liquid prices  our annual net income would change by approximately million 
this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical commodity prices on our projected gathering and processing volumes for we have hedged to of our commodity price risk in
