the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  investments  restructuring costs and legal contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues consist of fixed monthly fees and usage fees generally based on per minute or transaction rates 
unbilled revenue consists of earned but unbilled revenue which results from the weekly billing cycle that was implemented at the premiere conferencing operating segment during the third quarter of deferred revenue consists of payments made by customers in advance of the time services are rendered 
the company s revenue recognition policies are consistent with the guidance in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
a and b 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
prior to the recognition of revenue  the company makes a decision that collectibility is reasonably assured 
over time  management analyzes accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  and changes in the company s customer payment terms and trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable in any accounting period 
the accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment to their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities purchased 
the company evaluates acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant adverse change in physical condition or manner of use of an asset  significant adverse change in legal factors or negative industry or economic trends  
table of contents a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and an expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  the company ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
the company recorded approximately million of goodwill amortization during in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform an initial impairment review of its goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
a third party review was completed in the fourth quarter of and no impairment was identified 
other intangible assets with finite lives that do not meet the criteria of sfas no 
continue to be amortized in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this pronouncement became effective in the company recognizes an impairment loss when the fair value is less than the carrying value of such assets and the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable 
the impairment loss  if applicable  is calculated based on the estimated future cash flows compared to the carrying value of the long lived asset 
prior to  when the company determined that the carrying value of long lived assets  intangibles and related goodwill may not have been recoverable in accordance with the indicators of impairment  as stated in sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of the company recognized an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flow was less than the carrying value of such assets 
the impairment loss  if applicable  was calculated based on the fair value or sum of the discounted cash flows compared to the carrying value 
the discounted cash flow method uses a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s business model 
see the asset impairments section of management s discussion and analysis above for a discussion of impairments recorded during and net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
future events could cause the company to conclude that the current estimates used should be changed and that goodwill associated with acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its taxes in each of the jurisdictions of operation 
this process involves management estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  and was million and million  net of a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
the company has recorded the valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on the company s estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which it operates and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance that could materially impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the company also records a provision for certain international  federal and state tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation  when needed 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to challenges from us and us tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
further  during the ordinary course of business other changing facts and circumstances may impact the company s ability to utilize tax benefits as well as the estimated taxes to be paid in future periods 
management believes it has appropriately accrued for tax exposures 
if the company is required to pay an amount less than or exceeding its provisions for uncertain tax matters  the financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the matter is resolved 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the company may need to adjust tax accounts which could materially impact its financial condition and results of operations 
investments 
the company has historically made investments in various companies that are engaged in emerging technologies related to the internet 
either the cost or equity method is used to account for these investments in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
in addition  the company has investments in equity securities of companies with readily determinable fair values accounted for in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
sfas no 
mandates that a determination be made of the appropriate classification for equity securities with a readily determinable fair value and all debt securities at the time of purchase and re evaluation of such designation as of each balance sheet date 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
see the asset impairments and obligations investments section of management s discussion and analysis above for a discussion of investment impairments recorded during and total investments  in the form of marketable securities available for sale  as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
restructuring costs 
the restructuring accruals are based on certain estimates and judgments related to contractual obligations and related costs 
the restructuring accruals related to contractual lease obligations could be materially affected by factors such as the company s ability to secure sublessees  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the company may need to establish additional restructuring accruals or reverse accrual amounts accordingly 
legal contingencies 
the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings as disclosed in item  legal proceedings  of this report 
management has accrued an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
the company does not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition or results of operations  although no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s estimates and judgments or accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
these estimates are subject to change and the company adjusts the financial impact in the period in which they are resolved 
see the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles

table of contents risk factors affecting future performance you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties we describe below before investing in ptek 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could develop 
other risks and uncertainties that we have not predicted or evaluated could also affect our company 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected  and the trading price of our common stock could decline  resulting in the loss of all or part of your investment 
risks related to our industry the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully against existing and future competitors  which may make it difficult to maintain or increase our market share and revenue 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  more robust product offerings  more comprehensive support organizations  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  personnel  marketing  engineering  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands 
they may also be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services 
we believe that our current competitors are likely to expand their product and service offerings and new competitors are likely to enter our markets 
acquisitions or strategic alliances  including those among existing and new competitors or their attempts to integrate their products and services may result in greater competition 
increased competition could result in price pressure on our products and services and a decrease in our market share in the various markets in which we compete  either of which could hinder our ability to grow our revenue 
the development of alternatives to our products and services may cause us to lose customers and market share and may hinder our ability to maintain or grow our revenue 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
we expect new products and services  and enhancements to existing products and services  to be developed and introduced that will compete with our products and services 
technological advances may result in the development and commercial availability of alternatives to our products and services or new methods of delivering our products and services 
companies may develop and offer product features  service offerings or pricing options which are more attractive to customers than those currently offered by us 
these new products or services  or methods of delivering these products or services  could among other things cause our existing products and services to become obsolete  be more cost effective  which could result in significant pricing pressure on our products and services  or allow our existing and potential customers to meet their own telecommunications needs without using our services 
technological changes that make our products obsolete  or changes in technology that allow competitors to offer products and services that replace our existing products and services  could cause us to lose customers  market share and revenue 

table of contents if new products and services that we develop and introduce are not accepted in the marketplace  we may lose market share and our revenue may decrease 
we must continually introduce new products and services in response to technological changes  evolving industry standards and customer demands for enhancements to our existing products and services 
we will not be able to increase our revenue if we are unable to develop new products and services  we experience delays in the introduction of new products and services  or our new products and services do not achieve market acceptance 
our ability to successfully develop and market new products and services and enhancements that respond to technological changes  evolving industry standards or customer demands  is dependent on our ability to anticipate changes in industry standards  anticipate and apply advances in technologies  enhance our software  applications  equipment  systems and networks  attract and retain qualified and creative technical personnel  develop effective marketing  pricing and distribution strategies for new products and services  and avoid difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products and services or enhancements 
we are subject to pricing pressures for our products and services  which could cause us to lose market share and revenue 
we compete for consumers based on price 
a decrease in the rates charged for communications services by our competitors could cause us to reduce the rates we charge for our products and services 
if we cannot compete based on price  we may lose market share 
if we reduce our rates without increasing our volume or our market share  our revenue could decrease 
consolidation in the telecommunications industry could lead to pricing pressure on our products and services and could be disruptive to our licensing and strategic relationships 
the telecommunications industry has experienced  and we believe it will continue to experience  consolidation 
consolidation in the telecommunications industry  including consolidations involving our customers  competitors and strategic partners  could lead to pricing pressure on our products and services and could result in increased costs 
continuing softness in the economy is having a disproportionate effect on the telecommunications industry 
the downturn in general economic conditions  particularly in the telecommunications services industry  has forced several of our customers and suppliers  including worldcom and global crossing  to file for protection from creditors under the united states bankruptcy code or to reconfigure their capital structure 
some of these companies had significant debt servicing requirements and were unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to both service their debt and to maintain their business operations 
we believe that we use reasonable measures to determine the financial condition of potential and existing customers and suppliers 
however  there can be no assurance that our customers or suppliers will remain financially viable  or that the measures we follow will be effective 
if general economic conditions in the united states remain at current levels for an extended period of time or worsen  our business could be adversely affected 
risks related to our company our future success depends on market acceptance of our new products and services 
market acceptance of our new products and services often requires that individuals and enterprises accept new ways of communicating and exchanging information 
a decline in the demand for  or the failure to achieve 
table of contents broad market acceptance of  our new products and services could hinder our ability to maintain and increase our revenue 
we believe that broad market acceptance of our new products and services will depend on several factors  including ease of use  price  reliability  access and quality of service  system security  product functionality  and the effectiveness of strategic marketing and distribution relationships 
if we do not met these challenges  our new products and services may not achieve broad market acceptance or market acceptance may not occur quickly enough to justify our investment in these products and services 
concerns regarding security of transactions and transmitting confidential information over the internet may have an adverse impact on the market acceptance of our web enabled products and services 
the concern regarding the security of confidential information transmitted over the internet may prevent many potential customers from using internet related products and services 
if our web enabled services  such as messagereach  do not include sufficient security features  our web enabled products and services may not gain market acceptance  or there may be additional legal exposure 
despite the measures we have taken  our infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break ins  viruses or similar problems 
if a person circumvents our security measures  he or she could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruption in our operations 
security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability 
we may be required to make significant investments in efforts to protect against and remedy these types of security breaches 
additionally  as electronic commerce becomes more widespread  our customers will become more concerned about security 
if we are unable to adequately address these concerns  we may be unable to sell our web enabled products and services 
if our quarterly results do not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  our stock price may decrease 
quarterly revenue is difficult to forecast because the market for our services is rapidly evolving 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations as to future revenue 
if revenue levels are below expectations  we may be unable or unwilling to reduce expenses proportionately and operating results would likely be adversely affected 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to all of the risk factors listed herein  it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
our operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
specific factors that may cause our future operating results to vary include the unique nature of strategic relationships into which we may enter in the future  the financial performance of our strategic partners  changes in operating expenses  the reliability and performance of our products and services  
table of contents the timing of new product and service announcements  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and services  the success or failure of past or potential future acquisitions  changes in legislation and regulations that may affect the competitive environment for our products and services  and general economic and seasonal factors 
our debt could harm our liquidity and ability to obtain additional financing  and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
to service our debt  we will require a significant amount of cash  and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
in  we incurred million in indebtedness by issuing convertible notes to the public 
we have significant interest payment obligations as a result of the convertible notes  and the convertible notes will mature on july   at which time the full amount of the principal will be due 
in addition to the convertible notes  at december  the company had million outstanding under its various credit facilities 
our debt could inhibit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  interest payments  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
our debt could also harm our liquidity  because a substantial portion of available cash from operations may have to be applied to meet debt service requirements 
in the event of a cash shortfall  we could be forced to reduce other expenditures and forego potential acquisitions and investments to be able to meet these debt repayment requirements 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and other liquidity needs will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based upon current levels of operations and continued cost saving measures  we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  interest payments  acquisitions and other purposes for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flows from operations at or above current levels or that anticipated cost savings will be realized 
we cannot assure that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we will continue to evaluate the most efficient use of our capital  and we will likely seek strategic alternatives for portions of our business or a refinancing arrangement to address the maturity of the convertible notes on july  depending upon market conditions  these alternatives may include purchasing  refinancing or otherwise retiring a portion of the convertible notes in the open market 
we cannot assure  however  that we will be able to timely refinance any of our indebtedness  including the convertible notes  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we do not typically have long term contractual agreements with our customers and our customers may not transact business with us in the future 
we expect that the information and telecommunications services markets will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies  possibly including alternative technologies that are more sophisticated and cost effective than our technologies 
we do not typically have long term contractual agreements with our customers  and our customers may not continue to transact business with us in the future if  among other things  any of the following occur our products and services become obsolete  competitors develop products and services that are more sophisticated  efficient or cost effective  or 
table of contents technological advances allow our customers to satisfy their own telecommunications needs 
one of our customers accounts for a significant amount of revenues and any loss of business from that customer may hurt our financial performance and cause our stock price to decline 
premiere conferencing has historically relied on sales through a particular customer  ibm  for a significant portion of its revenues 
sales to that customer accounted for approximately of consolidated revenues from continuing operations of premiere conferencing s revenues in  of consolidated revenues from continuing operations of premiere conferencing s revenues in  and of consolidated revenues from continuing operations of premiere conferencing s revenues in premiere conferencing s relationship with that customer may not continue at historical levels  and there is no long term price protection for services provided to that customer 
a loss in revenues from that customer or diminution in the relationship with that customer  or a decrease in average sales price without an offsetting increase in volume  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not attract and retain highly qualified and creative technical and support personnel we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
we believe that to be successful we must hire and retain highly qualified and creative engineering  product development and customer support personnel 
competition in the recruitment of highly qualified and creative personnel in the information and telecommunications services industry is intense 
we have in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled technical employees with appropriate qualifications 
we may not be able to retain our key technical employees and we may not be able to attract qualified personnel in the future 
if we are not able to locate  hire and retain qualified technical personnel  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
our business may suffer if we do not retain the services of our chief executive officer 
we believe that our continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of boland t 
jones  our chairman and chief executive officer 
the familiarity of mr 
jones with the markets in which we compete and emerging technologies  such as the internet  makes him especially critical to our success 
we maintain key man life insurance on mr

downtime in our network infrastructure could result in the loss of significant customers 
we currently maintain facilities with telecommunications equipment that routes telephone calls and computer telephony equipment in locations throughout the world 
the delivery of our products and services is dependent  in part  upon our ability to protect the equipment and data at our facilities with telecommunications equipment that routes telephone calls against damage that may be caused by fire  power loss  technical failures  unauthorized intrusion  natural disasters  sabotage and other similar events 
despite taking a variety of precautions  we have experienced downtime in our networks from time to time and we may experience downtime in the future 
these types of service interruptions could result in the loss of significant customers  which could cause us to lose revenue 
we take substantial precautions to protect ourselves and our customers from events that could interrupt delivery of our services 
these precautions include physical security systems  uninterruptible power supplies  on site power generators  upgraded backup hardware  fire protection systems and other contingency plans 
in addition  some of our networks are designed so that the data on each network server is duplicated on a separate network server 
we also maintain business interruption insurance providing for aggregate coverage of approximately million per policy year 
however  we may not be able to maintain this insurance in the future  it may not continue to be available at reasonable prices  and it may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that we experience due to our inability to provide services to our customers 
if we fail to predict growth in our network usage and add needed capacity  the quality of our service offerings may suffer 
as network usage grows  we will need to add capacity to our hardware  software and facilities with telecommunications equipment that route telephone calls 
this means that we continuously attempt to predict growth in our network usage and add capacity accordingly 
if we do not accurately predict and efficiently manage 
table of contents growth in our network usage  the quality of our service offerings may suffer and we may lose customers 
our inability to efficiently utilize or renegotiate minimum purchase requirements in our long distance telecommunications supply agreements could decrease our profitability 
our ability to maintain and expand our business depends  in part  on our ability to continue to obtain telecommunications services on favorable terms from telecommunications service providers 
contracts with some of our telecommunications service providers contain minimum purchase requirements through in addition  certain circuits that we purchase are subject to term requirements  including penalties for early termination of such circuits 
the total amount of the minimum purchase requirements in was approximately million  and we incurred metered telecommunications costs in excess of these minimums 
it is possible that other suppliers may provide similar services at lower prices and we may not be able to renegotiate our current supply agreements to achieve comparable lower rates 
further  we can give no assurance that we will be able to utilize the minimum amount of services that we are required to purchase under these agreements 
if we are unable to obtain telecommunications services on favorable terms  or if we are required to purchase more services than we are able to utilize in running our business  the costs of providing our services would likely increase  which could decrease our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
software failures or errors may result in failure of our platforms and or networks  which could result in increased costs and lead to interruptions in our services and losses of significant customers and revenue 
the software that we have developed and utilize in providing our products and services may contain undetected errors 
although we generally engage in extensive testing of our software prior to introducing the software onto any of our networks and or product equipment  errors may be found in the software after the software goes into use 
any of these errors may result in partial or total failure of our networks  additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development or to add programming personnel to complete a development project  and loss of revenue because of the inability of customers to use our networks or the cancellation of services by significant customers 
we maintain technology errors and omissions insurance coverage of million per policy aggregate 
however  we may not be able to maintain this insurance or it may not continue to be available at reasonable prices 
even if we maintain this insurance  it may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses we experience due to our inability to provide services to our customers 
interruption in long distance telecommunications services could result in service interruptions and a loss of significant customers and revenue 
our ability to maintain and expand our business depends  in part  on our ability to continue to obtain telecommunications services on favorable terms from long distance carriers 
we do not own a transmission network 
as a result  we depend on worldcom  at t and other long distance carriers for transmission of our customers long distance calls 
these long distance telecommunications services generally are procured under supply agreements with multiyear terms  some of which are subject to various early termination penalties and minimum purchase requirements 
we have not experienced significant losses in the past due to interruptions of long distance service  but we might experience these types of losses in the future 
the partial or total loss of our ability to receive or terminate telephone calls could result in service interruptions and a loss of significant customers and revenue 
we depend on local phone companies that provide local transmission services  known as local exchange carriers  for call origination and termination 
the partial or total loss of the ability to receive or terminate calls could result in service interruptions and a loss of significant customers and revenue 
we have not experienced significant losses in the past due to interruptions of service at terminating carriers  but we might experience these types of losses in the future 
if we have to change our network transmission provider  we could experience interruptions in our services and increased costs  which could cause us to lose customers 
we lease capacity on the worldcom communications network to provide network connections and data transmission services 
our telecommunications agreement with worldcom expires on december  our ability to maintain network connections is dependent upon our access to transmission facilities provided by worldcom or an alternative provider 
we may not be able to continue our relationship with worldcom beyond the 
table of contents terms of our current agreements and we may not be able to find an alternative provider on terms as favorable as those offered by worldcom or on any other terms 
if we have to change our network transmission provider  we could experience interruptions in our service and or increased costs  which could adversely affect our customer relationships and customer retention 
our inability to resolve pending billing disputes with worldcom could result in significant costs or service disruptions 
we purchase telecommunications and other network services from worldcom under numerous transmission agreements 
currently  we have several significant outstanding disputes with worldcom regarding the charges billed by worldcom under those agreements 
on july   worldcom and certain of its subsidiary corporations filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the bankruptcy code entitles a debtor to accept or reject executory contracts  that is contracts where some future act remains to be done  as in the case of our agreements with worldcom to purchase transmission and other network services 
a party to a rejected contract may be entitled to damages from the debtor for breach of contract  however  such a claim would likely be an unsecured claim 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to resolve our billing disputes with worldcom  that worldcom will accept  reject or request to renegotiate our existing agreements  or that we will be successful in asserting any rights of set off against amounts due to us from worldcom 
if we are unable to resolve our billing dispute with worldcom or if worldcom rejects certain of our agreements  we could experience increased costs and or interruptions in our service  which could adversely affect our business 
any significant difficulty in obtaining equipment could lead to interruption in service and loss of customers and revenue  and technological obsolescence of our equipment could result in substantial capital expenditures 
we do not manufacture equipment used in providing our products and services  and this equipment is currently available from a limited number of sources 
although we have not historically experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining equipment required for our operations and believe that viable alternative suppliers exist  shortages may arise in the future or alternative suppliers may not be available 
our inability to obtain equipment in the future could result in delays or reduced delivery of messages  which could lead to a loss of customers and revenue 
in addition  technological advances may result in the development of new equipment and changing industry standards  which could cause our equipment to become obsolete 
these events could require us to invest significant capital in upgrading or replacing our equipment 
our financial performance could cause future write downs of goodwill or other intangible assets in future periods 
we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  with the adoption of sfas no 
 we will cease to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and will be required to perform an annual impairment review thereafter 
the review in resulted in an impairment of certain other intangible assets at xpedite of approximately million 
subsequent reviews could result in impairment write downs to goodwill and or other intangible assets 
at december   the company had million of other intangible assets reflected on our financial statements for which amortization will continue 
we could be required to make payments in the future in connection with the sale of our voicecom business unit 
in connection with the sale of our voicecom business unit in march  we agreed to retain certain liabilities relating to our operation of the unit prior to the closing of the transaction  including liabilities for certain taxes  contingent liabilities  litigation claims  and unknown liabilities the excluded liabilities 
as a result  we could incur a liability in the future related to the excluded liabilities 
in addition  pursuant to the transaction  the buyer assumed or subleased substantially all of the real estate utilized in our voicecom business 
the buyer also committed to buy certain telecommunications and other services and to manage and utilize certain regulated and other assets held by our voicecom operating subsidiaries 
an affiliate of the buyer guaranteed the timely payment of a substantial portion of these voicecom liabilities 
of the voicecom liabilities  approximately million represents capital leases guaranteed by us 
accordingly  in the event the buyer or buyer s affiliate fails to make payments as required  we could be required to make significant payments in the future 

table of contents our articles of incorporation and bylaws and georgia corporate law may inhibit a takeover  which may not be in the interests of shareholders 
there are several provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and georgia corporate law that may inhibit a takeover  even when a takeover may be in the interests of our shareholders 
for example  our board of directors is empowered to issue preferred stock without shareholder action 
the existence of this blank check preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of ptek by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
our articles of incorporation also divide the board of directors into three classes  as nearly equal in size as possible  with staggered three year terms 
the classification of the board of directors could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of ptek because only one third of the board is up for election each year 
we are also subject to provisions of the georgia business corporation code that relate to business combinations with interested shareholders  which can serve to inhibit a takeover 
in addition to considering the effects of any action on us and our shareholders  our articles of incorporation permit our board of directors and the committees and individual members of the board to consider the interests of various constituencies  including employees  customers  suppliers  and creditors  communities in which we maintain offices or operations  and other factors which they deem pertinent  in carrying out and discharging their duties and responsibilities and in determining what is believed to be our best interests 
our rights plan may also inhibit a takeover  which may not be in the interests of shareholders 
in june  our board of directors declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock 
each right entitles the registered holder to purchase one one thousandth of a share of series c junior participating preferred stock at a price of sixty dollars per one thousandth of a series c preferred share  subject to adjustment 
the rights may have anti takeover effects because they will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
however  the rights should not interfere with any merger  statutory share exchange or other business combination approved by the board of directors since the rights may be terminated by the board of directors at any time on or prior to the close of business ten business days after announcement by us that a person has become an acquiring person 
the rights are intended to encourage persons who may seek to acquire control of us to initiate an acquisition through negotiations with the board of directors 
however  the effect of the rights may be to discourage a third party from making a partial tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain a substantial equity position in the equity securities of  or seeking to obtain control of  us 
risks related to past acquisitions if we cannot successfully integrate and consolidate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations  we may not realize sufficient cost savings and economies of scale 
we are continuing to integrate the operations of acquired businesses by attempting to eliminate duplicative and unnecessary costs 
the successful integration and consolidation of the operations of acquired businesses into our operations is critical to our future performance 
if we cannot successfully integrate and consolidate the operations of acquired businesses with our operations on schedule or at all  these acquisitions may not result in sufficient cost savings or economies of scale and operational synergies may not develop 
potential challenges to the successful integration and consolidation of the operations of acquired businesses include consolidation of service centers and work forces  elimination of unnecessary costs  and integration and retention of new personnel 
if we cannot successfully integrate technologies  products  services and systems from acquired businesses with ours  we may not generate sufficient revenue and operational synergies may not develop 
we are continuing to integrate previously acquired technologies  products  service offerings and systems 
we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulty integrating incompatible systems of acquired 
table of contents businesses into our networks 
as a result  our integration plans may materially change in the future 
if we cannot successfully integrate technologies  products  services and systems from acquired businesses with ours  we may not generate sufficient revenue and operational synergies may not develop 
challenges to the successful integration of acquired technologies  products  service offerings and systems include  among other things  the following localization of our products and services  integration of technologies  telecommunications equipment and networks  cross selling of products and services to our customer base and customer bases of acquired businesses  and compliance with regulatory requirements 
risks related to possible future acquisitions we may decide to pursue future acquisitions and we may face risks in acquiring and integrating other businesses  products and technologies 
we may decide to pursue future acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that we believe will complement our business 
as a result  we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities  frequently engage in acquisition discussions  conduct due diligence activities in connection with possible acquisitions  and  where appropriate  engage in acquisition negotiations 
we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired operations into our existing operations or expand into new markets 
in addition  we compete for acquisitions and expansion opportunities with companies that have substantially greater resources  and competition with these companies for acquisition targets could result in increased prices for possible targets 
acquisitions also involve numerous additional risks to the company and investors  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the assumption of known and unknown liabilities  and adverse financial impact from the write off of software development costs and the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
if we fail to assimilate and retain key employees of future businesses that we acquire  it could jeopardize the success of the acquisition 
assimilation and retention of the key employees of an acquired company are generally important to the success of an acquisition 
if we fail to assimilate and retain any key employees of any business we acquire  the acquisition may not result in revenue growth  operational synergies or product and service enhancements  which could jeopardize the success of the acquisition 
future acquisitions may involve restructuring and other special charges  which may cause our financial performance to suffer during the period in which the charge is taken 
we have taken  and in the future may take  charges in connection with acquisitions  which may cause our financial performance to suffer during the period in which the charge is taken 
in addition  the costs and expenses incurred may exceed the estimates upon which these charges are based 

table of contents risks related to intellectual property we may not be able to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights  which could result in the loss of our rights or increased costs 
we rely primarily on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights and technology  brand and marks 
these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection of our proprietary rights and technology 
if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary rights and technology  we could lose those rights and incur substantial costs policing and defending those rights 
our proprietary rights and technology include confidential information and trade secrets that we attempt to protect through confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions in our licensing  services  reseller and other agreements 
we typically attempt to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through these contractual provisions for the term of the applicable agreement and  to the extent permitted by applicable law  for some negotiated period of time following termination of the agreement  typically one to two years at a minimum 
our means of protecting our intellectual property  proprietary rights and technology may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the us furthermore  some of our systems  such as those used in our document distribution business are not proprietary and  as a result  this information may be acquired or duplicated by existing and potential competitors 
if claims alleging patent  copyright or trademark infringement are brought against us and successfully prosecuted against us  it could result in substantial costs 
many patents  copyrights and trademarks have been issued in the general areas of information services  telecommunications  computer telephony and the internet 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of our business  we have been and expect to continue to be  subject to third party claims that our current or future products or services infringe the patent  copyright or trademark rights or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
claims alleging patent  copyright or trademark infringement may be brought against us with respect to current or future products or services 
if these types of actions or claims are brought we may not ultimately prevail and any claiming parties may have significantly greater resources than we have to pursue litigation of these types of claims 
any infringement claim  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming and a diversion to management  result in costly litigation  cause delays in introducing new products and services or enhancements  result in costly royalty or licensing agreements  or cause us to discontinue use of the challenged technology  tradename or service mark at potentially significant expense associated with the marketing of a new name or the development or purchase of replacement technology 
examples of prior and current infringement claims include the following in february  we entered into a long term nonexclusive license agreement with audiofax ip llc settling a patent infringement suit filed by audiofax in june effective april   this initial license agreement was amended to include xpedite within the coverage of the license 
in september  one of our subsidiaries also entered into a long term nonexclusive license agreement with audiofax 
prior to its acquisition by us  xpedite received a letter from cable wireless  inc informing xpedite that cable wireless had received a demand letter from audiofax claiming that some cable wireless products and services infringed audiofax s patent rights 
cable wireless initially sought indemnification from xpedite for this claim 
subsequent to our acquisition of xpedite  cable wireless notified us of the audiofax claim and sought indemnification directly from us 
in  xpedite received an additional letter from cable wireless informing xpedite of the existence of one of their patents and the potential applicability of that patent on xpedite s products and services 
in december  we entered into a settlement agreement with cable wireless settling all disputes over the indemnification claim and potential applicability of their patent to our products and services 

table of contents we have received letters from ronald a 
katz technology licensing  lp katz  aerotel limited aerotel usa  inc and nortel networks  inc  informing us of the existence of their respective patents or patent portfolios and the potential applicability of those patents on our products and services 
we are currently considering each of these matters 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  however  we are unable to predict the outcome of any potential litigation  and any adverse outcome could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even if we were to prevail in this type of challenge  our business could be adversely affected by the diversion of management attention and litigation costs 
certain of our customers have alleged that we are obligated to indemnify them against patent infringement claims made by katz against such customers 
we do not believe that we have an obligation to indemnify such customers  however  due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we are unable to predict the outcome of any potential litigation  and any adverse outcome could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even if we were to prevail in this type of challenge  our business could be adversely affected by the diversion of management attention and litigation costs

risks related to government regulation us or other government regulations and legal uncertainties related to the internet and electronic communications may place financial burdens on our business related to compliance 
currently  there are few laws or regulations directed specifically at electronic commerce and the internet 
however  because of the internet s popularity and increasing use  new laws and regulations may be adopted 
these laws and regulations may cover issues such as collection and use of data from web site visitors  privacy  e mail  network and information security  spamming  pricing  content  copyrights and other intellectual property  changes in telecommunications regulations  online gambling  distribution and quality of goods and services 
the enactment of any additional laws or regulations may impede the growth of the internet  which could impede the growth of our web enabled products and services and place additional financial burdens on our business in order to comply with new laws and regulations 
laws and regulations directly applicable to electronic commerce or internet communications are becoming more prevalent 
for example  the united states congress has enacted laws regarding on line copyright infringement and the protection of information collected on line from children 
although these laws may not have a direct adverse effect on our business  they add to the legal and regulatory uncertainty regarding the internet and possible future costs of regulatory compliance 
our failure to comply with various government regulations related to traditional telephone service providers could impair our ability to deliver our products and services 
one of our subsidiaries  pci  provides regulated long distance telecommunications services and is subject to regulation by the fcc and by various state public service and public utility commissions 
pci is  and our other subsidiaries may be  affected by regulatory decisions  trends and policies made by these agencies 
in addition  various international authorities may also seek to regulate  or to impose requirements with respect to  the services provided by pci or our other subsidiaries 
if pci fails to comply with these various government regulations  or if our other subsidiaries were required to submit to the jurisdiction of such government authorities  we could be prohibited from providing portions of our services or we could be subject to fines  forfeitures or other penalties for noncompliance 
we use reasonable efforts to ensure that pci s operations comply with regulatory requirements 
pci  however  may not be currently in compliance with all fcc and state regulatory requirements 
furthermore  pci s facilities do not prevent its customers from making long distance calls in any state  including states in which it currently is not authorized to provide intrastate telecommunications services 
pci s provision of long distance telecommunications services in states where it is not in compliance with public utility commission requirements could result in prohibitions on providing long distance service and subject us to fines  forfeitures or other penalties for noncompliance 
we may become subject to new laws and regulations involving services and transactions in the areas of electronic commerce  which could increase costs of compliance 
in conducting our business  we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to commercial transactions generally  such as the uniform commercial code  and we are also subject to the electronic funds transfer rules embodied in regulation e promulgated by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
congress has held hearings regarding  and various agencies are considering  whether to regulate providers of services and transactions in the electronic commerce market 
it is possible that congress  the states or various government agencies could impose new or additional requirements on the electronic commerce market or entities operating therein 
if enacted  these laws  rules and regulations could be imposed on our business and industry and could result in substantial compliance costs 

table of contents recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of  which became law in july  has resulted in changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosures and compliance practices 
that act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to final rules and rule proposals already made  and nasdaq has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies whose securities are quoted on nasdaq 
we expect these developments to increase our legal compliance costs  and to make some activities more time consuming 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of the additional costs we may incur as a result 
risks related to international operations and expansion our future success depends on our expansion into international markets and revenue from international operations may not grow enough to offset the cost of expansion 
a component of our strategy is our planned expansion into international markets 
revenue from international operations may not grow enough to offset the cost of establishing and expanding these international operations 
we currently deliver multimedia messaging and conferencing services worldwide 
while we have significant international experience in the delivery of our multimedia messaging services  we have only limited experience in marketing and distributing our conferencing services 
accordingly  we may not be able to successfully market  sell and deliver our conferencing services in the new international markets 
there are risks inherent in international operations that could hinder our international growth strategy 
our ability to achieve future success will depend in part on the expansion of our international operations 
there are difficulties and risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could prevent us from selling our products and services in other countries or hinder our expansion once we have established international operations  including  among other things  the following burdensome regulatory requirements and unexpected changes in these requirements  export restrictions and controls relating to technology  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political and economic instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and other parts of the world  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
we could experience losses from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we conduct business outside the us and some of our expenses and revenue are derived in foreign currencies 
in particular  a significant portion of our multimedia messaging business is conducted outside the us and a significant portion of our revenue and expenses from that business are derived in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we could experience material losses due to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
we have not experienced any material losses from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  but we could in the future
