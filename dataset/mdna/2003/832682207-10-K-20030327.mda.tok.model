the warrants will not be tradable separate from the related debt until the later of december  or nine months after the issuance of the warrants being transferred 
in connection with the december  amendment  we paid approximately million in amendment fees 
the amendment fees and the fair value of the warrants to be issued in connection with the december  amendment have been accounted for as deferred financing fees included in other assets in the financial statements 
our management believes that cash generated from operations  available cash and amounts available under our senior credit facility will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs at our current level of operations and organic growth through the next twelve months  although no assurance can be given in this regard  particularly with respect to amounts available under our credit facility  as discussed above 
further  there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to enable us to service our indebtedness 
our future operating performance and ability to service or refinance indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond our control 
as at december   contractual repayments due within each of the next five years are as follows in millions contractual obligations and thereafter total long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations recently issued accounting standards in august  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded as a liability  at fair value  in the period in which the company incurs the obligation 
the statement is effective for fiscal and the company expects no material effect as a result of this statement 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities statement  which nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity eitf 
statement recognizes the liability for an exit or disposal activity only when a liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
currently  a commitment to an exit or disposal plan is sufficient to record the majority of the costs 
statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company expects the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its existing restructuring plans as these plans were initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of eitf in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others fin  which requires certain disclosures of obligations under guarantees 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for the company s year ended december  effective for  fin also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees entered into or modified after december   based on the fair value of the guarantee 
the company has adopted the disclosure requirements in its consolidated financial statements refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
the company has not determined the impact of the measurement requirements of fin in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
the consolidation provisions of fin are effective for all newly created variable interest entities created after january   and are applicable to exiting variable interest entities as of the company s third quarter beginning july  the company does not have an interest in any variable interest entities and  therefore  does not expect fin to have any impact 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reduces the accounts receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected 
a specific allowance is recorded against customer receivables that are considered to be impaired based on the company s knowledge of the financial condition of its customers 
in determining the amount of the allowance  the company considers factors including the length of time the receivables have been outstanding  customer and industry concentrations  current business environment and historical experience 
unanticipated changes in the liquidity or financial position of our customers may require additional provisions for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation inventories are valued on a first in  first out basis at the lower of cost and replacement cost for raw materials and at the lower of cost and net realizable value for work in progress and finished goods 
inventories include an application of relevant overhead 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand 
the company writes down estimated obsolete or excess inventory for the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based on customer forecasts  shrinkage  the aging and future demand of the inventory  past experience with specific customers and the ability to sell back inventory to customers or suppliers 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional provisions may be required 
restructuring and other charges in response to excess capacity caused by the slowing technology end market  the company recorded restructuring and other charges aimed at reducing its cost structure 
in connection with exit activities  the company recorded charges for inventory write downs  employee termination costs  lease and other contractual obligations  long lived asset impairment and other exit related costs 
these charges were incurred pursuant to formal plans developed by management 
the recognition of restructuring and other charges required the company to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activities 
the estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring the recording of additional charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  the company evaluates the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provision are for their intended purposed in accordance with the developed exit plans 
long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset groupings to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
effective january   the company adopted the new accounting standard issued in  which is summarized in note q ii  changes in accounting policies 
the adoption of this new accounting standard did not affect the company s financial statements as at the date of adoption 
income tax valuation allowance in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  change of control limitations  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon consideration of these factors  management believes the recorded valuation allowance related to the loss carryforwards is appropriate 
however  in the event that actual results differ from estimates or management adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
forward looking statements a number of the matters and subject areas discussed in this form k are forward looking in nature 
the discussion of such matters and subject areas is qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally  these expectations may differ materially from smtc s actual future experience involving any one or more of such matters and subject areas 
smtc cautions readers that all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report on form k regarding smtc s financial position and business strategy may constitute forward looking statements 
all of these forward looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions made by smtc s management  which although believed to be reasonable  are inherently uncertain 
therefore  undue reliance should not be placed on such estimates and statements 
no assurance can be given that any of such estimates or statements will be realized  and it is likely that actual results will differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include increased competition  increased costs  the inability to implement our business plan and maintain covenant compliance under our credit agreement  the loss or retirement of key members of management  increases in smtc s cost of borrowings or lack of availability of additional debt or equity capital on terms considered reasonable by management  adverse state  federal or foreign legislation or regulation or adverse determinations by regulators  changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which smtc may compete and fluctuations in demand in the electronics industry  the inability to manage inventory levels efficiently in light of changes in market conditions  and the inability to sustain historical margins as the industry develops 
smtc has attempted to identify certain of the factors that it currently believes may cause actual future experiences to differ from smtc s current expectations regarding the relevant matter or subject area 
in addition to the items specifically discussed in the foregoing  smtc s business and results of operations are subject to the risks and uncertainties described under the heading factors that may affect future results below 
the operations and results of smtc s business may also be subject to the effect of other risks and uncertainties 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  items described from time to time in smtc s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
factors that may affect future results risks related to our business and industry we are exposed to general economic conditions  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending  our sales have declined from to in particular  sales to oems in the telecommunications and networking industries worldwide were impacted during if economic conditions worsen or fail to improve  we may experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
a majority of our revenue comes from a small number of customers  if we lose any of our largest customers  our revenue could decline significantly 
our largest three customers in were ibm  dell and alcatel which represented approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue in our top ten largest customers including ibm  dell and alcatel collectively represented approximately of our total revenue in during the second quarter of  the company informed dell of its intention to terminate its supply agreement with dell and to end production over the third quarter 
the company s decision was taken after a review of the company s return on capital requirements indicated that the customer s programs were not generating sufficient returns and  at the same time  were utilizing a disproportionate amount of working capital 
nevertheless  we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue 
in addition to having a limited number of customers  we manufacture a limited number of products for each of our customers 
if we lose any of our largest customers or any product line manufactured for one of our largest customers  we could experience a significant reduction in our revenue 
also  the insolvency of one or more of our largest customers or the inability of one or more of our largest customers to pay for its orders could decrease revenue 
as many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in net revenue can decrease our profit margins and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our industry is very competitive and we may not be successful if we fail to compete effectively 
the electronics manufacturing services ems industry is highly competitive 
we compete against numerous domestic and foreign ems providers including celestica inc  flextronics international ltd  jabil circuit  inc  sanmina sci  inc  solectron corporation  benchmark and plexus 
in addition  we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronics manufacturers that are selling  or may begin to sell  electronics manufacturing services 
many of our competitors have international operations  and some may have substantially greater manufacturing  financial research and development and marketing resources and lower cost structures than we do 
we also face competition from the manufacturing operations of current and potential customers  which are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally versus the advantages of using external manufacturers 
we may experience variability in our operating results  which could negatively impact the price of our shares 
our annual and quarterly results have fluctuated in the past 
the reasons for these fluctuations may similarly affect us in the future 
historically  our calendar fourth quarter revenue has been highest and our calendar first quarter revenue has been lowest 
prospective investors should not rely on results of operations in any past period to indicate what our results will be for any future period 
our operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  including variations in the timing and volume of customer orders relative to our manufacturing capacity  variations in the timing of shipments of products to customers  introduction and market acceptance of our customers new products  changes in demand for our customers existing products  the accuracy of our customers forecasts of future production requirements  effectiveness in managing our manufacturing processes and inventory levels  changes in competitive and economic conditions generally or in our customers markets  changes in the cost or availability of components or skilled labor  and the timing of  and the price we pay for  acquisitions and related integration costs 
in addition  most of our customers typically do not commit to firm production schedules more than to days in advance 
accordingly  we cannot forecast the level of customer orders with certainty 
this makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
in the past  we have been required to increase staffing  purchase materials and incur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers 
sometimes anticipated orders from certain customers have failed to materialize  and sometimes delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in a customer s business needs 
any material delay  cancellation or reduction of orders from our largest customers could cause our revenue to decline significantly 
in addition  as many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand can decrease our gross margins and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on other occasions  customers have required rapid and unexpected increases in production  which have placed burdens on our manufacturing capacity 
any of these factors or a combination of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent upon the electronics industry  which produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles 
substantially all of our customers are in the electronics industry  which is characterized by intense competition  short product life cycles and significant fluctuations in product demand 
in addition  the electronics industry is generally subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
if our customers are unable to create products that keep pace with the changing technological environment  their products could become obsolete and the demand for our services could significantly decline 
our success is largely dependent on the success achieved by our customers in developing and marketing their products 
furthermore  this industry is subject to economic cycles and has in the past experienced downturns 
a continued recession or a downturn in the electronics industry would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
shortage or price fluctuation in component parts specified by our customers could delay product shipment and affect our profitability 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing 
in turnkey manufacturing  we provide both the materials and the manufacturing services 
if we fail to manage our inventory effectively  we may bear the risk of fluctuations in materials costs  scrap and excess inventory  all of which can have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are required to forecast our future inventory needs based upon the anticipated demands of our customers 
inaccuracies in making these forecasts or estimates could result in a shortage or an excess of materials 
in addition  delays  cancellations or reductions of orders by our customers could result in an excess of materials 
a shortage of materials could lengthen production schedules and increase costs 
an excess of materials may increase the costs of maintaining inventory and may increase the risk of inventory obsolescence  both of which may increase expenses and decrease profit margins and operating income 
many of the products we manufacture require one or more components that we order from sole source suppliers 
supply shortages for a particular component can delay productions of all products using that component or cause cost increases in the services we provide 
in addition  in the past  some of the materials we use  such as memory and logic devices  have been subject to industry wide shortages 
as a result  suppliers have been forced to allocate available quantities among their customers and we have not been able to obtain all of the materials desired 
our inability to obtain these needed materials could slow production or assembly  delay shipments to our customers  increase costs and reduce operating income 
also  we may bear the risk of periodic component price increases 
accordingly  some component price increases could increase costs and reduce operating income 
also we rely on a variety of common carriers for materials transportation  and we route materials through various world ports 
a work stoppage  strike or shutdown of a major port or airport could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or expediting charges  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have experienced significant growth and significant retrenchment in a short period of time 
since  we have completed seven acquisitions 
acquisitions may involve numerous risks  including difficulty in integrating operations  technologies  systems  and products and services of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention and disruption of operations  increased expenses and working capital requirements  entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired companies 
in addition  acquisitions may involve financial risks  such as the potential liabilities of the acquired businesses  the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the financial impact of transaction expenses and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any transactions that are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and possible adverse tax and accounting effects 
in we implemented a restructuring plan that called for significant retrenchment 
we closed our denver and haverhill facilities and resized operations in mexico and ireland in an effort to reduce our cost structure 
in february  the main customer of our cork  ireland facility was placed into administration as part of a financial restructuring 
as a result  on march   we announced that we were closing our cork  ireland facility and that we were taking steps to place the subsidiary that operates that facility in voluntary administration 
during the third quarter of  the company took further steps to realign its cost structure and plant capacity 
we have also determined to close our interconnect facility in donegal  ireland and our site in austin  texas 
we expect to cease operations at those sites during the first and second quarters of retrenchment has caused  and is expected to continue to cause  strain on our infrastructure  including our managerial  technical and other resources 
we may experience inefficiencies as we integrate operations from closed facilities to currently operating facilities and may experience delays in meeting the needs of transferred customers 
in addition  we are reducing the geographic dispersion of our operations  which may make it harder for us to compete and may cause us to lose customers 
the loss of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a limited history of owning and operating our acquired businesses on a consolidated basis 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet performance expectations or successfully integrate our acquired businesses on a timely basis without disrupting the quality and reliability of service to our customers or diverting management resources 
our rapid growth and subsequent retrenchment has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on management  on our financial resources  and on our information  operating and financial systems 
if we are unable to manage effectively  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to respond to rapidly changing technology and process development  we may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development 
the future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  to develop and market products and services that meet changing customer needs  and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
in addition  the ems industry could in the future encounter competition from new or revised technologies that render existing technology less competitive or obsolete or that reduce the demand for our services 
there can be no assurance that we will effectively respond to the technological requirements of the changing market 
to the extent we determine that new technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the development  acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment may require us to make significant capital investments 
there can be no assurance that capital will be available for these purposes in the future or that investments in new technologies will result in commercially viable technological processes 
our business will suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and skilled employees 
our business depends on our ability to continue to recruit  train and retain skilled employees  particularly executive management  engineering and sales personnel 
recruiting personnel in our industry is highly competitive 
in addition  our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to retain key management and existing employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract qualified management in the future 
in connection with our restructuring  we significantly reduced our workforce 
if we receive a significant volume of new orders  we may have difficulty recruiting skilled workers back into our workforce to respond to such orders and accordingly may experience delays that could adversely effect our ability to meet customers delivery schedules 
risks particular to our international operations could adversely affect our overall results 
revenue generated outside of the united states and canada was approximately in international operations are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in the value of currencies and high levels of inflation  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting amounts receivable  unexpected changes in and the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws  political and economic instability  increases in duties and taxation  imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds  trade restrictions  and dependence on key customers 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws  which expose us to potential financial liability 
our operations are regulated under a number of federal  state  provincial  local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations  which govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling  storage and disposal of such materials 
compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us because we use metals and other hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes 
we may be liable under environmental laws for the cost of cleaning up properties we own or operate if they are or become contaminated by the release of hazardous materials  regardless of whether we caused such release 
in addition we  along with any other person who arranges for the disposal of our wastes  may be liable for costs associated with an investigation and remediation of sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes  if such sites become contaminated  even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws 
in the event of a contamination or violation of environmental laws  we could be held liable for damages including fines  penalties and the costs of remedial actions and could also be subject to revocation of our discharge permits 
any such revocations could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities  thereby having a material adverse effect on our operations 
environmental laws could also become more stringent over time  imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our capital structure our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
at december   we had million of indebtedness under our senior credit facility 
this debt could have adverse consequences for our business  including we will be more vulnerable to adverse general economic conditions  we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  we may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes  we may have limited flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  we could be limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in our credit arrangements in our borrowing of additional funds  and we may fail to comply with the covenants under which we borrowed our indebtedness which could result in an event of default 
if an event of default occurs and is not cured or waived  it could result in all amounts outstanding  together with accrued interest  becoming immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay such amounts  the lenders could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
during the fourth quarter of  we were in violation of certain covenants contained in our credit agreement 
such violation was waived and the credit agreement was amended to provide financial covenants through june consistent with our current revenues and our forecast 
however  there can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement 
there can be no assurance that our leverage and such restrictions will not materially adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
in addition  our ability to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness to meet our financial and restrictive covenants and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond our control  as well as the availability of revolving credit borrowings under our senior credit facility or successor facilities 
the terms of our credit agreement impose significant restrictions on our ability to operate 
the terms of our current credit agreement restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  complete acquisitions  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  consummate certain asset sales  make capital expenditures  incur cash restructuring costs  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  merge  consolidate or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
we are also required to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain monthly and quarterly financial condition tests  which further restrict our ability to operate as we choose 
during the fourth quarter of  we were in violation of certain covenants contained in our credit agreement 
such violation was waived and the credit agreement was amended to provide financial covenants through june consistent with our current revenues and our forecast for as a result of our non compliance  customers may lose confidence in us and reduce or eliminate their orders with us which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries are pledged as security under our senior credit facility 
institutional investors and certain members of management have significant influence over our business  and could delay  deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination 
certain of our institutional investors have representatives on our board of directors  including investment funds affiliated with bain capital  llc and investment funds affiliated with celerity partners 
further  certain members of our management  who are also stockholders of smtc  serve on our board 
by virtue of such stock ownership and board representation  certain of our institutional investors and certain members of management have a significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders  including the election of our directors  and exercise significant control over our business policies and affairs 
such concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our charter documents and state law may make it harder for others to obtain control of us even though some stockholders might consider such a development favorable 
provisions in our charter  by laws and certain provisions under delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management that stockholders consider favorable or beneficial 
if a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented  the market price of our shares could suffer 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our senior credit facility bears interest at a floating rate 
the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facility for the year ended december  was 
our debt of million bore interest at on december  based on the us base rate 
if the us base rate increased by  our interest rate would have risen to and our interest expense would have increased by approximately million for fiscal year foreign currency exchange risk most of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars  and as a result we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made
