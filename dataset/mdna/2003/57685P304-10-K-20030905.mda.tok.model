by unifying and streamlining processes across the product lifecycle  companies can easily work on projects with parties inside and outside of their enterprises to achieve greater efficiency and profitability 
in addition  our technology enables companies to adapt  react and scale quickly to address their ever changing business requirements 
our collaborative plm solutions are based on our suite of software products  collectively referred to as matrix our matrix solution is a comprehensive and flexible plm environment that consists of four components the matrix plm platform  collaborative applications  lifecycle applications and enterprise interoperability products 
software license revenues from our suite of software products and the number of software license transactions for fiscal  and are set forth below year ended in millions  except transaction volumes june  june  june  matrix plm platform collaborative applications and lifecycle applications enterprise interoperability products number of software license transactions 
table of contents we offer a variety of services that complement our plm software 
our professional services personnel provide rapid and cost effective implementation  integration and other consulting services 
these personnel capture and model the specific business processes that reflect our customers planning  design  manufacturing  sales and service practices 
we also provide training and maintenance and customer support services to continuously enhance the value of our products to our customers 
in addition  we have a global network of systems integrators who are experienced in providing implementation and integration services to our customers 
many of our customers use their preferred systems integrators or perform their own implementation 
we generate revenues from licensing our software and providing professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services through our offices in the united states  canada  england  france  germany  italy  japan  korea  singapore  taiwan and the netherlands and indirectly through our alliance partner network throughout europe and asia pacific 
revenues by geographic region fluctuate each period based on the timing  size and number of software license and professional services transactions  and we expect revenues by geographic region to continue to fluctuate each period 
our revenues by major geographical region  including exports into such regions  for fiscal  and were as follows year ended in millions june  june  june  north america europe asia pacific our international subsidiaries generally invoice their customers in local currency 
therefore  our revenue  when stated in us dollars  is subject to foreign currency risk 
we currently do not enter into contracts or agreements to minimize our exposure to the effects of changes in foreign currency on our revenues 
accordingly  if the dollar weakens relative to foreign currencies  our revenues would increase when stated in us dollars 
conversely  if the dollar strengthens  our revenues would decrease 
if our revenues for fiscal had been translated at exchange rates for the comparable period a year ago  our revenues would have been million lower 
although we license our software and provide services to numerous customers  a single customer may represent more than of our quarterly or annual total revenues 
no one customer accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal or during fiscal  one customer represented approximately of our revenues 
we expect that revenues from large orders will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total revenues in future quarters 

table of contents as a result of weakness in information technology spending and global economic conditions and the related impact on our business  in october  october and april we implemented restructuring programs to reduce our expenses to align our operations and cost structure with current and projected market conditions and our strategic initiatives 
these restructuring programs primarily consisted of a reduction in the number of employees across all functions and locations  a significant reduction in the use of independent contractors across all functions and locations and the closure of excess facilities 
as a result of our restructuring programs and other cost saving initiatives  we have reduced our number of employees from as of september  to as of june  we will continue to evaluate current and projected market conditions in order to better align our operations and cost structure with these conditions  and we may in the future take certain actions that result in additional charges and expenses 
we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology and products  market  license  sell  implement and support our products and services  and maintain an infrastructure to support our global operations 
these costs have historically exceeded our total revenues 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we currently expect to incur net losses in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments  which we evaluate on an on going basis  that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following sets forth the most important accounting policies we used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and those that affect our more significant estimates and judgments  which have been reviewed by our disclosure committee  consisting primarily of our senior management team  and the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from licensing our software and providing professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services 
we execute separate contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each software license and maintenance arrangement and each professional services arrangement 
these contracts may be an element in a multiple element arrangement 
revenues under multiple element arrangements  which may include several different software products or services sold together  are allocated to each element using the residual method 
we use the residual method when fair value does not exist for one of the delivered elements in an arrangement 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized 
we have established sufficient vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
accordingly  software license revenue is recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with professional services  training or maintenance and customer support services 

table of contents we recognize software license revenues upon execution of a signed license agreement  delivery of the software to a customer and determination that collection of a fixed license fee is probable 
for delivery over the internet  the software license is considered delivered when the customer is provided access to the software files 
in accordance with our agreements with our value added resellers and distributors alliance partners  an alliance partner has the right to license our software to its customers end users 
therefore  we have no obligation to the alliance partner s end users 
accordingly  we recognize software license revenues from an alliance partner upon receipt of a written confirmation from the alliance partner of a noncancellable  binding written arrangement with the ultimate end user and delivery of the software to the alliance partner 
we recognize revenue from software subscription arrangements ratably over the term of the contract on a straight line basis 
fees from revenue sharing  royalty and subscriber arrangements with and through third parties are recognized as revenue when they are fixed and determinable  generally upon receipt of a statement from the third party 
service revenues include professional services  reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  training and maintenance and customer support fees 
professional services are not essential to the functionality of the other elements in an arrangement and are accounted for separately 
professional services revenues are primarily derived from time and material contracts and are recognized as the services are performed 
professional services revenues for fixed price contracts are recognized using a concept of proportional performance based upon the ratio of direct labor costs to expected labor costs 
if conditions for acceptance are required  professional services revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance 
our customers generally reimburse us for the majority of our out of pocket expenses incurred during the course of an engagement 
we do not mark up or add additional fees to the actual out of pocket expenses we incur 
training revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
for arrangements that include the licensing of software and the performance of professional services under a fixed price contract  both the software license revenues and professional services revenues are recognized using a concept of proportional performance based upon the ratio of direct labor costs to expected labor costs 
maintenance and customer support fees include the right to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis and ongoing technical support 
maintenance and customer support fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  generally one year  on a straight line basis 
when a maintenance and customer support fee is included with a software license fee  we allocate a portion of the software license fee to maintenance and customer support fees based on the renewal rate of maintenance and customer support fees 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically assess the collectibility of customer accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from uncollectible customer accounts receivable 
in estimating this allowance  we consider customer specific factors such as historical collection experience  current credit worthiness  the aggregate amount due  age of the receivable and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
we also consider factors such as the overall balance and aging of our accounts receivable  as well as customer and geographic concentrations 
actual customer collections could differ materially from our estimates 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce a materially different allowance 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at june  
table of contents prepaid software royalty fees prepaid software royalty fees  which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets  are paid to third party software developers under contractual arrangements for technology integrated into certain of our collaborative applications  lifecycle applications and enterprise interoperability products 
amortization of prepaid software royalty fees commences when the software is available for general release 
we amortize prepaid software royalty fees to cost of software license revenues based on the greater of the actual royalties incurred to date or the straight line method of amortization over the estimated useful life of the software product  which is generally two or three years 
management regularly reviews the valuation of each prepaid software royalty fee in order to determine if events and circumstances may require a change in such valuation to reflect the estimated recoverable amount 
a reduction in the license or discontinuation of software for which we have prepaid royalty fees may result in additional charges to cost of software license revenues 
prepaid software royalty fees aggregated million at june  property and equipment we estimate the useful lives of our property and equipment  and we record depreciation on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment 
we regularly review our estimate of the useful lives and net book value of our property and equipment in order to determine if events and circumstances  such as changes in technology  product obsolescence and changes in our business  may require a change in the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment or recognition of an impairment loss  both of which would increase our operating expenses 
for additional information regarding the composition and value of our property and equipment and the related estimated useful lives  refer to notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
accounting for income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the estimated amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
during our assessment of the valuation allowance  we consider future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies on a consolidated basis and in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the fact it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we regularly evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and may adjust the valuation allowance based on such analysis 
for additional information regarding the composition and value of our deferred tax assets  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item in this annual report on form k 
software license and professional services warranty we generally provide a day warranty on our software products and professional services 
our software products are generally warranted to be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and the products are also generally warranted to substantially perform as described in the applicable software product documentation 
to date  our software product warranty expense has not been material 
our professional services are generally warranted to be performed in a professional manner and to materially conform to the specifications set forth in our standard professional services contracts 
in the event the customer requests the work be corrected or additional work be performed  we generally will provide additional professional services at no charge to comply with our warranty obligations to ensure customer satisfaction 

table of contents we provide for an estimate of professional services warranty based on historical activity 
warranty expense is included in cost of services 
if our actual warranty activities differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and result in additional charges to cost of services 
we primarily satisfy our warrant obligations by providing in kind services 
our warranty accrual was million at june  for additional information regarding the activity related to our warranty accrual  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item in this annual report on form k

we derive our software license revenues principally from licensing our suite of software products including our matrix plm platform  collaborative applications  lifecycle applications and enterprise interoperability products 
software license revenues decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to the continued weakness in information technology spending around the world 
as a result  the total number of software license transactions decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal  and the number of software license transactions in excess of million decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal software license revenues also decreased due to a significant decrease in software license revenues in europe 

table of contents software license revenues in europe decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to weakness in information technology spending in europe and poor sales execution  especially during the three months ended march  software license revenues in north america decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  while software license revenues in asia pacific increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal software license revenues from our collaborative applications and lifecycle applications increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a result of our customers expanding their existing implementations to include these new products and new customers including them in their initial purchases 
software license revenues from our matrix plm platform and enterprise interoperability products decreased million and million  respectively  over the same period primarily due to a reduction in software license revenues from new customers 
we expect software license revenues from our collaborative applications and lifecycle applications to increase and represent a greater proportion of our software license revenues 
service revenues 
we provide services to our customers and systems integrators consisting of professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services 
our service revenues also include reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
our professional services  which include implementation and consulting services  are primarily provided on a time and materials basis 
typically  our customers reimburse us for the majority of our out of pocket expenses incurred during the course of an engagement 
we do not mark up or add additional fees to the actual out of pocket expenses we incur 
we also offer training services to our customers  distributors and systems integrators either in our offices throughout the world or at customer locations 
customers that license our products generally purchase annually renewable maintenance contracts  which provide customers with the right to receive unspecified software upgrades and technical support over the term of the contract 
service revenues decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in professional services revenues as a result of a decrease in the number and scope of professional services engagements due to continued weakness in information technology spending  an increase in the proportion of professional services engagements led by systems integrators and a delay in our ability to recognize professional services revenue from a customer due to uncertainty of collecting the fees from the customer 
the decrease in service revenues also resulted from a decrease in reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred of million due to a decrease in the number and scope of professional services engagements and a million decrease in training revenues due to fewer software license transactions with new customers 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in maintenance revenues from new and renewed maintenance contracts 
maintenance revenues represented and of service revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cost of software licenses 
cost of software licenses primarily consists of royalties paid to third parties for certain collaborative applications  lifecycle applications and enterprise interoperability products licensed to our customers 
cost of software licenses also includes the cost of manuals and product documentation  production media used to deliver our products and shipping costs 
our cost of software licenses fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of software licensed  the extent to which we pay royalties to third parties on collaborative applications  lifecycle applications and enterprise interoperability products and the amount of amortization of prepaid software royalty fees 
cost of software licenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in cost of software licenses was primarily due to lower royalties as a result of a decrease in the licensing of enterprise interoperability software 

table of contents cost of services 
cost of services includes salaries and related expenses for internal services personnel and costs of contracting with independent systems integrators to provide consulting services 
cost of services fluctuates based on the mix of internal professional services personnel and more expensive independent systems integrators used for professional services engagements 
our gross margins may fluctuate based on the actual costs incurred to provide professional services 
cost of services decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to a million decrease in independent systems integrator costs and lower travel and other operating expenses as a result of our cost saving initiatives 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of total revenues  or gross margin  increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to an increase in the relative proportion of our service revenues derived from maintenance and improvement in the gross margin on professional services revenues 
gross margin on software licenses decreased slightly to for fiscal from for fiscal due to an increase in the relative proportion of third party collaborative application and lifecycle application software licensed 
gross margin on services increased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily due to an increase in the proportion of our services revenues derived from maintenance  an increase in the productivity of our professional services organization and a decrease in independent systems integrator costs 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses include marketing costs  such as public relations and advertising  trade shows  marketing materials and customer user group meetings  and selling costs such as sales training events and commissions 
selling and marketing costs may fluctuate based on the timing of trade shows and user group events and the amount of sales commissions  which vary based upon revenues 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to a million decrease in personnel  personnel recruiting and training  and travel costs as a result of our restructuring programs and cost saving initiatives and a million decrease in fees for contractors  consultants and outside services due to our cost saving initiatives  slightly offset by higher commission expense 
selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily due to the factors previously discussed 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs incurred to develop our intellectual property and are charged to expense as incurred 
to date  software development costs have been charged to expense as incurred because the costs incurred from the attainment of technological feasibility to general product release have not been significant 
research and development costs may fluctuate based on the use of third parties to develop specific collaborative applications  lifecycle applications and enterprise interoperability products and utilization of domestic and foreign third party contractors  which are generally more expensive than our internal engineering personnel 
research and development expenses decreased slightly by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to a lower revenues base 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation of executive  finance  investor relations  human resource and administrative personnel  legal and accounting services and provisions for doubtful accounts 

table of contents general and administrative expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to a million decrease in personnel  personnel recruiting and training  and travel costs as a result of our restructuring programs and cost saving initiatives and a million reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts due to lower levels of accounts receivable and revenues 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to the factors previously discussed 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation relates to the issuance of stock options to employees with exercise prices below the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in connection with certain stock option grants during fiscal and  we recorded deferred stock based compensation totaling approximately million 
deferred stock based compensation represents the difference between the option exercise price and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date of the option grant and is reported as deferred stock based consideration  a component of stockholders equity 
deferred stock based compensation is amortized through charges to operations over the vesting period of the options  which is generally four years 
stock based compensation decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to the cancellation of stock options from terminated employees primarily related to our restructuring programs 
we expect to record stock based compensation of million in fiscal  and we expect that the amortization of deferred stock based compensation will end during our third fiscal quarter ending april  restructuring charges 
as discussed in the comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and june   in october we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our expenses 
october restructuring program as a result of continued weakness in information technology spending and global economic conditions and the related impact on our business  in october we implemented another restructuring program to further reduce expenses to align our operations and cost structure with current and projected market conditions the october restructuring program 
this restructuring program primarily included a reduction in the number of employees across all functions and locations  a reduction in the use of independent contractors across all functions and locations and the closure of excess facilities 
the october restructuring program included a reduction in workforce of employees  consisting of employees in cost of service revenues  employees in selling and marketing  employees in research and development and nine employees in general and administration 
the costs related to the reduction in workforce include severance  fringe benefits and other related costs 
the october restructuring program also included facility and lease costs related to the closure of certain excess facilities that we have exited and the termination of certain automotive lease contracts 
during the three months ended june   we recorded an adjustment of million to the restructuring charge related to the october restructuring program as a result of the favorable settlement of certain employee severance and lease arrangements and lower than anticipated fringe benefit costs 

table of contents the significant components of the october restructuring program and the related charges  non cash adjustments  cash payments and the remaining accrual as of june  were as follows in millions employee severance and fringe benefits facilities and leases total restructuring charges non cash adjustments adjusted restructuring charges cash payments accrual balance as of june  the october restructuring program was substantially completed during fiscal  and the remaining cash payments are expected to be made through december  april restructuring program in april  we reorganized certain of our operations to further reduce expenses and to better align our management structure with our strategic initiatives the april restructuring program

other income expense fluctuates based on interest income earned on our investments and the amount of cash available for investment  interest expense related to borrowings under our credit facilities  realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and gains and losses on sales and disposals of fixed assets 
other income decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in interest income from lower yields on our investments resulting from a significant decrease in market interest rates and lower levels of cash available for investment  offset by a slight decrease in other expense  which included losses on disposals 
table of contents of fixed assets in fiscal we expect our interest income to continue to decrease in fiscal due to the recent decreases in market interest rates and lower levels of cash available for investment 
provision for income taxes 
in fiscal  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million related to minimum taxes due in certain domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions 
no provision for income taxes was recorded for fiscal due to our accumulated net losses 
comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and june  software license revenues 
software license revenues decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the weakening of the global economy and a decrease in information technology spending 
in addition  new customers are starting new information technology projects with smaller initial software license investments 
accordingly  the average deal size of our software license transactions decreased and software licensed to new customers decreased during fiscal software license revenues decreased million in north america  million in europe and million in asia pacific due to the factors previously discussed 
service revenues 
service revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to an million increase in maintenance revenues from new and renewed maintenance contracts and a million increase in professional services revenues from implementation and consulting projects for new customers and continuation or expansion of implementation and consulting projects for existing customers 
during fiscal  there was also an increase in the average number of professional services employees providing billable implementation and consulting services and an increase in the billable utilization of our professional services personnel 
maintenance revenues represented and of service revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively

cost of services increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to a million increase in internal services personnel costs due to an increase in the average number of services personnel employed during the year  a million increase in consulting and contractor costs due to an increase in the use of independent systems integrators  and an increase in rent  depreciation and other costs 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of total revenues  or gross margin  decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to a decrease in higher margin software license revenues and an increase in the relative proportion of our total revenues derived from lower margin service revenues 
gross margin on software licenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily due to an increase in the relative proportion of third party collaborative application and lifecycle application software licensed  which are subject to royalties 
during fiscal  we adopted the provisions of eitf no 
relating to the accounting for reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
accordingly  our service revenues include reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which had been previously reported as a reduction to cost of services to offset the costs incurred 
this reclassification of out of 
table of contents pocket expenses incurred did not affect the amount of our gross profit but did decrease our gross margin 
gross margin on services increased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenues 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to an million decrease in commission and other compensation expenses due to lower software license revenues  offset by a slight increase in personnel and related costs 
selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased slightly to for fiscal from for fiscal due to a lower revenues base 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to a million increase in personnel costs due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel  a million increase in outsourced translation services and an increase in rent  depreciation and other costs

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to the factors previously discussed and a lower revenues base 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense reflects lower amortization due to cancellation of stock options upon employee terminations 
restructuring charges 
october restructuring program as a result of unfavorable global economic conditions and a reduction in information technology spending around the world and the related impact on our business  in october we implemented a restructuring program to reduce expenses to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions the october restructuring program 
the october restructuring program included a reduction in the number of employees across all functions and locations  a reduction in the use of independent contractors across all functions and locations  termination of certain contracts and closure of excess facilities 
the october restructuring program included a reduction in workforce of employees  consisting of employees in cost of service revenues  employees in selling and marketing  employees in research and development and eight employees in general and administration 
the costs related to the reduction in workforce include severance and fringe benefits

provision for income taxes 
no provision for income taxes was recorded for fiscal due to our accumulated net losses 
a provision for income taxes of million was recorded during fiscal based on our estimate of income taxes expected to be due in certain states and foreign countries 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is our current cash and cash equivalents 
our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent upon our ability to generate revenue from licensing our software and providing related services  as well as our ability to manage our operating costs 
a decrease in the demand for our software and related services or unanticipated increases in our operating costs would likely have an adverse effect on our liquidity and cash generated from operations 
the following sets forth information relating to our liquidity in millions  except days june  june  cash and cash equivalents working capital days sales outstanding for the quarter ended days days during fiscal and  our cash and cash equivalents decreased primarily due to our losses from operations and cash payments related to our restructuring programs 
we currently expect to incur losses from operations for fiscal accordingly  we expect our liquidity to continue to decrease through fiscal the decrease in working capital was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents due to our loss from operations and a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of a decrease in revenues and a reduction in the days of sales outstanding as a result of improved collections and billing efficiencies 
we have a million line of credit that bears interest at the bank s prime rate at june  plus per annum on any outstanding balances and expires december  as of june   we had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit and million available 
this line of credit is collateralized by all of our assets and has certain non financial covenants 
we were in compliance with these non financial covenants as of june  net cash used in operating activities for fiscal was million primarily resulting from our net loss  decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and a decrease in deferred revenues due to recognition of certain software license revenue and amortization of maintenance contracts  offset by a decrease in accounts receivable due to lower revenues and a reduction in days of sales outstanding 
net cash used in operating activities for fiscal was million resulting from our net loss and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  due to prepayment of software license fees  and a decrease in accrued expenses  offset by an increase in deferred maintenance revenues and a decrease in accounts receivable due to lower revenues 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  and primarily reflects our investments in computer hardware and software  leasehold improvements and office furniture and equipment 
we expect that capital expenditures for the next months will be approximately million  primarily for the acquisition of computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal and consists of the proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of million and million  respectively  offset by repurchases of common stock of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal and consisted of the proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 

table of contents on january   our board of directors the board approved a stock repurchase program the program whereby we may repurchase up to million of our common stock 
any common stock repurchases under the program may be made over the one year period that began on january  and may be made in the open market  through block trades or otherwise 
depending on market conditions and other factors  these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
during fiscal  we purchased and retired  shares of our common stock under the program for the aggregate cost of million 
repurchases made under the program were and are expected to be funded from available working capital 
on february   we announced that the board approved a voluntary stock option exchange program the option exchange program 
the option exchange program provides eligible holders of outstanding  unexercised options to purchase shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our third amended and restated stock plan the plan and our amended and restated stock plan the plan with an exercise price of at least per share the opportunity to tender such options in exchange for new replacement options currently expected to be issued after september  the ratios of new replacement options to options tendered pursuant to the option exchange program will be as follows for for options with exercise prices of to  for for options with exercise prices of to  and for for options with exercise prices of or more 
members of our board and our executive officers are not eligible to participate in the option exchange program 
the new replacement options will generally have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date the new replacement stock options are granted  vest quarterly over a month period and include a month acceleration provision upon a change in control 
options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock were tendered and cancelled on march  pursuant to the option exchange program 
we expect to grant new replacement options to purchase an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock after september  in exchange for the tendered and cancelled options 
we do not expect the option exchange program to result in any additional compensation charges or variable plan accounting 
we currently anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and available credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds in order to fund an expansion of our business  develop new products  enhance existing products and services  or acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders may be reduced  our stockholders may experience additional dilution  and such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our stockholders 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund an expansion of our business  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or develop or enhance our services or products would be significantly limited 

table of contents commitments and contractual obligations our commitments and contractual obligations primarily consist of operating leases for facilities  automobiles and office equipment  product development agreements under which we pay software license fees to third parties for development or assistance in development of certain collaborative applications  lifecycle applications and enterprise interoperability software and other contractual arrangements to support certain programs or activities 
our commitments and contractual obligations in which we guarantee or set a minimum amount of fees consisted of the following as of june  fiscal year in millions thereafter leases development agreements other contractual arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  other commitments or contractual obligations in addition to those set forth above and those included in our consolidated financial statements as of june  recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 

fin addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of certain variable interest entities  as defined in fin fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim period beginning after june  as of june   we did not have any interest in a variable interest entity 
accordingly  the adoption of fin is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes as of june   we had available us federal and state net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million and approximately million of available us federal and state tax credits to reduce future us income taxes 
these nols include deductions of approximately million related to certain stock option exercises 
the tax benefit from the nols related to the exercise of stock options will be recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital as these nols are utilized 
the nols and tax credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts commencing in fiscal through fiscal  if not utilized 
use of these nols and tax credits may be limited due to certain changes in ownership 

table of contents as of june   we also had nol carryforwards in certain foreign countries aggregating million that are also subject to certain limitations 
these nols include deductions of approximately million related to certain stock option exercises 
the tax benefit from the nols related to the exercise of stock options will be recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital as these nols are utilized 
these nols expire in varying amounts commencing in fiscal  if not utilized 
we do not provide us taxes on our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings as they are deemed to be permanently reinvested outside the us upon repatriation  we will provide the appropriate us income taxes on these earnings 
because of the uncertainty regarding our ability to use our united states and foreign nols and tax credit carryforwards  we have provided a full valuation allowance on these and all other deferred tax assets as of june cautionary statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in the following cautionary statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
if any of the following risks were to occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would decline 
any forward looking statements should be considered in light of the factors discussed below 
we have a history of losses  expect to incur losses in the future and may not achieve or maintain profitability we have incurred substantial net losses in the past  and we expect to incur net losses in future periods 
we incurred net losses of approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we will need to generate significant increases in revenues to achieve and maintain profitability  and we may not be able to do so 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate or decline or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenues  our business will be significantly and adversely affected 
although we implemented restructuring programs in fiscal and fiscal to better align our operations and cost structure with market conditions  these programs may not be sufficient for us to achieve profitability in any future period 
even if we achieve profitability in the future on a quarterly or annual basis  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability 
failure to achieve profitability or achieve and sustain the level of profitability expected by investors and securities analysts may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the weak computer software and services market and worldwide economic conditions may result in decreased revenues and operating losses the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for computer software and services  particularly in the market segments in which we compete 
a continued softening of demand for computer software and services caused by the current weak global economy may result in decreased revenues and operating losses 
in this weak economy  we may not be able to effectively maintain existing levels of software and service revenues  promote future growth in our software and services revenues or achieve profitability 

table of contents our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of management  securities analysts or investors  our stock price could decline our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict  have varied significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
we typically realize a significant percentage of our revenues for a fiscal quarter in the second half of the third month of the quarter 
accordingly  our quarterly results may be difficult or impossible to predict prior to the end of the quarter 
any inability to obtain sufficient orders or to fulfill shipments in the period immediately preceding the end of any particular quarter may cause the results for that quarter to fall short of our revenues targets 
any disruption in our ability to conduct our business which occurs will likely have a material adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  we base our current and future expense levels in part on our estimates of future revenues 
our expenses are largely fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly if our revenues fall short of our expectations 
accordingly  a shortfall in revenues in a particular quarter would have an adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate for many reasons  including  without limitation changes in demand for our products and services  including seasonal differences  changes in the mix of our software license and service revenues  changes in the mix of the licensing of our matrix plm platform  collaborative applications  lifecycle applications and enterprise interoperability products  the amount of royalty payments due to third parties on our collaborative applications  lifecycle applications and enterprise interoperability software products  changes in the mix of domestic and international revenues  variability in the mix of professional services performed by us and systems integrators  and the amount of training we provide to systems integrators and alliance partners related to our products and their implementation 
for these reasons  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our financial results to forecast our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if a shortfall in revenues occurs  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 

table of contents our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict when or if sales will occur and therefore we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues our products have a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our operating results 
customers view the purchase of our software as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  customers generally evaluate our software products and determine their impact on existing infrastructure over a lengthy period of time 
our sales cycle has historically ranged from approximately one to nine months based on the customer s need to rapidly implement a solution and whether the customer is new or is extending an existing implementation 
the license of our software products may be subject to delays if the customer has lengthy internal budgeting  approval and evaluation processes 
we may incur significant selling and marketing expenses during a customer s evaluation period  including the costs of developing a full proposal and completing a rapid proof of concept or custom demonstration  before the customer places an order with us 
customers may also initially purchase a limited number of licenses before expanding their implementations 
larger customers may purchase our software products as part of multiple simultaneous purchasing decisions  which may result in additional unplanned administrative processing and other delays in the recognition of our license revenues 
if revenues forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized or are delayed to another quarter  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues  which could significantly and adversely affect our operating results 
we may not achieve our anticipated revenues if large software and service orders expected in a quarter are not placed or are delayed although we license our software to numerous customers in any quarter  a single customer often represents more than of our quarterly revenues 
we expect that revenues from large orders will continue to represent a large percentage of our total revenues in future quarters 
a customer may determine to increase its number of licenses and expand its implementation of our software throughout its organization and to its customers  suppliers and other business partners only after a successful initial implementation 
therefore  the timing of these large orders is often unpredictable 
if any large order anticipated for a particular quarter is not realized  delayed to another quarter or significantly reduced  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues  which could significantly and adversely affect our operating results 
if our existing customers do not license additional software products from us  we may not achieve growth in our revenues our customers initial implementations of our software often include a limited number of licenses 
customers may subsequently add licenses as they expand the implementations of our products throughout their enterprises or add software applications designed for specific functions 
therefore  it is important that our customers are satisfied with their initial product implementations 
if we do not increase licenses to existing customers  we may not be able to achieve growth in our revenues 

table of contents our restructuring programs may not achieve our desired results and we may therefore continue to incur operating losses we implemented restructuring programs in fiscal and fiscal the primary objective of our restructuring programs has been to reduce our operating expenses in order to align our operations and cost structure with market conditions and strategic initiatives 
these programs included reductions in our workforce  reductions in the use of independent contractors  closure of certain facilities and termination of certain contracts 
these workforce reductions could impact the productivity of our remaining employees  including those directly responsible for sales and services  which may negatively affect our future revenues 
in addition  the failure to retain and effectively manage our remaining employees could increase our costs and negatively affect our sales and services operations and our ability to attain revenue goals 
failure to achieve the desired results of our restructuring programs could result in reduced revenues and continued operating losses 
the market for our plm software is newly emerging and rapidly changing and demand for plm software may not evolve and could decline the market for plm software is rapidly changing 
we cannot be certain that this market will continue to develop and grow or that companies will choose to use our products rather than attempting to develop alternative platforms and applications internally or through other sources 
if we fail to establish a significant base of customer references  our ability to market and license our products successfully may be reduced 
companies that have already invested substantial resources in other methods of sharing information during the design  manufacturing and supply process may be reluctant to adopt new technology or infrastructures that may replace  limit or compete with their existing systems or methods 
we expect that we will continue to need to pursue intensive marketing and selling efforts to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our products 
therefore  demand for and market acceptance of our software products is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
if we are not successful in developing new products and services that keep pace with technology  our operating results will suffer the market for our software is characterized by rapid technological advances  changing customer needs and evolving industry standards 
accordingly  to realize our expectations regarding our operating results  we depend on our ability to develop  in a timely manner  new software products and services that keep pace with developments in technology  meet evolving customer requirements  and enhance our current product and service offerings and deliver those products and services through appropriate distribution channels 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  either enhancements to our products or new products that respond to technological advances and satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer needs 
if we fail to introduce new products  our operating results will suffer 
in addition  if new industry standards emerge that we do not anticipate or adapt to  our software products could be rendered obsolete and our business could be materially harmed 

table of contents we may not achieve anticipated revenues if market acceptance of our software does not continue we believe that revenues from licenses of our software  together with revenues from related professional services  training and maintenance and customer support services  will account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our future financial performance will depend on market acceptance of our software  including matrix and our collaborative applications  lifecycle applications and enterprise interoperability products  and any upgrades or enhancements that we may make to our products in the future 
as a result  if our software does not achieve and maintain widespread market acceptance  we may not achieve anticipated revenues 
in addition  if our competitors release new products that are superior to our software  demand for our products may not accelerate and could decline 
if we are unable to increase the number and scope of our collaborative applications  lifecycle applications and enterprise interoperability products or ship or implement any upgrades or enhancements to our products when planned  or if the introduction of upgrades or enhancements causes customers to defer orders for our existing products  we also may not achieve anticipated revenues 
our future success is uncertain because we have significantly changed our product line we shipped the first collaborative application in october our strategy is to develop new collaborative applications and lifecycle applications for use in product lifecycle management and to combine them with our matrix plm platform and enterprise interoperability products to create plm solutions 
our new business focus and strategy may not be successful 
in addition  because we have only recently begun to focus our business on the development  license and marketing of our collaborative applications and lifecycle application software and plm solutions  we may have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
we face the many challenges  risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies transitioning to a new product line and using a new business strategy in a rapidly evolving market 
if we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy  our operating results will suffer 
we will not succeed unless we can compete in our markets the markets in which we offer our software and services are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
furthermore  we expect competition to intensify  given the newly emerging nature of the market for plm software and consolidation in the software industry in general 
we will not succeed if we cannot compete effectively in these markets 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer 
many of our actual or potential competitors have significant advantages over us  including  without limitation larger and more established selling and marketing capabilities  significantly greater financial  engineering and other resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers  and well established relationships with our existing and potential customers  systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and alliance partners 
as a result  our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services than we can 
accordingly  we may not be able to maintain or expand our revenues if competition increases and we are unable to respond effectively 

table of contents as competition in the plm software market intensifies  new solutions will come to market 
our competitors may package their products in a manner that may discourage customers from licensing our software 
also  current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties or adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
consolidation in the industry also results in larger competitors that may have significant combined resources with which to compete against us 
increased competition could result in reductions in price and revenues  lower profit margins  loss of customers and loss of market share 
any one of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
our revenues could decline if we do not develop and maintain successful relationships with systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and alliance partners we pursue business alliances with systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and alliance partners to endorse our software  implement our software  provide customer support services  promote and resell products that integrate with our products and develop industry specific software products 
these alliances provide an opportunity to license our products to our alliance partners installed customer bases 
in many cases  these parties have established relationships with our existing and potential customers and can influence the decisions of these customers 
we rely upon these companies for recommendations of our products during the evaluation stage of the purchasing process  as well as for implementation and customer support services 
a number of our competitors have strong relationships with these systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and alliance partners who  as a result  may be more likely to recommend our competitors products and services 
in addition  some of our competitors have relationships with a greater number of these systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and alliance partners and  therefore  have access to a broader base of enterprise customers 
if we are unable to establish  maintain and strengthen these relationships  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the selling and marketing  implementation and support of our products 
our efforts may not be as effective as these systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and alliance partners  which could significantly harm our operating results 
our international operations expose us to business risks which could cause our operating results to suffer our international revenues are generally transacted from our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in local currency 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries generally incur their expenses in local currency 
approximately  and of our total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  were from our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  approximately  and of our expenses for fiscal  and  respectively  were from our foreign subsidiaries 
at june  and june   approximately and  respectively  of our total assets were located at our foreign subsidiaries 
many of our customers have operations in numerous locations around the globe 
in order to attract  retain and service multi national customers  we have to maintain strong direct and indirect sales and support organizations in europe and asia pacific 
our ability to penetrate international markets may be impaired by resource constraints and our ability to hire qualified personnel in foreign countries 
we face a number of risks associated with conducting business internationally  which could negatively impact our operating results  including  without limitation difficulties relating to the management  administration and staffing of a globally dispersed business  longer sales cycles associated with educating foreign customers on the benefits of our products and services  
table of contents longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in providing customer support for our products in multiple time zones  currency fluctuations and exchange rates  limitations on repatriation of earnings of our foreign operations  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures  negative tax consequences such as withholding taxes and employer payroll taxes  language barriers  the need to consider numerous international product characteristics  different accounting practices  import export duties and tariffs  quotas and controls  complex and inflexible employment laws  economic or political instability in some international markets  and conflicting international business practices 
we believe that expansion into new international markets will be necessary for our future success 
therefore  a key aspect of our strategy is to continue to expand our presence in foreign markets 
we may not succeed in our efforts to enter new international markets 
if we fail to do so  we may not be able to maintain existing levels of revenues and promote growth in our revenues 
this international expansion may be more difficult or time consuming than we anticipate 
it is also costly to establish and maintain international facilities and operations and promote our products internationally 
thus  if revenues from international activities do not offset the expenses of establishing and maintaining foreign operations  our operating results will suffer 
our services revenues and operating results may be adversely affected if we are not able to maintain the billing and utilization rates for our professional services personnel the billing rates we charge for our professional services and the utilization  or chargeability  of our professional services personnel are significant components of our services revenues  gross margin and operating results 
our billing rates are affected by a number of factors  including the introduction of new services or products by our competitors  the pricing policies of our competitors  demand for professional services and general economic conditions 
our utilization rates are also affected by a number of factors  including seasonal trends  our ability to transition employees from completed professional services engagements to new engagements and our ability to forecast demand of our professional services and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount 
many of the above factors are beyond our control 

table of contents accordingly  if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our professional services or an appropriate utilization for our professional services personnel  our service revenues and gross margin are likely to decline  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we occasionally perform professional services engagements on a fixed price basis  which could cause a decline in our gross margins we occasionally perform professional services engagements on a fixed price basis 
prior to performing a fixed price professional services engagement  we estimate the amount of work involved for the engagement 
however  we may underestimate the amount of time or resources required to complete a professional services engagement  and we may not be able to charge the customer for the additional work performed 
if we do not correctly estimate the amount of time or resources required for a professional services engagement and we are not able to charge the customer for the additional work performed  our gross margins would decline  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we depend on licensed third party technology  the loss of which could result in increased costs of or delays in licensing our products we license technology from several companies on a non exclusive basis that is integrated into many of our products 
we also license certain enterprise interoperability products from third parties 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future 
this software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
some of the software we license from third parties would be difficult and time consuming to replace 
the loss of any of these technology licenses could result in delays in the licensing of our products until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated 
in addition  the effective implementation of our products may depend upon the successful operation of third party licensed products in conjunction with our products  and therefore any undetected errors in these licensed products may prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products  delay new product introductions or injure our reputation 
we may not be able to increase revenues if we do not expand our sales and distribution channels and improve our sales execution we will need to expand our direct and indirect global sales operations and improve our sales execution in order to increase market awareness and acceptance of our software and generate increased revenues 
we market and license our products directly through our sales organization and indirectly through our global alliance partner and distributor network 
our ability to increase our global direct sales organization will depend on our ability to recruit  train and retain sales personnel with advanced sales skills and technical knowledge 
competition for qualified sales personnel is intense in our industry 
in addition  it may take up to nine months for a new sales person to become fully productive 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified sales personnel  or if newly hired or existing sales personnel fail to develop the necessary skills or reach productivity more slowly than anticipated  we may have difficulty licensing our products  and we may experience a shortfall in anticipated revenues 
in addition  we believe that our future success is dependent upon expansion of our indirect global distribution channel  which consists of our relationships with a variety of systems integrators  complementary technology vendors and distributors 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our current relationships or establish relationships with additional distribution partners on a timely basis  or at all 
our distribution partners may not devote adequate resources to promoting or selling our products and may not be successful 
in addition  we may also face potential conflicts between our direct sales force and third party reselling efforts 
any failure to expand our indirect global distribution channel or increase the productivity of this distribution channel could result in lower than anticipated revenues 

table of contents due to the weak global economy  our customers may experience financial difficulties and may represent a credit risk due to the weak global economy and the uncertainty relating to the prospects for near term global economic growth  some of our customers may experience financial difficulties and may represent a credit risk to us 
if our customers  especially those with limited operating histories and limited access to capital  experience financial difficulties or fail to experience commercial success  we may have difficulty collecting our accounts receivable and be required to record additional allowances for doubtful accounts  which will increase our operating expenses 
if systems integrators are not available or fail to perform adequately  our customers may suffer implementation delays and a lower quality of customer service  and we may incur increased expenses systems integrators often are retained by our customers to implement our products 
if experienced systems integrators are not available to implement our products  we will be required to provide these services internally  and we may not have sufficient resources to meet our customers implementation needs on a timely basis 
use of our professional services personnel to implement our products would also increase our expenses 
in addition  we cannot control the level and quality of service provided by our current and future implementation partners 
if these systems integrators do not perform to the satisfaction of our customers  our customers could become dissatisfied with our products  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively  and if we are unable to retain key personnel  our ability to compete could be harmed our ability to implement our business strategy and our future success depends largely on the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering  sales  marketing and support personnel who have critical industry or customer experience and relationships 
none of our key personnel  other than mark f 
o connell  our president and chief executive officer  is bound by an employment agreement 
we do not have key man life insurance on any of our employees 
the loss of the technical knowledge and management and industry expertise of any of these key personnel could result in delays in product development  loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  our future performance depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified sales  engineering  marketing  services and managerial personnel  and there is intense competition for such personnel 
if we do not succeed in retaining our personnel or in attracting new employees  our business could suffer significantly 
our products may contain defects that could harm our reputation  be costly to correct  delay revenues and expose us to litigation despite testing by us  our alliance partners and our customers  errors may be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
we and our customers have from time to time discovered errors in our software products 
in the future  there may be additional errors and defects in our software 
if errors are discovered  we may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all 
errors and failures in our products could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and damage to our reputation and our ability to convince commercial users of the benefits of our products 
in addition  we may need to make significant expenditures of capital resources in order to eliminate errors and failures 
since our products are used by customers for mission critical applications  errors  defects or other performance problems could also result in financial or other damages to our customers  who could assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us 
although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to 
table of contents potential product liability claims  it is possible that such provisions may not be effective or enforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  our insurance policies may not adequately limit our exposure with respect to such claims 
a product liability claim  even if unsuccessful  would be costly and time consuming to defend and could harm our business 
future acquisitions may negatively affect our ongoing business operations and our operating results we may expand our operations or market presence by acquiring or investing in complementary businesses  products or technologies that complement our business  increase our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer opportunities for growth 
these transactions create risks such as difficulty assimilating the operations  technology  products and personnel we acquire  disruption of our ongoing business  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  one time charges and expenses associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets  and potential dilution to our stockholders 
our inability to address these risks could negatively impact our operating results 
moreover  any future acquisitions  even if successfully completed  may not generate any additional revenues or provide any benefit to our business 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital as needed in the future  our business may be adversely affected and the market price for our common stock could significantly decline we have been unable to fund our operations using cash generated from our business operations and have financed our operations principally through the sale of securities 
we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital to fund an expansion of our operations  to enhance our products and services  or to acquire or invest in complementary products  services  businesses or technologies 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution  and any new equity securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on terms favorable to us  our business may be adversely affected and the market price for our common stock could significantly decline 
our business may be adversely affected by securities class action litigation on april   a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the complaint  which superseded five virtually identical complaints that had been filed from july  to september   names as defendants the company  two of our officers  and certain underwriters involved in our initial public offering of common stock ipo 
the complaint is allegedly brought on behalf of purchasers of our common stock during the period from february  to december  and asserts  among other things  that our ipo prospectus and registration statement violated federal securities laws because they contained material misrepresentations and or omissions regarding the conduct of our ipo underwriters in allocating shares in our ipo to the underwriters customers  and that the company and the two named officers 
table of contents engaged in fraudulent practices with respect to the underwriters conduct 
the action seeks damages  fees and costs associated with the litigation  and interest 
we and our officers and directors believe that the allegations in the complaint are without merit and have defended the litigation vigorously 
the litigation process is inherently uncertain and unpredictable  however  and there can be no guarantee as to the ultimate outcome of this pending lawsuit 
pursuant to a stipulation between the parties  the company s two named officers were dismissed from the lawsuit  without prejudice  on october  on february   the court ruled on a motion to dismiss the complaint that had been filed by the company  along with the three hundred plus other publicly traded companies that have been named by various plaintiffs in substantially similar lawsuits 
the court granted the company s motion to dismiss the claim filed against it under section b of the securities exchange act of  but denied the company s motion to dismiss the claim filed against it under section of the securities act of  as it denied the motions under this statute for virtually every other company sued in the substantially similar lawsuits 
in june  the company  implementing the determination made by a special independent committee of the board of directors  elected to participate in a proposed settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in this litigation 
if ultimately approved by the court  this proposed settlement would result in a dismissal  with prejudice  of all claims in the litigation against us and against any of the other issuer defendants who elect to participate in the proposed settlement  together with the current or former officers and directors of participating issuers who were named as individual defendants 
the proposed settlement does not provide for the resolution of any claims against the underwriter defendants  and the litigation as against those defendants is continuing 
the proposed settlement provides that the class members in the class action cases brought against the participating issuer defendants will be guaranteed a recovery of billion by insurers of the participating issuer defendants 
if recoveries totaling billion or more are obtained by the class members from the underwriter defendants  however  the monetary obligations to the class members under the proposed settlement will be satisfied 
in addition  the company and any other participating issuer defendants will be required to assign to the class members certain claims that they may have against the underwriters of their ipos 
the proposed settlement contemplates that any amounts necessary to fund the settlement or settlement related expenses would come from participating issuers directors and officers liability insurance policy proceeds as opposed to funds of the participating issuer defendants themselves 
a participating issuer defendant could be required to contribute to the costs of the settlement if that issuer s insurance coverage were insufficient to pay that issuer s allocable share of the settlement costs 
the company expects that its insurance proceeds will be sufficient for these purposes and that it will not otherwise be required to contribute to the proposed settlement 
consummation of the proposed settlement is conditioned upon  among other things  negotiating  executing  and filing with the court final settlement documents  and final approval by the court 
if the proposed settlement described above is not consummated  the company intends to continue to defend the litigation vigorously 
moreover  if the proposed settlement is not consummated  we believe that the underwriters may have an obligation to indemnify us for the legal fees and other costs of defending this suit 
while we cannot guarantee the outcome of these proceedings  we believe that the final result of these actions will have no material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  the litigation process is inherently uncertain and unpredictable  and there can be no guarantee as to the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit 
even is successfully defended or settled  this lawsuit could result in significant expense to us and the diversion of our management and technical resources  which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the price of its securities 
due to the volatility of our stock price  we may be the target of securities litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources from our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results

to protect our intellectual property rights in the future  we intend to rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and common law safeguards  including trade secret protection 
we also rely on restrictions on use  confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements with our employees  affiliates  customers  alliance partners and others

effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services to the same extent as in the united states 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm or even destroy our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively 
further  enforcing our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and may not prove successful 
we could incur substantial costs defending our intellectual property from claims of infringement the software industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright  patent and other intellectual property rights 
we may be subject to future litigation based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others or that our own intellectual property rights are invalid 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products overlaps 
from time to time  we have received correspondence from competitors asserting potential infringement of intellectual property rights or other claims based upon the integration of our software with one or more of their software offerings  such integrations are typically performed at the request of mutual customers 
claims of infringement could require us to reengineer or rename our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products 
licensing or royalty agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
even if successfully defended  claims of infringement could also result in significant expense to us and the diversion of our management and technical resources 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile which may lead to losses by stockholders the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past 
during fiscal  our stock price fluctuated between a low bid price of per share and a high bid price of per share 
during fiscal  our stock price fluctuated between a low bid price of per share and a high bid price of per share 
we believe that the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future in response to a number of events and factors relating to our company  our competitors  the market for our products and services and the global economy  many of which are beyond our control  such as variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of software companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  
table of contents loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant business transactions  additions or departures of key personnel  the threat of additional litigation by current or former employees  customers  and shareholders  sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by existing shareholders  sales of common stock or other securities by us in the future  and news relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme volatility 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable 
these provisions may also prevent changes in our management 
these provisions include  without limitation authorizing the issuance of undesignated preferred stock  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  requiring super majority voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
certain provisions of delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have foreign subsidiaries in austria  canada  england  france  germany  italy  japan  korea  singapore and the netherlands 
our international revenues are generally transacted from our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in local currency 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries generally incur their expenses in local currency 
approximately  and of our total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  were from our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  approximately  and of our expenses for fiscal  and  respectively  were from our foreign subsidiaries 
at june  and june   approximately and  respectively  of our total assets were located at our foreign subsidiaries 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions 
our intercompany transactions are typically denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign currency risk at the parent company in the united states 
the parent company and our foreign subsidiaries may also transact business in a foreign currency 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results and balances of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition translation risk 
therefore  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks and fluctuations in foreign currencies  along with economic and political instability in the foreign countries in which we operate  all of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
our foreign currency hedging program is principally designed to mitigate the future potential impact of changes in the value of transactions denominated in foreign currency as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may impact our results of operations 
our foreign currency hedging program is not designed  nor do we enter into foreign currency contracts  to mitigate translation risk 
we use forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of accounts receivable and accounts payable and intercompany accounts receivable and intercompany accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies 
a forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates 
these forward contracts are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying foreign currency receivables or payables are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date that approximate the value and expected settlement date  respectively  of the underlying transactions 
unrealized gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period  resulting from changes in the fair value of these contracts  are recognized in earnings in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying foreign denominated receivables or payables are recognized and generally offset 
gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables and payables are included in other income expense  net 
we do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes  and we only enter into forward contracts with highly rated financial institutions 
at june   there were no open forward contracts 
we plan to increase our use of forward contracts and other instruments in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations from accounts receivable and accounts payable and intercompany accounts receivable and intercompany accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  and we may not be able to do this successfully 
accordingly  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on our results of operations as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
also  as we continue to expand our operations outside of the united states  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could increase 

table of contents we deposit our cash in highly rated financial institutions in north america  europe and asia pacific 
we invest in diversified united states and international money market mutual funds and united states treasury and agency securities 
at june   we had million  million  million and million invested in the united states  canada  continental europe and england  respectively 
at june   the weighted average interest rate on our investments was per annum 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe we have minimal market risk 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk 
all of our investments have remaining maturities of three months or less 
if these short term assets were reinvested in a declining interest rate environment  we would experience an immediate negative impact on other income 
the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment 
since january   the united states federal reserve board  european central bank and bank of england have significantly decreased certain benchmark interest rates  which has led to a general decline in market interest rates 
this decline in market interest rates has resulted in a significant decrease in our interest income 
we expect our interest income to continue to decrease in fiscal due to the recent decreases in market interest rates and lower levels of cash available for investment
