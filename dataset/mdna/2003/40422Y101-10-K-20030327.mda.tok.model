item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item contains forward looking statements with respect to possible events  outcomes or results that are  and are expected to continue to be  subject to risks  uncertainties and contingencies  including those identified in this item 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements on page webmd corporation is a delaware corporation that was incorporated in december and commenced operations in january as healtheon corporation 
our common stock has traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol hlth since february  in may  healtheon merged with actamed corporation 
in november  healtheon completed mergers with webmd  inc  mede america and medcast 
following these mergers  healtheon changed its name to healtheon webmd corporation 
healtheon webmd completed acquisitions of kinetra and envoy in january 
table of contents and may  respectively 
on september   healtheon webmd completed mergers with medical manager  careinsite and onhealth and changed its name to webmd corporation 
the following discussion reflects our plastic technologies business  porex  as a continuing operation since the date of its acquisition on september  previously  porex had been accounted for as an asset held for sale during the period from september  to september   and as discontinued operations subsequent to september  during february  we terminated our formal divestiture efforts relating to porex 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of webmd s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current business factors  and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  short term and long term investments  deferred tax assets  income taxes  collectibility of customer receivables  prepaid content and distribution services  long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  certain accrued expenses  accruals related to our restructuring program  contingencies and litigation 
we believe the following reflect our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue our revenue recognition policies for each reportable segment are as follows transaction services or webmd envoy 
healthcare payers and providers pay us fees for our services  generally on a per transaction basis or monthly basis 
we recognize revenue as we perform the service 
healthcare payers and providers also pay us one time implementation and annual maintenance fees 
we recognize revenue from these fees ratably over the term of the respective agreements 
physician services or webmd medical manager 
healthcare providers pay us one time fees for the purchase of our practice management systems 
we recognize revenue from these one time fees when we enter into noncancelable agreements with our customers  the products have been delivered and there are no uncertainties regarding product acceptance and delivery and no significant future performance obligations 
amounts received in advance of meeting these criteria are deferred until we meet these criteria 
revenue from multiple element software arrangements is recognized using the residual method as vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  but not for all of the delivered elements 
the residual method requires revenue to be allocated to the undelivered elements based on the fair value of such elements  as indicated by vsoe 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
healthcare providers also pay us fees for maintenance and support of their practice management system  including the hardware and software 
we recognize revenue from these fees ratably over the contract period  typically in one year or less 
healthcare providers also pay us fees for transmitting transactions to payers and patients 
we recognize revenue from these fees  which are generally paid on a monthly or per transaction basis  as we provide the service 
portal services or webmd health 
customers pay us for advertising  sponsorship  healthcare management tools  continuing medical education cme  content syndication and distribution  and e commerce transactions related to our online distribution channels and the online and offline distribution channels of our strategic partners 
in  we also were paid subscription fees for our physician portal 
revenue from advertising is recognized as advertisements are delivered 
revenues from sponsorship arrangements and healthcare management tools are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
revenue from cme arrangements is recognized over the period 
table of contents we satisfy the minimum credit hour requirements of the applicable agreements 
revenue from fixed fee content license or carriage fees is recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
e commerce revenue is recognized when a subscriber or consumer utilizes our internet based services or purchases goods or services through our web site or co branded web site with one of our strategic partners 
subscription revenue  including subscription revenue from sponsorship arrangements  is recognized over the subscription period 
when contractual arrangements contain multiple elements  revenue is allocated to the elements based on their relative fair values  determined using prices charged when elements are sold separately 
plastic technologies or porex 
we develop  manufacture and distribute porous and solid plastic products and components 
for standard products  we recognize revenue upon shipment of product  net of sales returns and allowances 
reserves are established for anticipated returns and allowances based on past experience 
for sales of certain custom products  we recognize revenue upon completion and customer acceptance 
amounts received in advance of meeting these criteria are deferred until we meet these criteria 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets arise from the acquisitions we have made 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on our estimates of the future benefit of the intangible asset using accepted valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determined based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of goodwill 
there was no impairment of goodwill noted as a result of our impairment testing in during  we identified certain indicators of possible impairment of our long lived assets  primarily goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluated our long lived assets for impairment by determining identifiable cash flows to related asset groupings  and compared the projected undiscounted cash flows for each asset grouping to its carrying value 
once we determined there was an impairment  we quantified the impairment based on projected discounted cash flows 
other unknown future indications of possible impairment charges  such as a significant downturn in one of our business segments or reporting units or general economic conditions  could result in an additional assessment of our long lived assets for impairment and could result in an additional impairment charge in the future 
investments our investments at december   consist principally of certificates of deposit  municipal bonds  asset backed securities  federal agency notes  us treasury notes and an equity investment in a publicly traded company 
each reporting period we evaluate the carrying value of our investments and record a loss on investments when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
we do not recognize gains on an investment until sold 
our carrying value is not necessarily indicative of the underlying value of an investment 
future changes in market or economic conditions or operating results of our investments could result in gains or losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s carrying value 
deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately billion 
these loss carryforwards may be used to offset taxable income in future periods reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
due to a lack of a history of generating taxable income  we record a valuation allowance equal to of our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that we are able to generate taxable earnings in the future and determine it is more likely than not that we can realize our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made which may increase income in the period that such determination was made 

table of contents restructuring and integration in connection with our restructuring and integration efforts  modifications to our strategic relationship with news corporation resulted in a change in the carrying value of advertising services we have the rights to  classified as prepaid content and distribution services 
we estimated the fair value of our rights under the new agreement using a discounted cash flow approach 
this estimate also affects the amortization of this asset in future periods over the contractual term 
also  in connection with our restructuring and integration efforts  we recorded charges for estimated future lease obligations and lease cancellation penalties related to exited facilities based on many different variables  such as the term to expiration  contractual rights under the lease agreement and current real estate market conditions 
future changes in any of these variables  such as a change in real estate market conditions  could have an impact on these estimates 
acquisition history we rapidly and significantly expanded our operations through acquisitions

as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital of million 
additionally  we had long term investments of million in marketable debt securities and million in marketable equity securities 
we invest our excess cash principally in us treasury obligations and federal agency notes and expect to do so in the future 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to cash used in operating activities of million in the cash provided from operating activities was primarily a result of the net loss of million and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  offset by non cash charges of million 
the cash used in operating activities a year ago was primarily attributable to a net loss of billion  offset primarily by non cash charges of billion 
the non cash charges consist of depreciation and amortization  impairment of long lived and other assets  non cash expenses related to content and distribution services and stock compensation  amortization of debt issuance costs and the non cash portion of the restructuring and integration charge 
cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in cash used in investing activities during primarily related to million of purchases of held to maturity and available for sale securities  partially offset by million of proceeds from the maturities  sales and redemption of available for sale and held to maturity securities

cash paid in business combinations in was million and related to the medscape and physician services acquisitions 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily related to the receipt of net proceeds of million from our offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes

cash used in financing activities was million in  primarily related to million used to repurchase shares of our common stock partially offset by million net proceeds from exercises of employee stock options 
as of december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
our principal commitments at december  consisted primarily of our commitments related to the million of convertible subordinated notes  obligations under operating leases and guaranteed payments under our strategic agreements 
we had entered into agreements that provided for us to make aggregate guaranteed payments in the following estimated amounts  net of sublease income  under operating leases and our strategic relationships 
the lease amounts include leases identified in our restructuring and integration efforts 

table of contents strategic year ending december  leases relationships total in millions thereafter we believe that we will have sufficient cash resources to meet our presently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements  including the capital requirements related to the roll out of our new products in  for the foreseeable future 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the success of the integration of our businesses  retention of customers at current volume and revenue levels  our existing and new application and service offerings  competing technological and market developments  potential future acquisitions and additional repurchases of our common stock 
in addition  we have been incurring  and expect to continue to incur  costs relating to our own compliance with the healthcare insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  and for assistance we provide to our customers in their compliance efforts 
our ability to perform our services in compliance with hipaa and the cost to us of doing so will depend on  among other things  the status of the compliance efforts of our payer and provider customers and the extent of the need to adjust our systems and procedures in response to changes in their systems and procedures 
we may need to raise additional funds to support expansion  develop new or enhanced applications and services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
if required  we may raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  the statement requires us to disclose in both annual and interim financial statements the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on our reported results 
the statement is effective for annual periods ending after december  and interim periods beginning after december  we apply the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
the interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made in our interim and annual financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees 
it also requires us to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december  the initial measurement and recognition provisions are required to be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we expect that the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires recording costs associated with exit or disposal activities at 
table of contents their fair values when a liability has been incurred 
under previous guidance  certain exit costs were accrued upon management s commitment to an exit plan  which is generally before an actual liability has been incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have an impact on the timing of the recording of any future restructuring charges 
effective january   we adopted eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which requires reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses to be classified as revenue as opposed to being offset against the related expense 
application of eitf no 
is required for financial reporting periods beginning after december  upon application  comparative financial statements for prior periods are required to be reclassified to comply with this guidance 
as a result of applying eitf no 
 we reclassified reimbursements we received for out of pocket expenses related to postage for customized billing statements mailed to patients on behalf of healthcare providers 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets 
we adopted this pronouncement beginning january  sfas no 
prescribes the accounting for long lived assets excluding goodwill to be disposed of by sale 
sfas no 
retains the requirement of sfas no 
to measure long lived assets classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair market value less the cost to sell 
therefore  discontinued operations are no longer measured on a net realizable basis  and future operating results are no longer recognized before they occur 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for the costs of asset retirement obligations 
under sfas no 
 the future costs of retiring a tangible long lived asset will be recorded as a liability at its present value when the retirement obligation arises  and will be amortized to expense over the life of the asset 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
effective july  and january   we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 i no amortization was recorded for goodwill resulting from business combinations completed after june   ii effective january   the amortization of goodwill was eliminated  and iii certain amounts previously classified as intangible assets were reclassified as goodwill and consequently  no longer subject to amortization 
additionally  there was no impairment of goodwill upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   or in connection with the annual impairment test that was performed during the quarter ended december  factors that may affect our future financial condition or results of operations this section describes circumstances or events that could have a negative effect on our financial results or operations or that could change  for the worse  existing trends in some or all of our businesses 
the occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows or on the trading prices of the common stock and convertible notes that we have issued 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing webmd 
additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations 

table of contents risks related to our relationships with customers and strategic partners webmd envoy s transaction volume and financial results could be adversely affected if we do not maintain relationships with practice management system vendors and large submitters of healthcare edi transactions we have developed relationships with practice management system vendors and large submitters of healthcare claims to increase the usage of our webmd envoy transaction services 
webmd medical manager is a competitor of these practice management system vendors 
these vendors  as a result of our ownership of webmd medical manager or for other reasons  may choose in the future to diminish or terminate their relationships with webmd envoy 
some other large submitters of claims compete with  or may have significant relationships with entities that compete with  webmd envoy or webmd health 
to the extent that we are not able to maintain mutually satisfactory relationships with the larger practice management system vendors and large submitters of healthcare edi transactions  webmd envoy s transaction volume and financial results could be adversely affected 
webmd envoy s transaction volume and financial results could be adversely affected if payers and providers conduct edi transactions without using a clearinghouse there can be no assurance that healthcare payers and providers will continue to use webmd envoy and other independent companies to transmit healthcare transactions 
some payers currently offer electronic data transmission services to healthcare providers that establish a direct link between the provider and payer  bypassing third party edi service providers such as webmd envoy 
any significant increase in the utilization of direct links between healthcare providers and payers could have a material adverse effect on webmd envoy s transaction volume and financial results 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing links to payers or develop new connections on satisfactory terms  if at all 
loss of a small number of advertisers and sponsors could have a material adverse effect on webmd health s revenues a substantial portion of webmd health s revenues come from a relatively small number of advertisers and sponsors 
we expect this to continue in the future 
thus  the loss of one or a small number of relationships with advertisers and sponsors or reduction of their purchases could have a material adverse effect on our portal services revenues 
we may lose such relationships or experience a reduction in purchases if customers decide not to renew their commitments or renew at lower levels  which may occur if we fail to meet our customers expectations or needs or to keep up with our competition or for reasons outside our control  including changes in economic and regulatory conditions affecting the healthcare industry or changes specific to the businesses of particular customers 
see developments in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business on page and government regulation beginning on page third parties may bring claims as a result of the activities of our strategic partners we could be subject to claims by third parties  and to liability  as a result of the activities  products or services of our strategic partners 
we state on our web sites that we do not control or endorse the products or services of our strategic partners 
however  there can be no assurance that the statements made in our portal will be found to be sufficient to ensure that we are not held responsible for such activities  products or services 
furthermore  even if these claims do not result in liability to us  
table of contents investigating and defending these claims could be expensive  time consuming and result in adverse publicity that could harm our business 
risks related to the performance of our healthcare information services and technology solutions our ability to generate revenue could suffer if we do not continue to update and improve our existing products and services and develop new ones we must introduce new healthcare information services and technology solutions and improve the functionality of our existing products and services in a timely manner in order to retain existing customers and attract new ones 
however  we may not be successful in responding to technological developments and changing customer needs 
the pace of change in the markets we serve is rapid  and there are frequent new product and service introductions by our competitors and by vendors whose products and services we use in providing our own products and services 
if we do not respond successfully to technological changes and evolving industry standards  our products and services may become obsolete 
technological changes may also result in the offering of competitive products and services at lower prices than we are charging for our products and services  which could result in our losing sales unless we lower the prices we charge 
we rely on a combination of internal development  strategic relationships  licensing and acquisitions to develop our products and services 
the cost of developing new healthcare information services and technology solutions is inherently difficult to estimate 
our development of proposed products and services may take longer than originally expected  require more testing than originally anticipated and require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the products we develop or license will be able to compete with the alternatives available to our customers 
see competition for our healthcare information services and technology solutions beginning on page new or newly integrated products and services will not become profitable unless they achieve sufficient levels of market acceptance there can be no assurance that healthcare providers and payers will accept from us new products and services or products and services that result from integrating existing and or acquired products and services  including the products and services we are developing to integrate our transaction services and portal services into the physician office workflow  such as our handheld solution 
even providers and payers who are already our customers may not purchase new or newly integrated products or services  especially when they are initially offered 
providers using our existing products and services may refuse to adopt new or newly integrated products and services when they have made extensive investments in hardware  software and training relating to those existing products and services 
similarly  other healthcare participants may not accept new or newly integrated products and services that we develop for their use 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any pricing strategy that we implement for any such products and services will be economically viable or acceptable to the target markets 
failure to achieve broad penetration in target markets with respect to new or newly integrated products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects 
achieving market acceptance of new or newly integrated products and services is likely to require significant efforts and expenditures achieving market acceptance for new or newly integrated products and services is likely to require substantial marketing efforts and expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand by participants in the healthcare industry 
in addition  deployment of new or newly integrated products and services may require the use of additional resources for training our existing sales force and customer service personnel and for hiring and training additional salespersons and customer service personnel 
there 
table of contents can be no assurance that the revenue opportunities from new or newly integrated products and services will justify amounts spent for their development  marketing and roll out 
we could be subject to breach of warranty claims if our software products  information technology systems or transmission systems contain errors  experience failures or do not meet customer expectations we could face breach of warranty or other claims or additional development costs if the software and systems we sell or license to customers or use to provide services contain undetected errors  experience failures  do not perform in accordance with their documentation  or do not meet the expectations that our customers have for them 
these software and systems are inherently complex and  despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in prior versions  current versions or future versions or enhancements 
in particular  during times when we are making significant changes or improvements to our products and services  such as those required by hipaa  there is increased risk of error 
undetected errors in the software and systems we provide or those we use to provide services could cause serious problems for which our customers may seek compensation from us 
for example  errors in our transaction processing systems can result in healthcare payers paying the wrong amount or making payments to the wrong payee 
we attempt to limit  by contract  our liability for damages arising from negligence  errors or mistakes 
however  contractual limitations on liability may not be enforceable in certain circumstances or may otherwise not provide sufficient protection to us from liability for damages 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  investigating and defending against them could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from our operations 
in addition  negative publicity caused by these events may delay market acceptance of our products and services  including unrelated products and services 
we could be subject to product liability claims if our products malfunction or provide inaccurate information we provide products and services that assist in healthcare decision making  including some that relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans 
if these products malfunction or fail to provide accurate and timely information  we could be subject to product liability claims 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  investigating and defending against them could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from our operations 
in addition  negative publicity caused by these events may delay market acceptance of our products and services  including unrelated products and services 
we attempt to limit  by contract  our liability for damages arising from negligence  errors or mistakes 
however  contractual limitations on liability may not be enforceable in certain circumstances or may otherwise not provide sufficient protection to us from liability for damages 
we maintain general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors and omissions 
however  it is possible that claims could exceed the amount of our applicable insurance coverage or that this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts 
we could lose customers and revenues if we fail to meet the performance standards in our contracts many of our customer contracts contain performance standards 
if we fail to meet these standards  our customers may seek to terminate their agreements with us  withhold payments due to us  seek refunds from us of part or all of the fees charged under those agreements or initiate litigation or other dispute resolution procedures 
despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that we will meet these performance standards 
to the extent we fail to achieve these standards  our revenues and customer relationships could be adversely affected 

table of contents if our systems or the internet experience security breaches or are otherwise perceived to be insecure  our business could suffer a security breach could damage our reputation or result in liability 
we retain and transmit confidential information  including patient health information  in our processing centers and other facilities 
it is critical that these facilities and infrastructure remain secure and be perceived by the marketplace as secure 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and hackers or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
despite the implementation of security measures  this infrastructure or other systems that we interface with  including the internet and related systems  may be vulnerable to physical break ins  hackers  improper employee or contractor access  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems 
any compromise of our security  whether as a result of our own systems or systems that they interface with  could reduce demand for our services 
performance problems with webmd envoy s systems could adversely affect our business our payer and provider customer satisfaction and our business could be harmed if webmd envoy experiences delays  failures or loss of data in its systems 
we currently process our payer and provider transactions and data at our facilities and at a data center in tampa  florida that is operated by an independent third party 
we have contingency plans for emergencies with our systems  however  we have limited backup facilities to process information if these facilities are not functioning 
the occurrence of a major catastrophic event or other system failure at any of our facilities or at the third party facility could interrupt data processing or result in the loss of stored data  which could have a material adverse impact on our business 
webmd envoy s ability to provide transaction services depends on services provided by telecommunications companies webmd envoy relies on a limited number of suppliers to provide some of the telecommunications services necessary for its transaction services 
the telecommunications industry has been subject to significant changes as a result of changes in technology  regulation and the underlying economy 
recently  many telecommunications companies have experienced financial problems and some have sought bankruptcy protection 
some of these companies have discontinued telecommunications services for which they had contractual obligations to webmd envoy 
webmd envoy s inability to source telecommunications services at reasonable prices due to a loss of competitive suppliers could affect its ability to maintain its margins until it is able to raise its prices to its customers and  if it is not able to raise its prices  could have a material adverse effect on its financial results 
risks related to providing products and services to the healthcare industry developments in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business almost all of the revenues of webmd health  webmd envoy and webmd medical manager come from customers in various parts of the healthcare industry 
in addition  a significant portion of porex s revenues come from products used in healthcare or related applications 
developments that result in a reduction of expenditures by customers or potential customers in the healthcare industry could have a material adverse effect on our business 
general reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from  among other things government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare providers interact with patients  payers or other healthcare industry participants  including changes in pricing or means of delivery of healthcare products and services for additional discussion of the potential effects of regulatory matters on our business and on participants in the healthcare industry  see government regulation beginning on page  
table of contents consolidation of healthcare industry participants  reductions in governmental funding for healthcare  and adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting healthcare payers or providers  pharmaceutical companies  medical device manufacturers or other healthcare industry participants 
even if general expenditures by industry participants remain the same or increase  developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending on information technology and services or in some or all of the specific segments of that market we serve or are planning to serve 
for example  use of our products and services could be affected by changes in the billing patterns of healthcare providers  changes in the design of health insurance plans  changes in the contracting methods payers use in their relationships with providers  and decreases in marketing expenditures by pharmaceutical companies or medical device manufacturers  including as a result of governmental regulation or private initiatives that discourage or prohibit promotional activities by pharmaceutical or medical device companies 
in addition  expectations of our customers regarding pending or potential industry developments may also affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to products and services of the types we provide 
the healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur 
however  the timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict 
we cannot provide assurance that the markets for our products and services will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical  financial and marketing resources to react to changes in those markets 
government regulation of healthcare and healthcare information technology  including hipaa  creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies general 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  regulatory and other influences 
these factors affect the purchasing practices and operations of healthcare organizations 
federal and state legislatures and agencies periodically consider programs to reform or revise the united states healthcare system 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions  including investments in our applications and services 
we are unable to predict future proposals with any certainty or to predict the effect they would have on our business 
existing laws and regulations also could create liability  cause us to incur additional cost or restrict our operations 
hipaa 
as described under government regulation health insurance portability and accountability act of beginning on page and webmd envoy hipaa on page  the effect of hipaa on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurances that we will adequately address the business risks created by the hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 
we may incur significant expenses relating to compliance with hipaa 
our ability to perform our transaction services in compliance with hipaa and the cost to us of doing so will depend on  among other things  the status of the compliance efforts of our payer and provider customers and the extent of the need to adjust our systems and procedures in response to changes in their systems and procedures 
we cannot control when or how payers  providers  practice management system vendors or other healthcare participants will comply with hipaa s transaction standards or predict how their compliance efforts will affect their relationships with us  including the volume of transactions for which they use our services 
in addition  our technological and strategic 
table of contents responses to hipaa may result in conflicts with  or other adverse changes in our relationships with  some healthcare industry participants  including some who are existing or potential customers for our products and services or existing or potential strategic partners 
furthermore  we are unable to predict what changes to hipaa  or the regulations issued pursuant to hipaa  might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance with hipaa 
healthcare relationships 
a federal law commonly known as the medicare medicaid anti kickback law and several similar state laws prohibit payments that are intended to induce healthcare providers either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services 
these laws are broad and may apply to some of our activities or our relationships with our customers  advertisers or strategic partners 
other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for payment from medicare  medicaid  or other third party payers that are false or fraudulent  or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed 
since we provide transaction services to healthcare providers  we cannot provide assurance that the government will regard errors in transactions processed by us as inadvertent and not in violation of these laws 
anti kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance that can be substantial 
even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities or our practices could cause us adverse publicity and be costly for us to respond to 
regulation of medical devices 
certain of porex s products are fda regulated medical devices  such as plastic and reconstructive surgical implants  intravenous administration sets  blood filters  and tissue expanders 
these products are subject to comprehensive government regulation under the food  drug and cosmetic act and implementing regulations 
in addition  the fda regulates webmd medical manager s dim 
dx 
system as a medical image management device 
if the fda finds that we have not complied with required procedures  it can bring a wide variety of enforcement actions that could result in severe civil and criminal sanctions 
porex is also subject to similar regulation in international markets  with similar risks 
future medical devices that porex or webmd medical manager wish to bring to market may be required to obtain k clearance or premarket approval from the fda  as well as similar clearances and approvals from governmental authorities outside of the united states  which can be expensive  time consuming and burdensome to obtain

we have privacy policies posted on our consumer portal and our professional portal that we believe comply with applicable laws requiring notice to users about our information collection  use and disclosure practices 
however  whether and how existing privacy and consumer protection laws in various jurisdictions apply to the internet is still uncertain and may take years to resolve

we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to generate sufficient advertising or sponsorship revenue from the webmd medscape health network to operate it profitably 
we sometimes enter into relationships with advertisers and sponsors in which we agree to be compensated based on specific negotiated criteria designed to demonstrate the value of our portal services

implementation of changes in hardware and software platforms used to deliver our web sites may result in performance problems from time to time  we implement changes to the hardware and software platforms we use for creating and delivering our web sites 
during and after the implementation of those changes  a platform may not perform as expected  which could result in interruptions in the operation of our web sites  an increase in response time of those sites or an inability to track performance metrics 
any significant interruption in our ability to operate our web sites could have an adverse effect on our relationship with users and sponsors and  as a result  on our financial results 
our internet based services rely on third party service providers our web sites are designed to operate hours a day  seven days a week  without interruption 
to do so  we rely on communications and hosting services provided by third parties 
we do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services 
to operate without interruption  both we and our service providers must guard against damage from fire  power loss and other natural disasters  communications failures  software and hardware errors  failures or crashes  security breaches  computer viruses and similar disruptive problems  and other potential interruptions 
we have experienced periodic system interruptions in the past  and we cannot guarantee that they will not occur again 
in addition  our web sites may  at times  be required to accommodate higher than usual 
table of contents volumes of traffic 
at those times  our web sites may experience slower response times or system failures 
any sustained or repeated interruptions or disruptions in these systems or increase in their response times could result in reduced usage of our web sites and could damage our relationships with strategic partners  advertisers and sponsors 
although we maintain insurance for our business  we cannot guarantee that our insurance will be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur or to provide for costs associated with business interruptions 
our internet based services are dependent on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure our ability to deliver our internet based services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  as well as timely development of complementary products such as high speed modems  for providing reliable internet access and services 
the internet has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and the amount of traffic 
if the internet continues to experience increased usage  the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it 
in addition  the performance of the internet may be harmed by increased usage 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure  and it could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as the availability of the internet to us for delivery of our internet based services 
in addition  our customers who utilize our web based services depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to our web site 
all of these providers have experienced significant outages in the past and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties in the future due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
any significant interruptions in our services or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users of and advertisers and sponsors on our web site and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the attractiveness of our services 
third parties may challenge the enforceability of our online agreements the law governing the validity and enforceability of online agreements and other electronic transactions is evolving 
we could be subject to claims by third parties that our online agreements with consumers and physicians that provide the terms and conditions for use of our portal services and physician services are unenforceable 
a finding by a court that these agreements are invalid could harm our business and require costly changes to our portals 
third parties may bring claims against us as a result of content provided on our web site  which may be expensive and time consuming to defend we could be subject to third party claims based on the nature and content of information supplied on our web site by us or third parties  including content providers  medical advisors or users 
we could also be subject to liability for content that may be accessible through our web site or third party web sites linked from our web site or through content and information that may be posted by users in chat rooms  bulletin boards or on web sites created by professionals using our web site application 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from our operations 
some of our services will not be widely adopted until broadband connectivity is more generally available some of our services and planned services require a continuous broadband connection between the physician s office and our data center and or the internet 
the availability of broadband connectivity varies widely from location to location and even within a single geographic area  due to factors such as the distance of a site from the central switching office 
the future availability of broadband connections is 
table of contents unpredictable and is not within our control 
while we expect that many physician office locations will remain without ready access to broadband connectivity for some period of time  we cannot predict how long that will be 
accordingly  the lack of these broadband connections will continue to place limitations on the number of sites that are able to utilize our internet based services and the revenue we can expect to generate from those services 
risks related to porex s business and industry porex s success depends upon demand for its products  which in some cases ultimately depends upon end user demand for the products of its customers demand for our porex products may change materially as a result of economic or market conditions and other trends that affect the industries in which it participates 
in addition  because a significant portion of our porex products are components that are eventually integrated into or used with products manufactured by customers for resale to end users  the demand for these product components is dependent on product development cycles and marketing efforts of these other manufacturers  as well as variations in their inventory levels  which are factors that we are unable to control 
accordingly  the amount of porex s sales to manufacturer customers can be difficult to predict and subject to wide quarter to quarter variances 
porex s success may depend upon satisfying rapidly changing customer requirements a significant portion of our porex products are integrated into end products used in various industries  some of which are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and practices and frequent new product introductions 
accordingly  porex s success will depend to a substantial degree on our ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner products that meet changing customer requirements and to differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors 
if we do not introduce new porex products in a timely manner and make enhancements to existing products to meet the changing needs of our porex customers  some of our products could become obsolete over time  in which case our customer relationships  revenue and operating results would be negatively impacted 
potential new or enhanced porex products may not achieve sufficient sales to be profitable or justify the cost of their development we cannot be certain  when we engage in porex research and development activities  whether potential new products or product enhancements will be accepted by the customers for which they are intended 
achieving market acceptance for new or enhanced products may require substantial marketing efforts and expenditure of significant funds to create awareness and demand by potential customers 
in addition  sales and marketing efforts with respect to these products may require the use of additional resources for training our existing porex sales forces and customer service personnel and for hiring and training additional salespersons and customer service personnel 
there can be no assurance that the revenue opportunities from new or enhanced products will justify amounts spent for their development and marketing 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any pricing strategy that we implement for any new or enhanced porex products will be economically viable or acceptable to the target markets 
porex may not be able to source the raw materials it needs or may have to pay more for those raw materials some of porex s products require high grade plastic resins with specific properties as raw materials 
while porex has not experienced any material difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies of high grade plastic resins that meet its requirements  it relies on a limited number of sources for some of these plastic resins 
if porex experiences a reduction or interruption in supply from these sources  it may not be able to access alternative sources of supply within a reasonable period of time or at commercially reasonable rates  which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial results 

table of contents porex also uses a variety of plastic resins that are generally available from a number of suppliers 
however  the raw materials for these plastic resins are petroleum based and may be subject to significant and rapid price increases based on factors affecting the pricing of petroleum products in general  which could have a material adverse effect on the margins of some of our plastic products 
disruptions in porex s manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial results any significant disruption in porex s manufacturing operations  including as a result of fire  power interruptions  equipment malfunctions  labor disputes  material shortages  earthquakes  floods  computer viruses  sabotage  terrorist acts or other force majeure  could have a material adverse effect on porex s ability to deliver products to customers and  accordingly  its financial results 
the nature of porex s products exposes it to product liability claims that may not be adequately covered by indemnity agreements or insurance the products sold by porex  whether sold directly to end users or sold to other manufacturers for inclusion in the products that they sell  expose it to potential risk of product liability claims  particularly with respect to porex s life sciences  clinical  surgical and medical products 
some of porex s products are designed to be permanently implanted in the human body 
design defects and manufacturing defects with respect to such products sold by porex or failures that occur with the products of porex s manufacturer customers that contain components made by porex could result in product liability claims and or a recall of one or more of porex s products 
porex also manufactures products that are used in the processing of blood for medical procedures and the delivery of medication to patients 
porex believes that it carries adequate insurance coverage against product liability claims and other risks 
we cannot assure you  however  that claims in excess of porex s insurance coverage will not arise 
in addition  porex s insurance policies must be renewed annually 
although porex has been able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost in the past  we cannot assure you that porex will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost 
in most instances  porex enters into indemnity agreements with its manufacturing customers 
these indemnity agreements generally provide that these customers would indemnify porex from liabilities that may arise from the sale of their products that incorporate porex components to  or the use of such products by  end users 
while porex generally seeks contractual indemnification from its customers  any such indemnification is limited  as a practical matter  to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party 
if porex does not have adequate contractual indemnification available  product liability claims  to the extent not covered by insurance  could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
since march  porex has been named as one of many co defendants in a number of actions brought by recipients of mammary implants distributed by porex in the united states 
for a description of these actions  see the information under legal proceedings porex mammary implant litigation 
economic  political and other risks associated with porex s international sales and geographically diverse operations could adversely affect porex s operations and results since porex sells its products worldwide  its business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
in addition  porex has manufacturing assets in the united kingdom  germany and malaysia 
accordingly  porex s operations and financial results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  
table of contents potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  difficulties in managing international and geographically diverse operations  differing protection of intellectual property  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
environmental regulation could adversely affect porex s business porex is subject to foreign and domestic environmental laws and regulations and is subject to scheduled and random checks by environmental authorities 
porex s business involves the handling  storage and disposal of materials that are classified as hazardous 
although porex s safety procedures for handling  storage and disposal of these materials are designed to comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations  porex may be held liable for any environmental damages that result from porex s operations 
porex may be required to pay fines  remediation costs and damages  which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
risks applicable to our entire company we face significant competition for our products and services the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive  continually evolving and  in some cases  subject to rapid technological change 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we do 
these organizations may be better known than we are and have more customers than we do 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations or any alliances they have formed or may form 
for more information about the competition we face  see competition for our healthcare information services and technology solutions beginning on page and porex competition beginning on page the performance of our businesses depends on attracting and retaining qualified executives and employees our performance depends on attracting and retaining key personnel  including executives  product managers  software developers and other technical personnel and sales and marketing personnel 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our business and the results of our operations 
we may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights our intellectual property is important to all of our businesses 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures and non disclosure contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
we believe that our non patented proprietary technologies and business and manufacturing processes are protected under trade secret  contractual and other intellectual property rights 
however  those rights do not afford the statutory exclusivity provided by patented processes 
in addition  the steps that we take to protect our intellectual property  proprietary information and trade secrets may prove to be inadequate and  whether or not adequate  may be expensive 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect potential or actual misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property  proprietary information or trade secrets 
even if we detect misappropriation or infringement by a third party  there can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce our rights at a reasonable cost  or at all 
in addition  our rights to intellectual property  proprietary information and trade secrets may not prevent independent third party development and commercialization of competing products or services 

table of contents third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products we could be subject to claims that we are misappropriating or infringing intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive to defend and divert management s attention from our operations 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing these rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the products or services that use or contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing products or services or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we may also be required to indemnify our customers if they become subject to third party claims relating to intellectual property that we license or otherwise provide to them 
we have incurred and may continue to incur losses we began operations in january and have incurred net losses from operations in each year since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of billion 
although we generated net income  determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  in the quarter ended september   we incurred a net loss for the year ended december  we currently intend to continue to invest in infrastructure development  applications development  sales and marketing  and acquisitions in order to execute on our business plan and whether we continue to incur losses in a particular period will depend on  among other things  the amount of such investments and whether those investments lead to increased revenues 
we may be subject to litigation our business and operations may subject us to claims  litigation and other proceedings brought by private parties and governmental authorities 
for information regarding certain proceedings to which we are currently a party  see legal proceedings beginning on page business combinations and other transactions may be difficult to complete and  if completed  may have negative consequences for our business and our securityholders we intend to seek to acquire or to engage in business combinations with companies engaged in complementary businesses 
in addition  we may enter into joint ventures  strategic alliances or similar arrangements with third parties 
these transactions may result in changes in the nature and scope of our operations and changes in our financial condition 
our success in completing these types of transactions will depend on  among other things  our ability to locate suitable candidates and negotiate mutually acceptable terms with them  as well as the availability of financing 
significant competition for these opportunities exists  which may increase the cost of and decrease the opportunities for these types of transactions 
financing for these transactions may come from several sources  including cash and cash equivalents on hand and marketable securities  proceeds from the incurrence of indebtedness  and proceeds from the issuance of additional common stock  preferred stock  convertible debt or other securities 
our issuance of additional securities could cause substantial dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders at the time of the issuance  cause substantial dilution of our earnings per share  and adversely affect the prevailing market price for our outstanding securities 

table of contents we do not intend to seek securityholder approval for any such acquisition or security issuance unless required by applicable law or regulation or the terms of existing securities 
our business will suffer if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or to assess the risks in particular transactions we have in the past acquired  and may in the future acquire  businesses  technologies  services  product lines and other assets 
the successful integration of the acquired businesses and assets into our operations  on a cost effective basis  can be critical to our future performance 
the amount and timing of the expected benefits of any acquisition are subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those relating to our ability to maintain relationships with the customers of the acquired business  our ability to cross sell products and services to customers with which we have established relationships and those with which the acquired business has established relationships  our ability to retain or replace key personnel  potential conflicts in payer  provider  strategic partner  sponsor or advertising relationships  our ability to coordinate organizations that are geographically diverse and may have different business cultures  and compliance with regulatory requirements 
we cannot guarantee that any acquired businesses will be successfully integrated with our operations in a timely or cost effective manner  or at all 
failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or to achieve anticipated operating synergies  revenue enhancements or cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although our management attempts to evaluate the risks inherent in each transaction and to value acquisition candidates appropriately  we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain all such risks or that acquired businesses and assets will perform as we expect or enhance the value of our company as a whole 
in addition  acquired companies or businesses may have larger than expected liabilities that are not covered by the indemnification  if any  we are able to obtain from the seller 
we may not be able to raise additional funds when needed for our business or to exploit opportunities our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the success of the integration of our businesses  our existing and new applications and service offerings  competing technologies and market developments  potential future acquisitions and additional repurchases of our common stock 
we may need to raise additional funds to support expansion  develop new or enhanced applications and services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
if required  we may raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity  while at the same time maximizing the yield we receive from our investment portfolio 
this objective is accomplished by adherence to our investment policy  which establishes the list of eligible types of securities and credit requirements for each investment 
changes in prevailing interest rates will cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities in commercial paper  non government debt securities  money market funds and highly liquid united states treasury notes 
we view these high grade securities within our portfolio as having similar market risk characteristics 
principal amounts expected to mature are million  million and million during  and  respectively 
these include investments totaling million in federal agency notes that are callable subjecting us to interest rate risk on the reinvestment of these securities 
we believe that the impact of any call and resulting reinvestment of proceeds would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have not utilized derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
exchange rate sensitivity currently  substantially all of our sales and expenses are denominated in united states dollars  however  porex is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the rate of exchange of the united states dollar against the euro 
this exposure arises primarily as a result of translating the results of porex s foreign operations to the united states dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the accounting period 
porex has not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date 
foreign currency translation gains losses were million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
we believe that future exchange rate sensitivity related to porex will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations
