item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
please read forward looking information on page we operate in one segment  natural gas and oil exploration and development 
overview our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms 
price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years 
in early  the nymex futures market reported unprecedented natural gas contract prices 
we benefited from this market with our realized natural gas price reaching per mcf in december and per mcf in january when the nymex futures market was near its high on the last day of december  we entered into a series of price collars that protected us from the subsequent price decline until their expiration in october see the commodity price swaps and options discussion about hedging on page these price collar arrangements boosted revenue by million  increasing the average realized natural gas price by per mcf 
in  natural gas prices rose throughout the year beginning with a per mcf price in january and ending with a december realized price of per mcf 
this pattern is contrary to the pattern of prices declining throughout the year as seen in the tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated over the course of and index represents the henry hub index price per mmbtu 
the and price is the natural gas price per mcf realized by us and it includes the impact of the natural gas price collar or swap arrangements natural gas prices by month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec index natural gas prices by month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec index prices for crude oil have followed a similar path as the commodity market fell through and rose during the tables below contain the west texas intermediate index price index and our realized per bbl crude oil prices by month for and in per bbl crude oil prices by month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec index in per bbl crude oil prices by month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec index we reported earnings of per share  or million  for this is down from the per share  or million  reported in the weaker price environment coupled with the impact of our hedge arrangements were the driving factors in this decline 
prices  including the impact of the hedge arrangements  fell for natural gas and for oil 
partially offsetting this negative price impact  natural gas production was up and crude oil sales volumes were up from last year 
overall  on a mcfe basis  our production grew more than over an production increase was a result of the full year impact of the acquisition of cody company  which was effective august   and the remaining resulted from our drilling activities 
we drilled gross wells with a success rate of in compared to gross wells and an success rate in total capital expenditures were million in compared to million for  which included million in cash and million in common stock paid for cody company 
capital spent in drilling activity decreased million from  which remains our largest capital program to date 
in previous years  our capital spending  excluding major acquisitions  used substantially all of our operating cash flow 
in  our capital and exploration expenditures were under this level  allowing us the reduce debt by million 
our strategy in is anticipated to remain consistent with we believe our operating cash flow in will be sufficient to fund our capital and exploration budgeted spending of million and again provide excess cash flow to reduce debt 
at the end of  our debt to total capitalization ratio was  an improvement from at the end of this improvement was primarily the result of the decrease in debt levels and occurred despite a million reduction in the other comprehensive income portion of equity 
during  we improved our debt to total capitalization ratio from at the end of to at the close of this improvement was a result of several significant accomplishments 
we sold million shares of common stock in may for net proceeds of million  of which million was used to repurchase all of our preferred stock 
the remaining proceeds  along with another million from employee stock option exercises  were used to reduce debt and pay dividends 
from year end to year end  we reduced debt by million 
we remain focused on our strategies to grow through the drill bit  balancing the higher risk higher reward exploration opportunities with an extensive development program  and from synergistic acquisitions 
we plan to remain disciplined in our capital program while providing for growth potential 
we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment  enabling us to add shareholder value over the long term 
the preceding paragraphs  discussing our strategic pursuits and goals  contain forward looking information 
please read forward looking information on page financial condition capital resources and liquidity our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and gas properties and asset based borrowing supported by oil and gas reserves 
our level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors  including the price of natural gas and oil  our ability to find and produce hydrocarbons and our ability to control and reduce costs 
demand for natural gas has historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season 
however  in the summer of  our realized gas prices began to climb to unseasonably high levels and by january  we realized the highest prices in the company s history 
then in  our realized natural gas price declined throughout the year to a low of per mcf in december 
in  commodity prices rose throughout the year  with december s realized natural gas price up from the january price 
a mild winter and the economic recession may have been contributing factors in the pricing volatility  while a colder winter and the threat of potential military activity in the middle east may have contributed to rising prices in the primary sources of cash during were funds generated from operations and  to a lesser extent  proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets and the sale of stock 
funds were used primarily for exploration and development expenditures  reductions to the level of borrowing on the revolving credit facility  and dividend payments 
we had a net cash outflow of million during the net cash inflow from operating activities of million was sufficient to fund the million of cash used for capital and exploration expenditures and million of the reduction to debt 
cash proceeds from the sales of non strategic assets and the sale of stock combined to provide an additional million of cash flow 
in millions cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities in were million lower than in this decrease was the result of lower realized commodity prices combined with both an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable 
cash flows provided by operating activities in were million higher than in this improvement was primarily a result of increased revenues from higher realized commodity prices and to a lesser extent to increased natural gas and oil production 
in millions cash flows used by investing activities cash flows used by investing activities in were attributable to capital and exploration expenditures of million  offset by the receipt of million in proceeds received from the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties 
cash flows used by investing activities in included the million cash portion of the cody company acquisition 
additionally  capital spending for drilling and facilities increased million  or  from to million 
we drilled gross wells  which represents a increase over cash flows used by investing activities in were attributable to capital and exploration expenditures of million  offset by the receipt of million in proceeds received from the sale of non strategic oil and gas properties 
in millions cash flows provided used by financing activities cash flows used by financing activities in included million used to reduce the year end debt balance to million from million in and cash used to pay cash dividends to stockholders 
cash flows provided by financing activities in included the impact of issuing million in a private placement of notes in july used to partially fund the cody company acquisition 
partially offsetting this debt increase was the reduction to the balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility and the may prepayment of million in debt that was due in may cash flows provided by financing activities in included million in proceeds received from the sale of common stock  both in a block trade and through the exercise of employee stock options 
of the proceeds  million was used to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of preferred stock 
additional cash used in financing activities included million used to reduce the year end debt balance to million from million in and cash used to pay dividends to stockholders 
we have a revolving credit facility with a group of banks  the revolving term of which runs to october the available credit line under this facility  currently million  is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks petroleum engineer and other assets 
accordingly  oil and gas prices are an important part of this computation 
since the current price environment remains volatile  management can not predict how future price levels may change the banks long term price outlook 
to reduce the impact of any redetermination  we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity 
at year end  this excess capacity totaled million  or of the total available credit line 
management believes it has the ability to finance  if necessary  our capital requirements  including acquisitions 
oil and gas prices also affect the calculation of the financial ratios for debt covenant compliance 
please read note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our revolving credit facility 
in the event that the available credit line is adjusted below the outstanding level of borrowings  we have a period of three months to reduce our outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line with a requirement to provide additional borrowing base assets or pay down one third of the excess during each of the three months 
our interest expense is expected to be approximately million  including interest on the million weighted average fixed rate notes used to partially fund the acquisition of cody company 
capitalization our capitalization information is as follows as of december  in millions long term debt current portion of long term debt total debt stockholders equity common stock net of treasury stock total equity total capitalization debt to capitalization during  dividends were paid on our common stock totaling million 
we have paid quarterly common stock dividends of per share since becoming publicly traded in the amount of future dividends is determined by our board of directors and is dependent upon a number of factors  including future earnings  financial condition and capital requirements 
in may  we bought back all of the shares of preferred stock from the holder for million 
since this stock had been recorded at a stated value of million on our balance sheet  we realized a negative dividend to preferred stockholders of million 
we received net proceeds of million from the sale of million shares of common stock in a public offering primarily to fund this transaction 
after repurchasing the preferred stock  the excess proceeds were used to reduce debt 
capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis  we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities  excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations 
we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 
the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december  in millions capital expenditures drilling and facilities leasehold acquisitions pipeline and gathering other proved property acquisitions exploration expenses total the amount includes the million common stock component of the cody acquisition and excludes the million deferred tax gross up 
see note  cody acquisition 
total capital and exploration expenditures for decreased million compared to the spending in included the million cody acquisition 
the remaining million of the decrease was due to smaller drilling and geological and geophysical programs for in  we drilled gross wells compared to gross wells drilled in representing a decline in drilling activity 
also  the drilling program included a million increase in geological and geophysical expenses over  including costs of obtaining seismic data that supports future drilling programs 
we plan to drill gross wells in compared with gross wells drilled in this drilling program includes million in total capital and exploration expenditures  up from million in expected spending in includes million for drilling and dry hole exposure  million for lease acquisition and million in geological and geophysical expenses 
in addition to the drilling and exploration program  other capital expenditures are planned primarily for production equipment and for gathering and pipeline infrastructure maintenance and construction 
we will continue to assess the commodity price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly so as to not jeopardize our economic returns 
contractual obligations we are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types on contracts note agreements and leases 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that we were obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  payments due by year in thousands total to to beyond long term debt     operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      million of the amount shown as scheduled for payment in represents the december  balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
typically  we are able to replace this credit agreement with a new one as this comes due 
see discussion in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of operating leases can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have no capital leases 
potential impact of our critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the three most significant policies are discussed below 
commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results 
in particular  substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 
the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
however  management may mitigate this price risk with the use of financial instruments 
most recently  we have used financial instruments such as price collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue 
under both arrangements  there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in the company not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement 
we covered of our production in with natural gas price collar arrangements and prices rose above the ceiling during some months 
if we had not had these collars in place in  our realized natural gas price would have been per mcf higher 
in  we covered of our natural gas production with price collar arrangements and prices were below the floor for several months 
the gains from the price collars improved our annual realized natural gas price by per mcf 
during  we hedged of our natural gas production with a combination of price swaps and collars 
the impact of these hedges reduced our realized natural gas price by per mcf 
also in  of our crude oil production was hedged with a series of price collars 
the impact of these hedges reduced our realized crude oil price by per bbl in successful efforts method of accounting we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
under this method  acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred 
exploration costs  including seismic purchases and processing  exploratory dry hole drilling costs and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
during  we drilled nine exploratory wells and three of them were unsuccessful  adding million to exploration expense 
additionally  we abandoned certain sections of exploration well bores that were not economical  in the amount of million 
this success rate for exploratory wells is higher than our historical rate  and as we focus more on our exploration program  we are exposed to the risk of dry hole expense 
development costs  including the costs to drill and equip development wells  and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 
we are also exposed to potential impairments if the book value of our assets exceeds their future expected cash flows 
this may occur if a field discovers lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field 
we determine if an impairment has occurred through either adverse changes or as a result of the annual review of all fields 
the impairment of unamortized capital costs is measured at a lease level and is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected future net cash flows is less than the net book value 
for the year ended december   and we had impairment of long lived asset expense of million  million  and million  respectively 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain  and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysic  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of 
the quality and quantity of available data  
the interpretation of that data  
the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and 
the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this document is based on estimates we prepared 
estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
our rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves 
if the estimates of proved reserves declines  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
in addition  the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  when adopted 
operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks  including 
blowouts  cratering and explosions  
mechanical problems  
uncontrolled flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  
fires  
formations with abnormal pressures  
pollution and other environmental risks  and 
natural disasters 
the operation of our natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks  including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures 
the location of pipelines near populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites  could increase these risks 
any of these events could result in loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution  impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses 
the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate 
during the past few years  we have drilled a higher percentage of our wells in the gulf coast  where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the east 
other issues and contingencies corporate income tax 
we generate tax credits for the production of certain qualified fuels  including natural gas produced from tight sands formations and devonian shale 
the credit for natural gas from a tight sand formation tight gas sands amounts to per mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to from qualified wells drilled in and a number of wells drilled in the eastern region and rocky mountains during and qualified for the tight gas sands tax credit 
the credit for natural gas produced from devonian shale is estimated to be per mmbtu in in and  we completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits  resulting in revenues of million in the tax credit wells were repurchased in december and therefore  no monetization revenue will be realized in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of the act 
the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions 
the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after the repeal of the excess idc preference can not reduce a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income by more than of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 
regulations 
our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
see regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation and environmental regulations in the other business matters section of item business for a discussion of these regulations 
restrictive covenants 
our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the company s various debt instruments 
among other requirements  our revolving credit agreement and the notes see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of to at december   the calculated ratio for was to on both the revolving credit agreement and the notes 
in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants  the company may apply for a temporary waiver with the bank  which  if granted  would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 
see further discussion in capital resources and liquidity and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
limited partnership 
as part of the cody acquisition  we acquired a interest in certain oil and gas properties in the kurten field  as general partner of a partnership and as an operator 
our current interest in kurten is approximately  including a one percent interest in the partnership 
under the partnership agreement  we have the right to a reversionary working interest that would bring our ultimate interest to upon the limited partner reaching payout 
under the partnership agreement  the limited partner has the sole option to trigger a liquidation of the partnership 
effective february   the kurten partnership commenced liquidation at the limited partner s election 
in connection with the liquidation  an appraisal has been obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets 
based on the receipt of the appraisal in february  we would not receive the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation 
due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the kurten field  the limited partners decision and our decision to proceed with the liquidation  we performed an impairment review which resulted in an after tax charge of approximately million 
this impairment charge will be reflected in the first quarter of as an operating expense but will not impact the company s cash flows 
in addition  we will record a downward reserve revision of approximately bcfe as a result of the loss of the reversionary interest 
conclusion our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and oil and our ability to market gas on economically attractive terms 
the average produced natural gas sales price received by us  including the impact of derivatives  has changed from year to year as follows decreased from to per mcf increased over to per mcf increased over to per mcf increased over to per mcf decreased from to per mcf increased over to per mcf the volatility of natural gas prices in recent years remains prevalent in with wide price swings in day to day trading on the nymex futures market 
given this continued price volatility  we can not predict what pricing levels will be in the future 
because future cash flows are subject to these variables  there is no assurance that our operations will provide cash sufficient to fully fund our planned capital expenditures 
for these reasons  we periodically use derivative instruments to manage some of the price volatility 
while our plan now includes million in capital and exploration spending  we will periodically assess industry conditions and adjust our spending plan to ensure the adequate funding of our capital requirements  including  if necessary  reductions in capital and exploration expenditures or common stock dividends 
we plan on remaining disciplined in our capital program 
we believe our capital resources  supplemented with external financing if necessary  are adequate to meet our capital requirements 
the preceding paragraphs contain forward looking information 
see forward looking information on page recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb approved for issuance sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets  including the timing of the liability recognition  initial measurement of the liability  allocation of asset retirement cost to expense  subsequent measurement of the liability and financial statement disclosures 
sfas requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
the adoption of sfas resulted in an increase of total liabilities  because more retirement obligations are required to be recognized  an increase in the recognized cost of assets  because the retirement costs are added to the carrying amount of the long lived asset and an increase in operating expense  because of the accretion of the retirement obligation and additional depreciation and depletion 
the majority of the asset retirement obligations recorded by the company relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells 
the company adopted the statement on january  the transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of sfas will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in january the impact on the financial statements of adopting sfas is disclosed in note  adoption of sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  to the financial statements 
in august  the fasb also approved sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas replaces sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the new accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations  and replaces the provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  for the disposal of segments of a business 
sfas requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
sfas also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and  were adopted by the company in the adoption of this statement did not impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after may   provides guidance for income statement classification of gains and losses on extinguishment of debt and accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
the adoption of this statement did not impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas nullifies the guidance of the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas are required for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of this statement did not impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on the reported results 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of this statement did not impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
see note  capital stock  to the financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin or interpretation 
fin is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vie s 
the primary objective of the interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  such entities are known as vie s 
the interpretation requires an enterprise to consolidate a vie if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
an enterprise shall consider the rights and obligations conveyed by its variable interests in making this determination 
this guidance applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  at this time we have only one entity that could potentially be a vie 
we are evaluating this potential vie  in which we have a one percent general partner interest and that holds an interest in the kurten field  to determine if it is a vie 
however  pursuant to the partnership agreement  the limited partner has elected to liquidate the partnership 
it is anticipated that this liquidation will be completed prior to the effective date of the interpretation

results of operations for the purpose of reviewing our results of operations  net income is defined as net income available to common stockholders 
selected financial and operating data in millions except where specified operating revenues operating expenses operating income interest expense net income earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted natural gas production bcf gulf coast west east total company produced natural gas sales price mcf gulf coast west east total company crude condensate volume mbbl   price bbl and compared net income and revenues 
during  we reported net income of million  or per share 
operating income decreased million  or  and operating revenues decreased million  or  in the decrease in operating revenues was mainly a result of the million decline in natural gas sales due to the decrease in natural gas prices and the million decrease in brokered natural gas sales revenue  which was also a result of lower prices 
natural gas revenue and our realized price were reduced by million due to hedges in place during see further discussion in item a 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in crude oil revenue of million due to a increase in the volume of crude oil produced 
operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes 
the average gulf coast natural gas production sales price declined per mcf  or  to  decreasing operating revenues by approximately million 
in the western region  the average natural gas production sales price decreased per mcf  or  to  decreasing operating revenues by approximately million 
the average eastern natural gas production sales price decreased per mcf  or  to  decreasing operating revenues by approximately million 
the overall weighted average natural gas production sales price decreased per mcf  or  to per mcf in natural gas production volume in the gulf coast region was up bcf  or  to bcf primarily due to production from our discoveries in south louisiana and production from the cody company properties acquired in august natural gas production volume in the western region was down bcf  or  to bcf due primarily to a decline in drilling activity  offset slightly by a increase in the success rate 
natural gas production volume in the eastern region was up bcf  or  to bcf  as a result increased drilling activity in the region over the past year 
total natural gas production was up bcf  or  in crude oil prices fell per bbl  or  to  resulting in a decrease to operating revenues of approximately million 
the volume of crude oil sold in the year rose by to  mbbls  increasing operating revenues by million 
this production increase was a result of our and drilling success in south louisiana of the increase and the acquisition of cody company of the increase 
brokered natural gas revenue decreased million  or  from the prior year 
the sales price of brokered natural gas declined  resulting in a decrease in revenue of million 
the volume of natural gas brokered this year declined by  reducing revenues by million 
in prior years  the revenues and expenses related to brokering natural gas were reported net on the consolidated statement of operations as brokered natural gas margin 
beginning in  these amounts are reported gross as part of operating revenues and operating expenses 
after including the related brokered natural gas costs  we realized a brokered gas margin of million in compared to a brokered gas margin of million in other operating revenues decreased million to million 
in  we provided for payout liabilities on certain properties not operated by us and certain estimated potential legal settlements 
costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses from operations decreased million  or  from due primarily to the following 
brokered natural gas cost decreased million  or  primarily due to the million impact of decreased natural gas costs per mcf 
volumes of brokered gas purchases decreased slightly contributing further to a reduction in the amount of million 

production and pipeline expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of a full year of costs associated with operating the cody company properties acquired in august additionally  increased insurance costs and increased drilling activity in the gulf coast and rockies contributed to the rise in expense 
on a units of production basis  our company wide production and pipeline expense was per mcfe in versus per mcfe in 
exploration expense decreased million  or  primarily as a result of the following 
an million decrease in geological and geophysical expenses over last year due to the unusually high acquisition of seismic data for future evaluation 

a million decrease in dry hole costs 
in  we drilled nine exploratory wells compared to in our success rate on these wells improved from in to in the million in dry hole cost recognized in includes expenditures related to three wells from the drilling program determined to be dry in  in the amount of million  as well as costs of abandoning certain sections of exploration well bores that were not economical  in the amount of million 

a million increase for salaries  wages and related benefits largely attributable to increased staffing in the gulf coast region during to support that year s expanded drilling program and assimilating cody 

depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of unproved properties expense increased million  or  over natural gas equivalent production increased  increasing dd a expense by million 
the increase in the per unit expense from per mcfe to per mcfe was a result of increased production in the higher cost gulf coast region including a full year impact of the newly acquired cody properties and resulted in an million increase to dd a expense for 
impairment of long lived assets decreased by million this year 
this year we recorded impairments on four small fields  three of which were in the gulf coast and one in the rocky mountains 
for each of these fields  the capitalized cost exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows 
a pipeline in the eastern region was written down to fair market value 
last year  two fields in the gulf coast region were impaired since the cost capitalized exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows 
also in  one natural gas processing plant in the rocky mountains area was written down to fair market value 
in the fourth quarter of  the starpath prospect in the gulf coast region was impaired 

general and administrative expenses increased million due to the costs associated with the retirement of the chief executive officer in may 
taxes other than income decreased million as a result of lower natural gas and oil revenues 
interest expense increased million due to the full year impact of the incremental debt used to partially fund the cody acquisition in august interest expense on the credit facility was down slightly due both to lower levels of borrowings and lower interest rates 
income tax expense was down million due to the comparable decrease in earnings before income tax 
our effective tax rate decreased slightly in reflecting a shift of activity between states 
and compared net income and revenues 
we reported net income in of million  or per share 
during  we reported net income of million  or per share 
operating income increased million  or  and operating revenues increased million  or  in the improvement in operating revenues was mainly a result of the million rise in natural gas sales due to the increases in both natural gas prices and production  and the million increase in crude oil sales revenue 
in our natural gas revenue and our realized price were bolstered by the use of collar arrangements resulting in a per mcf increase to our realized natural gas price 
see further discussion in item a 
these improvements were partially offset by a decline in brokered natural gas volume that reduced operating revenues by million 
operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes 
the average gulf coast natural gas production sales price rose per mcf  or  to  increasing operating revenues by approximately million 
in the western region  the average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing operating revenues by approximately million 
the average appalachian natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to  increasing operating revenues by approximately million 
the overall weighted average natural gas production sales price increased per mcf  or  to per mcf in natural gas production volume in the gulf coast region was up bcf  or  to bcf primarily due to production from our discoveries in south louisiana and production from the cody company properties acquired in august natural gas production volume in the western region was down bcf  or  to bcf due primarily to lower levels of drilling activity in the mid continent area during the past three years 
natural gas production volume in the appalachian region was down bcf  or  to bcf  as a result of lower than anticipated success of the oriskany drilling program in the region in late and into total natural gas production was up bcf  or  in crude oil prices fell per bbl  or  to  resulting in a decrease to operating revenues of approximately million 
the volume of crude oil sold in the year doubled to  mbbls  increasing operating revenues by million 
this production increase was a result of our drilling success in south louisiana increase and the acquisition of cody company increase 
brokered natural gas revenue decreased million  or  from the prior year 
the sales price of brokered natural gas rose  resulting in an increase in revenue of million 
the volume of natural gas brokered this year declined by  reducing revenues by million 
after including the related brokered natural gas costs  we realized a net margin of million in compared to a net margin of million in other operating revenues decreased million to million 
in  we received a million settlement as a result of a lawsuit 
in  we realized miscellaneous net revenue of approximately million primarily from the settlement of a natural gas sales contract 
costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses from operations increased million  or  from due primarily to the following 
brokered natural gas cost decreased million  or  primarily due to the million impact of the lower volume of brokered sales in this was partially offset by a million increase due to higher natural gas costs compared to the prior year 

production and pipeline expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of costs associated with operating the cody company properties acquired in august additionally  increased staffing and insurance costs were incurred to support the expanded drilling program 
the expense includes million related to the closure of the region office in pittsburgh 
on a units of production basis  our company wide production and pipeline expense was per mcfe in versus per mcfe in as a result of the increased production discussed above 

exploration expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of the following 
a million increase in geological and geophysical expenses over last year due to the acquisition of seismic data for future evaluation and increased drilling activity in all regions 

a million increase in dry hole costs 
although the drilling success rate improved from in to in  we drilled a total of gross wells in  a increase over we recorded seven exploratory dry holes in the higher cost gulf coast region versus only two in we also recorded four exploratory dry holes in the rocky mountains area and seven in the appalachian region for a total of  up from a company total of seven in 
a million increase for salaries  wages and incentive compensation largely attributable to increased staffing in the gulf coast region to support the expanded drilling program 

depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment expense increased million  or  over natural gas equivalent production increased  increasing dd a expense by million 
the increase in the per unit expense from per mcfe to per mcfe was a result of increased production in the higher cost gulf coast region including the newly acquired cody properties and resulted in an million increase to dd a expense for 
impairment of long lived assets decreased million from in  two fields in the gulf coast region were impaired since the cost capitalized exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows 
also in  one natural gas processing plant in the rocky mountains area was written down to fair market value 
in the fourth quarter of  the starpath prospect in the gulf coast region was impaired 
during  we recorded a million impairment on one field in the gulf coast due to casing collapse in two of the field s wells 

general and administrative expenses increased million  primarily as a result of increased staffing during the transition period following the cody company acquisition and other staffing increases that support our larger operations 
additional cost increases were realized in incentive compensation programs as well as technology updates and related software maintenance 

taxes other than income increased million as a result of higher natural gas and oil revenues 
interest expense decreased million due to a lower weighted average interest rate realized in this was despite the new notes issued to partially fund the acquisition of cody company in august income tax expense was up million due to the comparable increase in earnings before income tax

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk oil and gas prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
oil and gas prices declined substantially in and early  moved higher through and into before declining back to year end levels in october prices continued to decline for the remainder of from the end of through half of oil and gas prices were constant with an increase in prices during the fourth quarter 
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly significant impact on our financial results 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include 
the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas 

the level of consumer product demand 

weather conditions 

political conditions in oil producing regions  including the middle east 

the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls 

the price of foreign imports 

actions of governmental authorities 

domestic and foreign governmental regulations 

the price  availability and acceptance of alternative fuels 

overall economic conditions 
these factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil and gas 
our hedging policy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil markets 
a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management overseas our hedging activity 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and gas prices 
these hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices 
please read the discussion below related to commodity price swaps and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 
commodity price swaps and options hedges on production swaps from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
under these price swaps  we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index  such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 
under our revolving credit agreement  the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed of the anticipated future production during the period covered by the hedges 
we did not have crude oil swap arrangements covering our production in   or during  we fixed the price at an average of per mcf on quantities totaling  bcf  representing of our natural gas production 
during  we fixed the price at an average of per mcf on quantities totaling mmcf  representing approximately of our natural gas production 
during  we fixed the price at an average of per mcf on quantities totaling mmcf  representing less than of our natural gas production 
as of the years ended december   and  we had no crude oil swap contracts that qualified as hedges outstanding 
we had open natural gas price swap contracts on our production as follows natural gas price swaps volume weighted unrealized in average loss contract period mmcf contract price in millions as of december  natural gas price swaps on production in first quarter of  second quarter of  third quarter of  fourth quarter of  full year of   first quarter of  second quarter of  third quarter of  fourth quarter of  full year of   as of december  none natural gas price swaps increased revenue by million in and reduced revenue by million in from time to time we enter into crude oil range swaps with counterparties 
these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas and are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date 
we entered into two crude oil range swap arrangements as follows 
a fixed price swap at per barrel  unless the nymex west texas intermediate monthly average price falls below per barrel 
if the nymex west texas intermediate monthly average price falls below per barrel for any month  the swap is cancelled for that month 
this instrument covers mbbls of production over the period january through december 
a fixed price swap at per barrel  unless the nymex west texas intermediate monthly average price falls below per barrel 
if the nymex west texas intermediate monthly average price falls below per barrel for any month  the swap is cancelled for that month 
this instrument covers mbbls of production over the period july through december the crude oil range swaps at december  had a pre tax unrealized loss in the amount of million  which is reflected in crude oil operating revenue  and covered approximately of our anticipated crude oil production during this period 
we had no crude oil range swap contracts outstanding during in january  we entered into a natural gas swap arrangement to reduce the price risk on an additional portion of our production 
the swap arrangement is in place for the months of february through december with a fixed price of per mcf 
this hedge covers  mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the year 
hedges on production options in december and march  we believed that the pricing environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our production through the use of a series of collars 
under the collar arrangements  if the index rises above the ceiling price  we pay the counterparty 
if the applicable index falls below the floor  the counterparty pays us 
the natural gas price hedges include several collar arrangements based on nine price indexes 
the first series of natural gas price collars were in place for the months of january through april with a weighted average price floor of per mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of per mcf 
these hedges covered  mmcf  or of our natural gas production for the year 
the second series of natural gas price collars were in place for the months of may through august with a weighted average price floor of per mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of per mcf 
these hedges covered  mmcf  or of our natural gas production for the year 
all indexes were within the collars during the month of january  all were below the floor for february through march  and most were above the ceiling in april through august  resulting in a cash expenditure of million for the year 
overall  the natural gas collar and swap arrangements resulted in a reduction of per mcf to our average realized natural gas price for during  we used several costless collar arrangements to hedge a portion of our natural gas production 
the natural gas price hedges include several costless collar arrangements based on eight price indexes at which we sell a portion of our production 
these hedges were in place for the months of february through october and covered  mmcf  or  of our natural gas production for the year 
all indexes were within the collars during february and april  some fell below the floor during the period of march  and all indexes were below the floor from june through october  resulting in a million cash revenue for the year 
these gains contributed per mcf to our average realized natural gas price for again in august  we believed that the pricing environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our production through the use of natural gas price collar arrangements 
as of the years ended december   and  we had open natural gas price collar contracts on our production as follows natural gas price collars volume weighted unrealized in average loss contract period mmcf ceiling floor in millions as of december  natural gas collars on production in first quarter of  second quarter of  third quarter of  fourth quarter of  full year of   as of december  natural gas costless collars on production in first quarter of  second quarter of  full year of  the natural gas price collars open at december   noted above  included several collar arrangements based on two price indexes at which we sell a portion of our production 
these hedges are in place for the full year of and cover approximately of our anticipated natural gas production during this period 
we also have crude oil collars open at december  these hedges are in place for the months of january through june with a weighted average price floor of and a weighted average price ceiling of 
these hedges cover approximately of our anticipated crude oil production during this period 
crude oil collars reduced revenue by million during  but had no impact on results 
subsequent to year end we entered into a series of natural gas costless collar and natural gas and crude oil price swap arrangements to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our and production 
these arrangements are as follows 
a natural gas costless collar in place for the months of february through december with a weighted average price floor of per mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of per mcf 
this hedge covers  mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the year 

a natural gas costless collar in place for the full year of with a weighted average price floor of per mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of per mcf 
this hedge covers  mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the year 

a natural gas costless collar in place for the full year of with a weighted average price floor of per mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of per mcf 
this hedge covers  mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the year 

a natural gas costless collar in place for the months of march through december with a weighted average price floor of per mcf and a weighted average price ceiling of per mcf 
this hedge covers  mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the year 

a natural gas price swap in place for the months of march through december with a fixed price of per mcf 
this hedge covers  mmcf of our anticipated natural gas production for the year 

a fixed price swap at per barrel  unless the nymex west texas intermediate monthly average price falls below per barrel 
if the nymex west texas intermediate monthly average price falls below per barrel for any month  the swap is cancelled for that month 
this instrument covers mbbls of production over the period july through december adoption of sfas we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  on january  under sfas  the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at the end of each period  these instruments are marked to market 
the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as other comprehensive income  a component of equity  to the extent that the derivative instrument is an effective hedge 
under sfas  effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale 
for example  a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated  and effective  if the underlying gas were sold at the henry hub index 
any portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the sfas test are recorded immediately as a component of operating revenue on the statement of operations 
when we adopted sfas  we had two types of hedges in place 
the first type was a cash flow hedge that set the price of a certain monthly quantity of natural gas sold in the gulf coast region through september based on the index price strip  the impact of this hedge on january  was to record a hedge loss of million and a charge to other comprehensive income of million 
correspondingly  a hedge liability for million was established 
this instrument was cancelled in december with the bankruptcy of the counterparty 
no balance related to this hedge remains in other comprehensive income 
the second type of hedge outstanding at january  was a natural gas price costless collar agreement 
we had entered into eight of these collars for a portion of our production at regional indexes for the months of february through october the collars had two components of value intrinsic value and time value 
under sfas  both components were valued at the end of each reporting period 
intrinsic value arises when the index price is either above the ceiling or below the floor for any period covered by the collar 
if the index is above the ceiling for any month covered by the collar  the intrinsic value would be the difference between the index and the ceiling prices multiplied by the notional volume 
in accordance with the initial sfas guidance  intrinsic value related to the current month would be recorded as a hedge loss if the index is above the ceiling or gain if the index is below the floor 
starting in under amended guidance on sfas  any changes in the intrinsic value component related to future months were recorded in other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity on the balance sheet  rather than to the income statement to the extent that the hedge was proven to be effective 
these natural gas price collars were considered to be highly effective with respect to the intrinsic value calculation  since they were tied to the same indexes at which our natural gas is sold 
also under sfas  the time value component  a market premium discount  was marked to market through the income statement each period 
since these collar arrangements were executed on the last business day of  the net premium value at adoption on january  was zero 
as of december   we had a series of nine natural gas price collar arrangements outstanding 
as of december  we had a series of natural gas price swap arrangements  two natural gas price collar arrangements  two crude oil price collar arrangements  and two crude oil swap arrangements outstanding 
in accordance with the latest guidance from the fasb s derivative implementation group  we test the effectiveness of the combined intrinsic and time values and the effective portion of each will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
any ineffective portion will be recorded as a gain or loss in the current period 
as of december   we had recorded million of other comprehensive income million net of deferred taxes  a million unrealized hedge loss in revenue  a million hedge asset  and a million hedge liability  exclusive of the crude oil range swaps 
as of december   we had recorded million of other comprehensive income million net of deferred taxes  a million unrealized hedge gain in revenue and a million hedge asset
