item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations adjustments related to stock option accounting effective in  we retroactively adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock options as outlined in sfas no 
accordingly  all prior periods presented have been restated to reflect compensation cost that would have been recognized under the fair value based accounting method for all options granted  modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  the amounts we previously reported in our annual reports on form k included the tax benefit from stock options exercised as a credit to the provision for income taxes 
this benefit for options exercised should have been recorded as an increase to paid in capital 
accordingly  the amounts previously reported have been adjusted to properly account for this tax benefit 
these adjustments had the effect of reducing net income by   and  for  and  respectively  and reducing both basic and diluted eps by  and for each of these respective years compared to the amounts previously reported in our annual reports on form k 
these non cash tax adjustments to net income have no effect upon our cash flows  ability to pay dividends  current income tax liability or total stockholders equity

financial condition liquidity and financial position our liquidity is influenced primarily by cash flows from operations and by capital expenditures at our utility group for the addition  replacement and renovation of water and wastewater utility facilities 
our capital resources are used for debt service on our bonds and debentures and are also influenced by investments in new business opportunities  including the acquisition of companies  funding of projects and acquisition of contracts 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately  with cash and cash equivalent balances totaling approximately  as well as aggregate lines of credit totaling  consisting of three separate unsecured lines of credit from three commercial banks 
one of the lines of credit expires in march  another expires in april and the remaining line expires in september as of december   we had approximately  outstanding and approximately  available on these three lines of credit 
during  our outstanding line of credit borrowings increased by approximately  we paid for the acquisition of the aquasource business with approximately  in cash 
we paid in full our new mexico utility series a first mortgage bonds in the amount of  and we purchased certain utility property 
these borrowings were offset in part by repayments on our lines of credit with the net proceeds of approximately  from a new bank term loan secured by our texas utility  the cash received as payment for the el paso  texas reverse osmosis plant and from payments received for water quality related reimbursements 
on january   we obtained an additional unsecured line of credit facility in the amount of  from one of our commercial banks 
this facility was used to issue a  standby letter of credit as collateral for performance under the service contract for the cvwd to design and construct a reverse osmosis water treatment facility and associated wells 
this standby letter of credit is in force for the estimated two year construction period of the project 
upon acceptance of the completed project by the cvwd  the standby letter of credit facility will be terminated 
in addition to our lines of credit  we have excess borrowing capacity under our first mortgage bond indentures of approximately  as of december  however  the additional borrowing available under our current commercial lines of credit is limited by financial covenants that restrict additional borrowing at december 
table of contents  to an amount no greater than the remaining unused credit line amount 
accordingly  borrowings were limited to our unused lines of credit of approximately  at december  we expect to maintain our lines of credit in the normal course of business 
each of the line of credit agreements contains certain financial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants of each of the line of credit agreements 
we periodically use our lines of credit to fund large construction projects and or acquisitions 
upon completion of these larger transactions  we have historically obtained a permanent funding source and used the proceeds to restore availability under the lines of credit 
of the  total capacity under our lines of credit  we had approximately  in borrowing capacity as of december  as a result of using approximately  in borrowings on our lines of credit to fund the acquisition of aqua services in november as indicated in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in march  we entered into an agreement to amend one of our lines of credit under which the bank increased our line of credit capacity by  through december  we are currently evaluating our capital structure and potential financing alternatives available to us to provide additional liquidity 
these alternatives include increasing the size of our lines of credit  long term asset backed financing capacity in our regulated utilities  sale and leaseback of certain fleet assets and administrative office space  and issuance of debt or equity in either public or private offerings 
we anticipate that these financing alternatives will enable us to substantially reduce the amounts currently outstanding on our lines of credit 
while we believe that there will be investor and lender interest in these financing alternatives  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such funding in we anticipate that our available line of credit borrowing capacity and cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our activities during the next months 
if we were unable to renew our existing lines of credit  or if we were unable to execute additional financing alternatives  our capital spending and any future acquisitions would be reduced  eliminated or delayed 
while we have the ability to take such actions during  these actions could negatively impact our revenues  revenue growth  and profitability 
during  net cash provided by operations totaled  compared to  in increased cash flows from operations were primarily the result of the collection of significant receivables in connection with the completion of a reverse osmosis water treatment plant constructed by our services group and an increase in accounts payable  primarily for construction related activities 
in addition  we recorded approximately  for certain water quality related expenses incurred in prior years 
our investing activities include company funded acquisitions of plant and equipment as well as acquisitions of operating entities 
property  plant and equipment during  our additions to property  plant and equipment were  consisting of  in company financed additions   in contributions by crs   in developer paid additions and  in non cash property contributed by developers 
company financed capital additions were funded primarily by cash flow from operations and by borrowings on our bank lines of credit 
total additions to property  plant and equipment represented an increase of  compared to additions to property  plant and equipment were primarily utility assets for our utility group  including new wells and transmission lines at our new mexico utility and the construction of a lift station  force main and an elevated storage tank at one of our texas utilities 
in addition  we completed expansion of an office building in austin  texas 
developers made contributions in aid of construction ciac  living unit equivalent lue fees and advances totaling  during  of which  was received in cash and  was received as non cash contributions of property 
we estimate that our total company financed capital additions in will be approximately  primarily for utility plant  and that our cash flows from operations  borrowings on our lines of credit  ciac  lue fees and advances will fund these additions 

table of contents acquisitions in november  we acquired ownership of certain contract operations of aquasource  inc  a provider of contract water and wastewater services in texas and colorado 
the purchase price consisted of approximately  in cash  which was funded primarily by borrowings under our bank lines of credit 
under the terms of our purchase agreement for master tek  the minority owner of master tek has the option to require us to purchase his initial minority interest in increments at a price not to exceed  per year over four years 
the minority owner exercised this option to sell us of master tek stock for which we paid  in cash in april in february  the minority owner exercised his option to sell us an additional of master tek stock for  which we expect to pay in april under the terms of the optech purchase agreement  we have the right to acquire the remaining of optech after five years based on a formula relating to the profitability of optech 
in addition  in august two years after the effective date of the purchase  the minority owner of optech has the option to sell the remaining of optech to us using the same profitability formula  which has a minimum purchase price of financing activities our financing activities include net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  ciac  lue fees  advances and net borrowings on our lines of credit  dividend payments  payments on long term debt and stock transactions among other items 
on august   we obtained a year  secured bank term loan 
the net proceeds of approximately  were used to pay down our bank lines of credit 
the term loan bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus  with principal payments of  due quarterly  beginning in november the note is secured by substantially all of the assets of one of our texas utilities 
we are subject to certain financial covenants under the term loan agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under this agreement 
on july   southwest water issued  of fixed rate convertible subordinate debentures  due july   and received net proceeds of approximately  from the sale after underwriting discounts  commissions and other expenses of the offering 
the net proceeds from the sale of these debentures were used to reduce borrowings on our revolving bank lines of credit 
the debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  and are convertible at any time prior to maturity unless previously redeemed 
we may redeem the debentures in whole or in part at any time  at a redemption price of at july  and declining annually to par of face value after june  the issuance costs of the convertible subordinate debentures in the amount of approximately  are being amortized over years 
we are subject to certain financial covenants under the terms of the indenture agreement for the convertible subordinate debentures 
as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable restrictions 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   the company s contractual obligations were due as follows thereafter in thousands bank lines of credit bank term loan economic development revenue bonds mortgage bonds convertible subordinate debentures notes payable advances for construction purchase of interest in majority owned subsidiary purchase of interest in majority owned subsidiary lease obligations on january   we obtained an unsecured line of credit facility from a commercial bank used to issue a  standby letter of credit as collateral for performance under a service contract for the cvwd to design and construct a reverse osmosis water treatment facility and associated wells 
this standby letter of credit is in force for the estimated two year construction period of the project 
upon acceptance of the completed project by the cvwd  the standby letter of credit facility will be terminated 
under this service contract  we will manage both the design and construction of this facility 
upon acceptance by the cvwd  we will also operate the facility for a year period 
subcontractor agreements with an engineering firm and a large construction firm are being used to fulfill significant obligations of this service contract 
this service contract contains certain guarantees to the cvwd related to our performance  including certain liquidated damages in the event of our failure to perform  other than due to uncontrollable circumstances 
as part of the financing of this project  the cvwd was successful in the sale of insured municipal bonds 
we entered into an agreement with the bond insurer to guarantee our performance under the service contract  subject to certain liability caps in the event of a default 
such liability caps will not exceed an amount equal to  during the two year construction period of the project  and afterwards  during the year operation of the facility  the liability cap will not exceed an amount equal to  plus an amount equal to the replacement of the actual reverse osmosis unit within the facility 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of our significant accounting policies 
recognition of revenues revenues for contract operations are billed based on a monthly fee to provide a specific level of service as outlined in each individual contract 
we usually bill for additional services provided beyond the scope of the base contract on a time and materials basis as such services are rendered 
revenues for construction projects are recorded using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenues for submetering billing and collection services are recognized and billed at the end of the month in which services are performed 
revenues for installation of submetering equipment are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
water utility revenues are recognized when amounts are billed to customers 
an estimated amount for unbilled revenues is also recognized for water used towards the end of the accounting period 

table of contents impairment of goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past that resulted in recording goodwill and intangible assets 
the balance sheets presented in the consolidated financial statements include the goodwill and intangible customer contracts related to the acquisition of the contract services business of aquasource  the goodwill and intangible contract value related to the acquisition of optech  and the goodwill and non compete agreement related to the acquisition of master tek 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually 
for intangible assets with definite useful lives  sfas no 
requires amortization over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values 
sfas no 
became effective for fiscal years beginning after december  at december   other assets include approximately  of net goodwill  which was no longer subject to amortization beginning in there was no impairment of goodwill as of december  prior to implementation of sfas no 
 we recognized approximately  and  of goodwill amortization for the years ended december  and  respectively 
beginning in  we no longer recognized such amortization 
in addition  under the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  we identified approximately  of intangible contract costs in connection with our acquisition of aquasource and approximately  of intangible contract costs in connection with our acquisition of optech 
we are amortizing the intangible contract costs over a period of four years  which is the average estimated life of the contracts 
we do not expect the implementation of sfas nos 
and to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
utility accounting our regulated businesses  which include our utilities in california  new mexico and texas  are required to be accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 which specifies certain revenue  expense and balance sheet treatment as required by each state regulatory agency 
each state agency establishes rates which are intended to permit each utility to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return 
each utility may file and process general rate applications on a periodic basis 
since the established rates may be in effect for several years  our utilities attempt to anticipate cost increases and apply for rates sufficient to permit recovery of those cost increases when incurred 
our texas and new mexico utilities have contracted with one of the companies in our services group to perform operating services  normal maintenance and construction work  and  in addition  manage capital projects 
we believe that these contracts were established utilizing terms and conditions equivalent to prevailing industry rates for similar work performed by our services group for non affiliated entities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our services group recognizes a profit margin from contract work performed and does not eliminate the intercompany profit on the construction contract work performed when the contract sales price is reasonable and it is probable that the costs and capital will be recoverable through the rate making process 
accordingly  the intercompany profit on such projects has not been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
balancing account prior to november   the cpuc permitted california water utilities to record the difference between actual and cpuc adopted water production costs in balancing accounts on the balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment in the income statement 
in  our california utility recorded approximately  of balancing account benefits in its income statement  and had a total balance of approximately  in deferred costs held on its balance sheet at the end of november as mentioned above  no such benefits were available in the disposition of pre november  balancing accounts became the subject of a cpuc rulemaking 
on december   the cpuc issued a decision considered favorable to the water industry that should allow our california utility to recover approximately  that was in its balancing account as of november  collectibility of customer receivables we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our customer receivables  and provide an allowance for uncollectible receivables based upon an estimate by management of the amount of receivables that might not be collectible 
this estimate is predicated upon a number of factors  including historical receivable write off experience  a review of customer accounts with past due uncollected balances  probable costs of collection and the general credit worthiness of our customers 
during  we provided for an additional  of bad debt expense and we wrote off approximately  of uncollectible accounts receivable relating to our services group submetering accounts 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate as of december 
table of contents stock based compensation in  we voluntarily adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that we value stock options issued based upon an option pricing model and recognize this value as an expense over the period in which the options vest 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we have elected to recognize stock based compensation using the retroactive restatement method 
under this change in accounting method  we have restated our consolidated financial statements for all years presented in this annual report on form k and the accompanying consolidated financial statements to reflect stock based compensation expense under a fair value based accounting method for all options granted  modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that do not have vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require us to make subjective assumptions including the expected future volatility of the stock price 
because the stock options we grant have characteristics that are significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the value of an estimate  in management s opinion  the existing option valuation models  including black scholes  do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal use of the assets 
we will also record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation

adoption of new accounting policy stock based compensation we currently sponsor two stock option plans and  prior to  we accounted for those plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of the accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost was reflected in previously reported results  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the preferable fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
under the retroactive restatement transition method as described in sfas no 
 we have recorded compensation costs of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the cost recognized is the same as that which would have been recognized had the fair value method of sfas no 
been applied from its original effective date 
the expense for each of the three years ended december   and was recorded in the caption selling  general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the retroactive restatement transition method of adoption  all periods presented have been restated 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of each option grant 
the black scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected lives and risk free interest rates 
these assumptions reflect management s best estimates  but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used in the current period  stock based compensation could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if management uses different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years 
refer to notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
selected risk factors our capital resources may restrict our ability to operate and expand our business of the  total capacity under our lines of credit  we had approximately  in available borrowing capacity as of december  as a result of using approximately  in borrowings on our lines of credit to fund the acquisition of aqua services in november in addition to this borrowing capacity we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling approximately  as of december  
table of contents as indicated in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in march  we entered into an agreement to amend one of our lines of credit under which the bank increased our line of credit capacity by  through december  we are currently evaluating our capital structure and potential financing alternatives available to us to provide additional liquidity 
these alternatives include increasing the size of our lines of credit  long term asset backed financing capacity in our regulated utilities  sale and leaseback of certain fleet assets and administrative office space  and issuing debt or equity in either a public or private placement offering 
we anticipate that these financing alternatives will enable us to substantially reduce the amounts currently outstanding on our lines of credit during while we believe that there will be lender and investor interest in these financing alternatives  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such funding in also we cannot assure you that any financing completed will not increase our interest expense  dilute the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders  or dilute our earnings per share 
we anticipate that our available line of credit borrowing capacity  cash balances  cash flow generated from operations  and execution of additional financing alternatives will enable us to continue operating and expanding our business 
we may be unable to renew our credit facilities when they expire 
we may be unable to execute additional financing alternatives at terms that we find acceptable 
if we were unable to renew our existing lines of credit  or if we were unable to execute additional financing alternatives  our capital spending would be reduced or delayed  and any future acquisitions would be delayed or eliminated 
while we have the ability to take these actions during  these actions could negatively impact our revenues  revenue growth  and profitability 
our regulated and non regulated operations are subject to seasonality and weather considerations our regulated water utility operations are seasonal 
therefore  the results of operations for one quarter do not indicate results to be expected in another quarter 
rainfall and weather conditions affect our utility operations  with most water consumption occurring during the third quarter of each year when weather tends to be hot and dry 
drought conditions may result in lower revenue due to consumer conservation efforts and a shortage of water supply 
drought conditions may also result in increased water costs to us and adversely affect our profitability 
conversely  unusually wet conditions may result in decreased customer demand  lower revenues and lower profit to our utility operations 
the contract operations business conducted by the subsidiaries in our services group can also be seasonal in nature 
for example  heavy rainfall limits our ability to perform certain billable work such as pipeline maintenance  manhole rehabilitation and other outdoor services 
severe weather conditions can result in additional labor and material costs that may not necessarily be recoverable from the various cities under o m contracts 
environmental matters operations of our utilities in california  new mexico and texas fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the cpuc  the nmprc and the tceq  respectively 
the primary responsibility of these regulatory agencies is to ensure an adequate supply of affordable  healthful  potable water to residents of their respective states 
our operations are also subject to water and wastewater pollution standards and water and wastewater quality regulations of the epa and various state health regulatory agencies 
both the epa and state health regulatory agencies require periodic testing and sampling of water 
costs associated with the testing of water supplies have increased and are expected to increase further as the regulatory agencies adopt additional monitoring requirements 
in november  the epa announced a decision to lower the arsenic standard in drinking water from parts per billion to parts per billion 
although our utilities meet the current parts per billion standard  our utility in new mexico does not meet the newly adopted arsenic standard which must be completely met by our new mexico utility anticipates significant capital expenditures will be required in order to comply with the new standard 
as discussed in item description of business part c 
c 
water quality regulation  we cannot predict the impact that the change in this standard will have on our water utility operations  however  we do not expect it to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or operations 
we believe that future incremental costs of complying with government regulations  including any capital expenditures  will be recoverable through increased rates and contract operations revenues
