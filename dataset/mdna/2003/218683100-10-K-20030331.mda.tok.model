item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain statements under this caption of this annual report on form k constitute forward looking statements which involve certain risks and uncertainties 
core molding s actual results may differ significantly from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to business conditions in the plastics  transportation  recreation and commercial and industrial product industries  the general economy  competitive factors  the dependence on four major customers  the recent efforts of core molding to expand its customer base  new technologies  regulatory requirements  labor relations  the loss or inability to attract key personnel  the availability of capital  the start up of new operations in mexico and management s decisions to pursue new products or businesses which involve additional costs  risks or capital expenditures 
overview core molding has historically been a compounder and compression molder of sheet molding composites smc fiberglass reinforced plastic products 
in october  core molding acquired certain assets of airshield corporation  see note of notes to the financial statements 
as a result of this acquisition  core molding expanded its fiberglass molding capabilities to include the spray up  hand lay up and vacuum assisted resin infusion molding processes 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase accounting method and accordingly the effects of the acquisition are included in the results of operations and financial condition of core molding from the date of the acquisition and forward 
all references to core molding herein refer to the consolidated operations of core molding and its subsidiaries unless noted otherwise 
core molding produces and sells  both smc compound and molded products for varied markets  including the automotive and trucking industries  recreational vehicles and commercial and industrial products 
core molding presently has four major customers  international truck and engine corporation international  yamaha motor manufacturing corporation yamaha  lear corporation lear and freightliner llc freightliner  which account for approximately of the company s sales in and in the demand for core molding s products is affected by the volume of purchases from its customers  whose orders are primarily affected by economic conditions in the united states and canada 
core molding s manufacturing operations have a significant fixed cost component 
accordingly  during periods of changing demands  the profitability of core molding s operations may change proportionately more than revenues from operations 
on december   core molding acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of columbus plastics  a wholly owned operating unit of international s truck manufacturing division since its formation in late at the time of the acquisition of columbus plastics  international and core molding entered into a comprehensive supply agreement  which expired on december  under the terms of the comprehensive supply agreement  core molding became the primary supplier of international s original equipment and service requirements for fiberglass reinforced parts using the smc process 
this comprehensive supply agreement was not renewed during  however  at the end of  core molding and international began negotiations on a new comprehensive supply agreement  which would be retroactive to november  there can be no assurance that such an agreement will ultimately be consummated 
after the expiration of the original comprehensive supply agreement  business with international continued on a purchase order basis  like core molding operates with all of its other customers 
the purchase orders typically provide volume commitments for four weeks at prices previously negotiated 
customers can update their orders on a daily basis for changes in demand that allow them to run their inventories on a just in time basis 
results of operations compared with net sales for totaled  an approximate increase from the  reported for included in total sales are tooling project revenues of  for and  for tooling project revenues are sporadic in nature and do not represent a recurring trend

sales to yamaha in amounted to  which was slightly higher than the  in sales to lear for totaled  an approximate increase from the amount of  the primary reason for the increase was due to the completion of tooling projects for new business that core molding has acquired from lear 
this increase was partially offset by reductions in selling prices on current products being manufactured for lear 
sales to freightliner  which began as a result of the acquisition noted above  totaled  for in  sales to freightliner amounted to  due to the acquisition  as noted above  occurring in october products sold to freightliner include hoods  air deflectors  air fairings  splash panels and other components for the production of its heavy and medium duty trucks 
sales to other customers increased approximately to  from  in this increase was primarily the result of new business with paccar 
sales to paccar amounted to  sales to paccar were generated primarily from the completion of tooling projects for new business that the company has acquired

partially offsetting the gain was the company discontinuing its business relationship with case new holland 
sales to case new holland were  for the year ending december  gross margin was of sales in compared to of sales in the increase in gross margin was primarily due to a combination of many factors including improvements in material costs  labor efficiency  reduced energy costs and repairs and maintenance costs at the company s columbus  ohio facility 
this increase in gross margin was partially offset by reduced margins at the company s gaffney  south carolina facility primarily due to selling price reductions to lear corporation  as noted above  and operating inefficiencies that were experienced throughout the year 
gross margins from the newly established operations resulting from the acquisition noted above were generally in line with core molding s historical business 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  in  which was greater than the  incurred in the increase from was primarily due to the additional costs added as a result of the acquisition of the mexican operation

compared with net sales for totaled  down approximately from the  reported for included in total sales are tooling project revenues of  for and  for tooling project revenues are sporadic in nature and do not represent a recurring trend 
sales to international totaled  an approximate decrease from the amount of  the primary reason for the decrease was lower demand from international resulting from an industry wide general decline in truck orders due to the soft general economy during sales to yamaha of components for personal watercraft decreased in by to  compared with  in the decrease in sales to yamaha is primarily due to the negative impact general economic conditions have had on the demand for personal watercraft 
sales to lear for totaled  the lear product consists of components that lear assembles into seat bottoms and backs for a sports utility pick up truck recently introduced by an automotive original equipment manufacturer 
core molding began selling these products in the first quarter of sales to freightliner  as a result of the acquisition noted above  for totaled  products sold to freightliner include hoods  air deflectors  air fairings  splash panels and other components for the production of its heavy and medium duty trucks 
sales to other customers decreased approximately to  from  in this decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales to case new holland of  as a result of case new holland moving production of their products to another supplier in may also adding to the decrease was the discontinuance of the company s business relationship with caradon doors and windows  peachtree division  in july sales to peachtree totaled  in offsetting a portion of the decrease were sales brought on from the acquisition noted above to other various customers of  from the acquisition date through the end of the year 
gross margin was of sales in compared to of sales in the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to fixed costs associated with excess capacity  production inefficiencies associated with reduced order flow  and new product start ups  mostly affecting the columbus plant 
however  improved productivity and a better product mix resulted in gross margin improvement in the gaffney plant compared to last year 
the company also experienced increasing employee benefit costs  mainly due to an increase in employee health insurance costs 
gross margins from the newly established operations resulting from the acquisition noted above were in line with the company s other operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  in  which was less than the  incurred in the year saw a reduction of the salary workforce in the columbus and gaffney facilities resulting in a  cost savings  however  increasing benefit costs  mainly due to employee health care costs  partially offset this 
the company also implemented a cost containment plan that resulted in total cost reductions of  in the areas of supplies  outside and professional services  travel and other miscellaneous expenses 
interest expense totaled  for increasing slightly from  in the increase in interest expense from was primarily the result of a decrease in interest capitalized on capital projects due to lower capital expenditures 
tax expense for was approximately of total loss before taxes

per basic and diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources core molding s primary cash requirements are for operating expenses and capital expenditures 
these cash requirements have historically been met through a combination of cash flow from operations  equipment leasing  issuance of industrial revenue bonds and bank lines of credit 
cash provided by operations in totaled  net income provided  of operating cash flows 
non cash deductions of depreciation and amortization added  of positive cash flow 
an increase in accounts payable contributed  to operating cash flows due to timing differences 
a decrease in deferred income taxes also had a positive effect on cash flow of  which is a result of core molding s net operating loss carryforwards reducing current year tax obligations 
in addition  the increase in the postretirement benefits liability of  also provided positive cash flow 
core molding expects this item to provide positive cash flow until such time that retirees begin to utilize their retirement medical benefits 
partially offsetting the above mentioned increases in operating cash flow was a decrease in other accrued liabilities of  due to the settlement of various liabilities that were assumed as part of the airshield acquisition 
also decreasing operating cash flow was an increase of inventory of  this was primarily due to inventory levels at core molding s gaffney  south carolina facility adjusting for new business that began late in an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased operating cash flow by  primarily due to recoverable taxes related to the mexican operation 
investing activities increased cash flows by  in proceeds from maturities on the company s mortgage backed security investment were  in core molding has an outstanding balance of  in this investment 
capital expenditures totaled  which was primarily related to the acquisition of machinery and equipment 
at december   commitments for capital expenditures in progress were  capital expenditures for are expected to be  financing activities reduced cash flows by  for the principal repayment on the industrial revenue bond  which was issued in principal payments on the industrial revenue bond increase each year through the maturity date  which is april at december   core molding had cash on hand of  and an available line of credit of  which is scheduled to mature on april  as of december   core molding was in compliance of all three of its financial debt covenants for the line of credit and letter of credit securing the industrial revenue bond and certain equipment leases 
the covenants relate to maintaining certain financial ratios 
management expects the company to meet these covenants for the year however  if a material adverse change in the financial position of the company should occur  the company s liquidity and ability to obtain further financing to fund future operating and capital requirements could be negatively impacted 
because the company was in compliance of all three of its debt covenants  had a cash balance in excess of  and had no outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit  a principal payment in the amount of  which is classified as a current portion of long term debt on the company s balance sheet  has been be made to international on march  critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  post retirement benefits  and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  at december  and  at december  management also records estimates for customer returns  discounts offered to customers  and for price adjustments 
should customer returns  discounts  and price adjustments fluctuate from the estimated amounts  additional allowances may be required 
the company had recorded an allowance for chargebacks of  at december  and  at december  inventories management identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related to these inventories 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant 
should actual results differ from these estimates  additional provisions may be required 
the company had recorded an allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory of  at december  and  at december  goodwill and long lived assets management evaluates whether impairment exists for goodwill and long lived assets 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine impairment  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  decreases in future cash flows from operations below the assumptions could have an adverse affect on the company s operations 
the company has not recorded any impairment to goodwill or long lived assets for the years ended december  and post retirement benefits management records an accrual for post retirement costs associated with the company sponsored health care plan 
should actual results differ from the assumptions used to determine the reserves  additional provisions may be required 
in particular  increases in future healthcare costs above the assumptions could have an adverse affect on the company s operations 
the company had recorded a liability for post retirement medical benefits based on actuarially computed estimates of  at december  and  at december  income taxes management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance and recorded a valuation allowance 
the valuation reserve will be adjusted as the company determines the actual amount of deferred tax assets that will be realized 
the company had recorded a valuation allowance of  at december  and december  income taxes the balance sheet at december  and includes a deferred tax asset of  and  net of a valuation allowance of  in and the deferred tax asset is net of a valuation allowance since it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized in the future 
the deferred tax asset at december   primarily includes the tax benefits associated with cumulative net operating losses of approximately  temporary differences between the book and tax basis of core molding s property and equipment of approximately  and temporary differences relating to post retirement and pension benefits of  the valuation allowance at december   assumes that it is more likely than not that approximately  of the cumulative net operating losses will not be realized before their expiration date 
taxable income loss for and was approximately  and  respectively 
extensive analysis is performed to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset 
such analysis is based upon the premise that core molding is and will continue as a going concern and that it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of core molding using a number of alternatives to evaluate financial results in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
other factors considered are the company s long standing relationship with its two largest customers international and yamaha and core molding s recent customer diversification efforts 
the projected availability of taxable income to realize the tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of temporary differences before expiration of these benefits are also considered 
management believes that  with the combination of available tax planning strategies and the maintenance of its relationships with its key customers  earnings are achievable in order to realize the net deferred tax asset of  inflation inflation generally affects core molding by increasing the cost of labor  equipment and raw materials 
management believes that  because rates of inflation have been moderate during the periods presented  inflation has not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements on june   the fasb issued sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement applies to intangibles and goodwill acquired after june   as well as goodwill and intangibles previously acquired

this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company is currently analyzing the impact of this statement and does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk core molding s primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
core molding is also exposed to changes in the price of commodities used in its manufacturing operations 
the company does not hold any material market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
core molding has the following four items that are sensitive to a change in interest rates long term debt consisting of an industrial revenue bond irb with a balance at december   of  interest is variable and is computed weekly 
the average interest rate charged for was and the maximum interest rate that may be charged at any time over the life of the irb is 
in order to minimize the effect of the interest rate fluctuation  core molding has entered an interest swap arrangement under which core molding pays a fixed rate of to a bank and receives of the day commercial paper rate  long term secured note payable with a balance as of december  of  at a fixed interest rate of  revolving line of credit  which bears interest at libor plus three and one quarter percent or the prime rate  and foreign currency purchases in which core molding purchases mexican pesos with united states dollars to meet certain obligations that arise due to the facility located in mexico 
assuming a hypothetical change in short term interest rates in both and  interest expense would not change significantly  as the interest rate swap agreement would generally offset the impact
