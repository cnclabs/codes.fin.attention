table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
sales recognition the majority of our sales are product sales 
sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of our sales are product sales recognized upon shipment 
usual sales terms are fob shipping point  at which time title and risk of loss has passed to the customer 
from time to time  we enter into contracts to sell our products and services  and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there may be agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting  including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple deliverables  whether undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of delivered elements  and when to recognize revenue 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the following criteria are satisfied undelivered elements are not essential to the functionality of delivered elements  uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved  no significant obligations remain  and the fair value of each undelivered element is known 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might affect the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
we also sell certain third party service contracts and software assurance for which we are not the primary obligor 
these sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales recognition and thus are recorded on a net sales recognition basis 
as we enter into contracts with third party service providers or vendors  we must evaluate whether the subsequent sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales 
under gross sales recognition  the entire selling price is recorded in sales and our cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded in costs of goods sold 
under net sales recognition  the cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to sales resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction and there is no costs of goods sold 
we make provisions for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy  based upon historical return rates 
should customers return a different amount of product than originally estimated  our future net sales are adjusted to reflect historical return rates 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
the determination of fair values requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to acquired intangible assets 
we engaged an independent third party appraisal firm to assist us in determining the fair values of intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of comark 
the fair values assigned to the identified intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of comark are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in item critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the 
table of contents brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in addition  liabilities to integrate or restructure acquired organizations  including the termination of employees  are subject to change as we continue our assessment of operations and execute the approved plan 
valuation of long lived assets including purchased intangible assets and goodwill we review property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
this approach uses our estimates of future market growth  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates 
we assess whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis 
upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment  we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill has been impaired 
such evaluations of impairment of long lived assets including goodwill and purchased intangible assets are an integral part of  but not limited to  our strategic reviews of our business and operations performed in conjunction with restructuring actions 
when an impairment is identified  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value 
deterioration of our business in a geographic region or within a business segment in the future could also lead to impairment adjustments as such issues are identified 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on customer and vendor receivables based on historical write offs  evaluation of the aging of the receivables and the current economic environment 
should actual collections of customer and vendor receivables differ from our estimates  adjustments to the provision for losses on accounts receivable and the related allowances for doubtful accounts would be necessary 
provisions for inventories we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account our contractual provisions with our suppliers governing price protection  stock rotation and return privileges relating to obsolescence 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions by manufacturers to discontinue certain product lines can affect the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
taxes on earnings our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no united states taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states 
earnings remittance amounts are planned based on the projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements could affect our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed

net sales for the year ended december  increased to billion from billion for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to the addition of the net sales from comark  which was acquired on april   and to a lesser extent the acquisitions of action plc action and kortex computer centre ltd 
kortex  which were acquired in october additionally  net sales of microsoft software products were strong in the second and third quarter of due to the july deadline for microsoft s upgrade programs

table of contents compared to net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to billion from billion for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to net sales from comark  which was acquired on april  and to a lesser extent  the acquisition of kortex in october additionally  net sales of microsoft software products were strong in the second and third quarter of due to the july deadline for microsoft s upgrade programs 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in net sales in our base north american operations due to a decline in overall information technology spending  an increase in the proportion of certain software products and third party services that are recorded under net sales recognition and an increased focus on maximizing gross margin by minimizing the volume of unprofitable sales

factors that may affect future results and financial condition integration and operation of past and future acquired businesses 
over the past eighteen months  we completed the acquisitions of comark in the united states  action in the united kingdom and kortex in canada 
these acquired operations now comprise a material portion of our business 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the conversion of information systems and assimilation of operations of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience  assumption of unknown liabilities and the potential loss of key employees and or customers of the acquired company  all of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in particular  there are risks associated with the integration of comark in while we have achieved our goals for the integration to date  the final integration includes the conversion of our united states direct marketing operation to one it system platform and combined business processes 
our strategy includes the possible acquisition of other businesses to expand or complement our operations 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
there is no assurance that we will identify acquisition candidates that would result in successful combinations or that any such acquisitions will be consummated on acceptable terms 
any future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the utilization of cash  amortization of expenses related to identifiable intangible assets and future impairments of acquired goodwill  all of which could adversely affect our profitability 
reduced demand for products and services in our industry 
the computer industry in general has felt the effects of the slowdown in the united states and european economies and we specifically have seen a decrease in demand for the products and services we sell 
sales can be dependent on specific product categories  and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our sales if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes 
our operating results are also highly dependent upon our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales which fluctuates due to numerous factors  including changes in prices from suppliers  reductions in the amount of supplier reimbursements that are made available  changes in customer mix  the relative mix of products sold during the period  general competitive conditions  the availability of opportunistic purchases and opportunities to increase market share 
in addition  our expense levels  including the costs and salaries incurred in connection with the hiring of account executives  are based  in part  on anticipated sales 
therefore  we may not be able to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall 
as a result  comparisons of our quarterly financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

table of contents current unfavorable economic conditions including uncertainty created by military action 
our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  the condition of the computer and related products industry  shifts in demand for or availability of computer and related products and industry introductions of new products  upgrades or methods of distribution 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot be presently predicted 
actions of competitors 
the it products and services industry is intensely competitive 
competition is based primarily on price  product availability  speed of delivery  credit availability  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs and quality and breadth of product lines 
we compete with manufacturers including manufacturers whose products we sell such as hewlett packard and ibm as well as a large number and wide variety of marketers and resellers of it products and services 
these marketers and resellers include national direct marketers such as computer discount warehouse and national and regional resellers including value added resellers and specialty retailers  aggregators  distributors  national computer retailers  national computer retailers  computer superstores  internet only computer providers  consumer electronics and office supply superstores and mass merchandisers 
product manufacturers  in particular  have been increasing their efforts to sell directly to the business customer  particularly larger corporate customers  and thus have become more of a competitive threat to us than in the past 
certain of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than us 
in addition  some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition and engage in more extensive promotional activities  offer more attractive terms to customers and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we do 
additionally  several of our competitors have lower operating cost structures  allowing them to profitably employ more aggressive pricing strategies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  product resellers and direct marketers are combining operations or acquiring or merging with other resellers and direct marketers to increase efficiency 
moreover  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 
generally  pricing is very aggressive in the industry and we expect pricing pressures to continue 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  higher sales  cost reductions or otherwise 
price reductions by our competitors that we either can not or choose not to match  could result in an erosion of our market share and or reduced sales or  to the extent we match such reductions  could result in reduced operating margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in supplier reimbursement and buying programs 
certain suppliers provide us with substantial incentives in the form of payment discounts  supplier reimbursements  price protections and rebates 
supplier funds are used to offset  among other things  cost of goods sold  marketing costs and other operating expenses 
no assurance can be given that we will continue to receive such incentives or that we will be able to collect outstanding amounts relating to these incentives in a timely manner  or at all 
a reduction in  the discontinuance of  a significant delay in receiving or the inability to collect such incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  compaq computer corporation and hewlett packard company merged on may  effective november   the merged entity  hewlett packard  instituted changes to its supplier funding programs and its operating agreements 
these changes will cause us to be more dependent on hewlett packard s successful execution of its business plan as we will start acquiring more product directly from hewlett packard as opposed to distributors 
the program changes are still relatively new and we cannot assure you that these changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there is no assurance that other manufacturers will not also institute similar or more restrictive changes 
management of growth 
since our inception  we have experienced substantial changes in and expansion of our business and operations through both acquisitions such as comark and action  which collectively are now a material portion of our business  and internal growth 
the comark and action acquisitions have placed  and any future acquisitions may place  significant demands on our operational  financial  administrative and other resources 
for example  we will need to integrate our information systems with those of comark in order to realize the efficiencies we expected when we acquired comark 
our operating expenses and staffing levels have increased and are expected to increase in the future as our business grows 
in particular  we have retained a significant percentage of the comark and action employees and there can be no assurance that such persons will perform to our expectations 
competition for highly qualified personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract  assimilate and retain qualified persons in the future 
in addition  we expect that any future expansion will continue to challenge our ability to hire  train  motivate and manage our employees 
we also expect over time to expend considerable resources to expand convert our information system and to implement a 
table of contents variety of new systems and procedures 
system conversion decisions may result in write downs of existing hardware and software that will not be used after the integration or conversion 
if our sales do not increase in proportion to our operating expenses  our information systems do not expand to meet increasing demands  or we fail to attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel or otherwise fail to manage our expansion effectively  there would be a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve our growth strategy 
changing methods of distribution 
the manner in which it products and services are distributed and sold is changing 
hardware and software manufacturers have sold  and have publicly stated their intent to intensify their efforts to sell  their products directly to end users 
certain manufacturers have instituted programs for the direct sales of large order quantities of hardware and software to certain major corporate accounts 
these types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various manufacturers 
in addition  manufacturers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically to end users 
an increase in the volume of products sold through any of these competitive programs or distributed electronically to end users could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with international operations 
we initiated an operation in canada in and completed acquisitions in europe in as part of our effort to penetrate international markets 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed additional acquisitions in canada and the united kingdom 
also in the fourth quarter of  we closed down our german operation  which was acquired in  in order to focus resources exclusively on the united kingdom 
in implementing our international strategy  we face barriers to entry and competition from local companies and other companies that already have established global businesses  as well as the risks generally associated with conducting business internationally 
these risks include local labor conditions and regulations  exposure to currency fluctuations  limitations on foreign investment and the additional expense and risks inherent in operating in geographically and culturally diverse locations 
while we believe we will effectively integrate our international acquisitions with our own operations  we may be unable to integrate smoothly the acquired companies sales  administration  distribution and information systems  resulting in our inability to realize anticipated cost savings and or sales growth 
for a discussion of risks associated with past and future acquisitions  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition factors that may affect future results and financial condition risks associated with past and future acquisitions  in item because we may continue to develop our international business through acquisitions  we may also be subject to risks associated with such acquisitions  including those relating to the marriage of different corporate cultures and shared decision making 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed in increasing our international business  or do so  in a profitable manner 
reliance on suppliers 
we acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly through distributors 
purchases from tech data corporation and ingram micro  inc  which are distributors  and hewlett packard company  a manufacturer  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of aggregate purchases in no other supplier accounted for more than of purchases in however  the top five suppliers as a group ingram micro  inc  tech data corporation  hewlett packard company  synnex information technologies  inc a distributor and ibm a manufacturer accounted for approximately of our total product purchases during the loss of tech data corporation  ingram micro  inc or any other supplier could cause a short term disruption in the availability of products 
the reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our suppliers could increase our cost of working capital and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  there is no assurance that as manufacturers continue to sell directly to end users  they will not limit or curtail the availability of their product to resellers 
certain of the products offered from time to time by us are subject to manufacturer allocation  which limits the number of units of such products available to us 
our inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of product or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way that favors one of our competitors relative to us could cause us to be unable to fill customers orders in a timely manner  or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
reliance on information and telephone systems 
we believe that our success to date has been  and future results of operations will be  dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to customers 
our ability to provide such services is largely dependent on the accuracy  quality and utilization of the information generated by our information systems  which affect our ability to manage our sales  distribution  inventory and accounting systems 
additionally  our success is dependent on our ability to successfully integrate our information system with those of acquired entities 
we currently plan to convert to one software platform in our united states direct marketing operations by the end of once this conversion is completed  we intend to convert our canadian and united kingdom operations to this software platform 
there can be no assurances that these conversions will not cause material disruptions in our business  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
although we have built redundancy into most of our systems  and have comprehensive data backup  we do not have a formal disaster recovery capability  therefore  a substantial interruption in our information systems or in our telephone communication systems would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents reliance on our outsourcing clients 
through our operating segment  direct alliance  we perform business process outsourcing services for a small number of manufacturers in the computer and consumer electronics industry pursuant to various arrangements 
for the years ended december  and   one outsourcing client accounted for approximately and  respectively  of direct alliance s net sales 
although the contracts with this client are generally multi year contracts  this client may cancel its contracts under certain circumstances on relatively short notice or elect to not renew them upon expiration 
there is no assurance that we will be able to replace any outsourcing clients that terminate or fail to renew their relationships with us 
additionally  we seek to expand our offerings both within and outside of the computer industry 
the failure to maintain current arrangements or the inability to enter into new ones within or outside the computer industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
substantially all of our current outsourcing clients are manufacturers in the computer industry  and  therefore  are subject to the same risks as we are with respect to our insight north america and insight uk operations 
these risks may negatively impact the amount of business our clients outsource to us 
rapid changes in product standards may result in substantial inventory obsolescence 
the computer and related products industry is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements  which can decrease demand for current products or render them obsolete 
in addition  in order to satisfy customer demand  protect ourselves against product shortages  obtain greater purchasing discounts and react to changes in original equipment manufacturers terms and conditions  we may carry relatively high inventory levels of certain products that may have limited or no return privileges 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid losses related to inventory obsolescence on these products 
dependence on key personnel 
our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management  sales and technical personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options  or attract additional highly qualified personnel 
further  we make a significant investment in the training of our sales account executives 
our inability to retain such personnel or to train them rapidly enough to meet our expanding needs could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales staff  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the majority of our existing financing arrangements expire in and if we are unable to renew these arrangements or replace them on acceptable terms we may incur higher interest expenses or your equity interest may be diluted 
on december   we entered into new financing arrangements with two financial institutions  replacing our previous credit facilities 
our new facilities include a million accounts receivable securitization program  a million revolving line of credit and a million inventory financing facility 
the availability under each of these facilities is subject to formulas based on our eligible accounts receivable or inventories 
as of december   the aggregate outstanding balance under these facilities was million and we had million available 
the accounts receivable securitization program expires december  and the line of credit and inventory facility each expire on december  the accounts receivable securitization program is renewable and we currently intend to renew the program on december  however  we may be unable to renew our existing accounts receivable securitization program or secure alternative financing or  if we are able to renew our existing accounts receivable securitization program or secure alternative financing  it may be on less favorable terms such as higher interest rates 
if we were unable to renew our existing accounts receivable securitization program or secure alternative financing  we may be required to seek other financing alternatives such as selling additional equity securities or convertible debt securities that would dilute the equity interests of current shareholders 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all 
changes in state sales or use tax collection requirements may increase our administrative burden and our prices to customers 
we presently collect sales or use taxes in virtually all states which impose such taxes  however  the requirement to collect varies by each subsidiary s activities 
for subsidiaries targeting small to medium sized business businesses with less than  computers  we collect sales or use tax in arizona  california  illinois  indiana and tennessee 
in our subsidiaries targeting larger corporate enterprises businesses with at least  computers and governmental entities  we collect sales or use tax in most states 
various states have sought to impose on direct marketers the burden of collecting state sales or use taxes on the sales of products shipped to that state s residents 
on november   representatives of over thirty states voted to approve the streamlined sales and use tax agreement the agreement  an agreement between states to simplify sales and use tax compliance for all sellers and to encourage and incent voluntary collection by remote sellers 
the agreement is only effective after at least ten states  comprising at least twenty percent of the total population of states with a sales tax  become members of the agreement 
the united states supreme court has affirmed its position that  under the commerce clause of the united states constitution  a state cannot constitutionally impose sales or use tax collection obligations on an out of state mail order company whose only contacts with the state are the distribution of catalogs and other advertising materials through the mail and the subsequent delivery of purchased goods by united states mail or by interstate common carrier from a point outside of the state 
while the agreement cannot force direct marketers to collect tax  
table of contents states hope it may aid their efforts to win congressional approval of the power to require remote sellers to collect tax 
if the supreme court changes its position or if legislation is passed to overturn the supreme court s decision  the imposition of a sales or use tax collection obligation on the subsidiaries which do not currently collect sales or use tax may result in additional administrative expenses  price increases to the customer  or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business 
we also collect goods and services taxes in all provinces in canada and value added tax in the united kingdom 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations will increase our costs and divert management s attention 
the sarbanes oxley act of the act that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
the act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects 
in addition to final rules and rules already made  nasdaq has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies  such as us  that are listed on the nasdaq 
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards 
this investment will increase our legal and financial costs and divert management time and attention from other activities 
we expect these changes to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain executive officers and qualified members for our board of directors  particularly to serve on the audit committee 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of costs we will incur as a result of the act 
the results of litigation may affect our operating results 
from time to time we will be made defendants to lawsuits both in the ordinary course of business and as a result of other circumstances 
depending on the claims made and the nature of the relief sought  any such lawsuit  if decided against us  could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are a defendant in a lawsuit pending in the united states district court  district of arizona which alleges violations of section b of the securities exchange act of  and sec rule b three separate lawsuits filed by stockholders have been consolidated into a single action 
the plaintiff in this action alleges we and certain of our officers made false and misleading statements pertaining to our business  operations and management in an effort to inflate the price of our common stock 
the lawsuit also names as co defendants eric j 
crown  the chairman of our board of directors  timothy a 
crown  our chief executive officer and a director  and stanley laybourne  a director and our executive vice president  chief financial officer and treasurer 
in the consolidated complaint  which was filed in december  the plaintiff seeks class action status to represent all buyers of our common stock from september  through july  we intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously  and in february filed a motion to dismiss 
the costs associated with defending the allegations in these lawsuits and the potential outcome cannot be determined at this time and  accordingly  no estimate for such costs  other than the deductible amount under our directors and officers liability insurance policies have been included in these consolidated financial statements 
we cannot assure you that these  or any other piece of litigation that we are currently party to  or that may be filed against us in the future  will not have an adverse affect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we issue options under our stock option plans and sell shares under our employee stock purchase plan  which dilute the interest of stockholders 
we have reserved shares of our common stock for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan  our long term incentive plan the ltip and our broad based incentive plan 
as approved by our stockholders  our ltip provides that additional shares may be reserved for issuance based on a formula contained in that plan 
the formula provides that the total number of shares of common stock remaining for grant under the ltip and any of our other option plans  plus the number of shares subject to unexercised options granted under any stock plan shall not exceed of the outstanding shares of our common stock at the time of calculation of the additional shares 
therefore  we will reserve additional shares on an ongoing basis for issuance under this plan 
at december   we had options outstanding to acquire  shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of 
based on the ltip formula  we had  shares of common stock available for grant of stock options at december  additionally  we have reserved shares of common stock of our subsidiaries  direct alliance corporation and plusnet technologies limited under the direct alliance long term incentive plan and the plusnet technologies limited long term incentive plan 
the amount of shares reserved for issuance under these plans represents of the outstanding stock of the respective subsidiaries 
at december  we had options outstanding to acquire  shares of common stock of direct alliance corporation at a weighted average exercise price of and options to acquire  shares of common stock of plusnet technologies limited at a weighted average exercise price of 
when stock options with an exercise price lower than the current market price are exercised  our stockholders will experience dilution in the price of their shares and may experience a dilution of earnings per share due to the increased number of shares outstanding 
also  the terms upon which we will be able to obtain equity capital may be affected  because the holders of outstanding options can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain needed capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided in outstanding options 

table of contents our stock price has experienced volatility 
our common stock has experienced in the past  and could experience in the future  substantial price volatility as a result of a number of factors  including quarter increases or decreases in net sales  gross margin or earnings  and changes in our business  operations or prospects or any of our segments  announcements by us  our competitors or our vendors  changes in net sales or earnings estimates by the investment community  speculation in the investment community about our strategic position and ability to successfully integrate the former comark operations into our north american operations  or speculation about our ability to successfully convert our united states direct marketing operations  which includes the former comark operations  onto one it system platform 
the stock market has also experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have affected the market price of many companies and which at times have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is traded 
broad market fluctuations  developments in the it industry  general economic conditions and political and current events may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  if our current security holders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued upon acquisitions or exercise of outstanding options  in the public market  the market price of our common stock could decline 
following periods of volatility in a company s stock price  securities class action litigation against a company is sometimes instituted as was against us in for a discussion of risks associated with our current litigation  see risk factor the results of litigation may affect our operating results  elsewhere in this section 
some anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholders rights agreement  as well as provisions of delaware law  could impair a takeover attempt 
we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
these include provisions authorizing blank check preferred stock  which could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to its common stock  limiting the liability of  and providing indemnification to  directors and officers  limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings  requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors  controlling the procedures for conduct of board and stockholder meetings and election and removal of directors  and specifying that stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders 
these provisions  alone or together  could deter or delay hostile takeovers  proxy contests and changes in control or management 
as a delaware corporation  we are also subject to provisions of delaware law  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 
on december   each stockholder of record received one preferred share purchase right right on each outstanding share of common stock owned 
each right entitles stockholders to buy 
of a share of our series a preferred stock at an exercise price of 
the rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock or announces a tender offer for or more of the common stock 
should this occur  the right will entitle its holder to purchase  at the right s exercise price  a number of shares of common stock having a market value at the time of twice the right s exercise price 
rights held by the holder will become void and will not be exercisable to purchase shares at the bargain purchase price 
if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person acquires or more of the our common stock  each right will entitle its holder to purchase at the right s then current exercise price a number of the acquiring company s common shares having a market value at the time of twice the right s exercise price 
any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares our common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 
sales of additional common stock and securities convertible into our common stock may dilute the voting power of current holders 
we may issue equity securities in the future whose terms and rights are superior to those of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
these are 
table of contents blank check preferred shares  meaning our board of directors is authorized to designate and issue the shares from time to time without stockholder consent 
no preferred shares are currently outstanding 
any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future could be given voting and conversion rights that could dilute the voting power and equity of existing holders of shares of common stock  and have preferences over shares of common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights 
we have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not currently plan to do so in the foreseeable future 
our equity securities are entitled to receive any dividends that may be declared by our board of directors 
we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and our credit facility prohibits the payment of cash dividends without lender approval 
we intend to retain any future earnings to provide funds for operations of our business and currently do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have interest rate exposure arising from our financing arrangements  which have variable interest rates 
this variable interest rate is affected by changes in short term interest rates 
we manage interest rate exposure through our conservative debt ratio target and our mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   the fair value of our long term debt approximated its carrying value 
we also have foreign currency translation exposure arising from the purchase and operation of foreign entities 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure and may from time to time enter into hedging transactions to manage this exposure 
there were no significant hedging transactions during or hedging instruments outstanding at december
