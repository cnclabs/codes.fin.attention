see business business expansion and management s discussion and analysis certain factors affecting future operating results 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
principals of consolidation and minority interests the company s restaurant operations are conducted through multiple wholly owned subsidiaries as well as through four majority owned limited liability companies and through a owned joint venture 
the company s consolidated financial statements include balance sheet and income statement items  after eliminating intercompany accounts and transactions  of each wholly owned and majority owned subsidiary 
the proportionate interest of the earnings or loss of majority owned subsidiaries attributable to the minority owners of those subsidiaries is reflected in a single statement of operations entry  with minority interests in earnings being a reduction in net income and minority interests in losses being an increase in net income 
the proportionate interest in the equity of majority owned subsidiaries attributable to the minority owners of those subsidiaries is reflected as a single balance sheet entry between liabilities and stockholders equity 
the company s interest in the owned joint venture which operates the universal citywalk daily grill is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  the balance sheet and statement of operations items of that joint venture are not included on the company s financial statements 
instead  the company reports on its statement of operations a single line entry reflecting its proportionate interest in the earnings or loss of the joint venture  provided that the aggregate net losses from the joint venture do not exceed the company s equity in the venture 
the company s equity in the joint venture is reflected as an investment on the balance sheet which is adjusted  but not below zero  to reflect the company s aggregate share of net income and losses of the venture 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews all long lived assets on a regular basis to determine if there has been an impairment in the value of those assets 
if  upon review  it is determined that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable  the company will record a charge to earnings and reduce the value of the asset on the balance sheet to the amount determined to be recoverable 
for purposes of evaluating recoverability of long lived assets  the recoverability test is performed using undiscounted cash flows of the individual restaurants and consolidated undiscounted net cash flows for long lived assets not identifiable to individual restaurants compared to the related carrying value 
if the undiscounted operating income is less than the carrying value  the amount of the impairment  if any  will be determined by comparing the carrying value of each asset with its fair value 
fair value is generally based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
utilizing the above method  the company  in prior years  wrote down the assets of its pizza restaurants to zero 
based on the company s review of its presently operating restaurants and other long lived assets  during the fiscal year ended december   the company recorded no impairments of its long lived assets
