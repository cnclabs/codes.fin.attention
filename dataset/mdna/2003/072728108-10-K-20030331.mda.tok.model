fpl energy seabrook agreed to purchase of the  mw unit and of the partially constructed unit  for million subject to certain adjustments  with payment deliverable fully in cash at closing 
on november   the company closed the sale of its interests in seabrook and received cash consideration of approximately million for its interests in the seabrook project 
see item  recent developments sale of seabrook 
baycorp derived all of its operating revenue through its energy trading activities and its equity interest in great bay and little bay 
great bay and little bay were dissolved on december  in october  baycorp created two new subsidiaries  great bay power marketing  inc gbpm and baycorp ventures  llc 
gbpm was created to hold the purchased power contract that great bay had with unitil and arrange for the power supply to satisfy the contract 
see item  pre november and current business purchased power agreements 
baycorp created baycorp ventures  llc to serve as a vehicle through which the company can make investments following the seabrook sale and the expiration of the company s tender offer

as of december   the company owned of houstonstreet 
houstonstreet raised additional equity in from outside investors and as a result  as of december   the company s ownership fell below  to 
subsequently  the company deconsolidated houstonstreet as of december   started accounting for this investment on the equity method and suspended recognition of additional houstonstreet losses as of that date 
as of december   the company owned approximately of houstonstreet 
baycorp reported net income for the years ended december  and and reported net losses for the years ended december   and the net income in was primarily attributable to the gain on sale of the seabrook assets to fpl energy seabrook 
the net income in was primarily attributable to increased revenues and the realized gain in on firm forward energy trading contracts 
the net loss was primarily attributable to the non cash charge to earnings for unrealized losses on firm forward trading contracts and the costs associated with a seabrook refueling outage during the final ten weeks of as well as the loss associated with the company s equity investment in houstonstreet 
the net loss was primarily due to costs associated with the refueling outage during the fall of and to houstonstreet losses 
the net loss was primarily due to the costs associated with the unscheduled outages at the seabrook project that occurred during the year and to the charge related to the termination of a power marketing agreement between great bay and peco energy company 
the seabrook project from time to time experienced both scheduled and unscheduled outages 
baycorp incurred losses during outage periods due to the loss of all revenues from the sale of generation and additional costs associated with the outages as well as continuing operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation 
unscheduled outages or operation of the unit at reduced capacity could occur due to the automatic operation of safety systems following the detection of a malfunction 
in addition  it was possible for the unit to be shut down or operated at reduced capacity based on the results of scheduled and unscheduled inspections and routine surveillance by seabrook project personnel 
refueling outages were generally scheduled every months depending upon the seabrook project capacity factor and the rate at which the nuclear fuel was consumed 
a scheduled refueling outage began on may  seabrook resumed full operating capacity on june  the following discussion focuses solely on operating revenues and operating expenses that are presented in a substantially consistent manner for all of the periods presented 
results of operations operating revenues baycorp s operating revenues for decreased by approximately  or  to  as compared to  for the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in purchased power  a decrease in selling prices and ownership of the seabrook plant for only ten months of the year 
the company purchased a significant amount of power to cover firm contracts primarily due to unscheduled outages in  and also purchased power for resale in  thus increasing revenues 
purchased power expenses for the twelve months ended december  were approximately  as compared to approximately  for the twelve months ended december  power was purchased primarily in the fourth quarter of to cover firm power supply commitments following the sale of seabrook 
the capacity factor at the seabrook project was of the rated capacity for the twelve months ended december  as compared to a capacity factor of for the twelve months ended december  sales of electricity were  kwhs in as compare to  kwhs in the company realized a lower average selling price in during the twelve months ended december   the average selling price decreased to cents per kwh as compared to an average selling price of cents per kwh for the twelve months ended december  great bay s cost of power determined by dividing total operating expenses by kwhs sold during the applicable period increased to cents per kwh in as compared to cents per kwh in the increase was the result of decreased kwhs sold in baycorp s operating revenues for increased by approximately  or  to  as compared to  for the increase was attributable to several factors 
the capacity factor at the seabrook project was of the rated capacity for the twelve months ended december  as compared to a capacity factor of for the twelve months ended december  operating revenues and capacity factor were adversely impacted in and by the scheduled refueling outage at the seabrook project that began on october  a return to full power was expected on november  the outage was extended when damage to one of the plant s emergency diesel generators occurred  requiring an extensive repair effort 
the seabrook project returned to full power on february  the company purchased a significant amount of power to cover firm contracts  primarily due to this refueling outage  and also purchased power for resale in  thus increasing revenues 
purchased power expenses for the twelve months ended december  were approximately  as compared to approximately  for the twelve months ended december  primarily due to increased power purchases 
increases in capacity factor and purchased power increased sales of electricity by approximately to  kwhs in as compared to  kwhs in the company also realized a higher average selling price in during the twelve months ended december   the average selling price increased to cents per kwh as compared to an average selling price of cents per kwh for the twelve months ended december  great bay s cost of power determined by dividing total operating expenses by kwhs sold during the applicable period decreased to cents per kwh in as compared to cents per kwh in this decrease was primarily the result of increased kwhs sold in and lower operating expenses due to realized gains on firm forward contracts of approximately  in as compared to higher operating expenses in due to unrealized losses on firm forward contracts of approximately  in expenses baycorp s total operating expenses for decreased approximately  or  in comparison with this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in purchased power expenses in as compared to and having only ten months of operations in purchased power expenses decreased approximately  or  from  in to  in this decrease was primarily attributable to the company  in anticipation of the sale of its seabrook assets  entering into fewer firm energy contracts in as compared to offsetting this reduction in expenses was a decrease in the gain on the mark to market of forward firm energy trading contracts 
in  the company recognized gains on firm forward energy trading contracts of  as compared to  in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of firm energy contracts that the company was a party to in as compared to production and transmission costs decreased approximately  or  from  in to  in depreciation and amortization charges decreased approximately  or  from  in to  in taxes other than income decreased  or  from  in to  in these decreases in seabrook related operating costs were primarily related to the company s ownership of seabrook for ten months in as compared to twelve months in decommissioning cost accretion increased  or  from  in to  in this accretion is a non cash charge that reflected great bay s and little bay s liability related to the closure and decommissioning of the seabrook project in then current year dollars over the licensing period during which the seabrook project is licensed to operate 
decommissioning trust fund income decreased  or  from  in to  in the decrease in interest earned on the decommissioning trust fund reflected the lower rates of returns on investments 
administrative and general expenses increased approximately  or  from  in to  in this increase was primarily attributable to million of non cash compensation expense related to stock options offset by reduced expenses attributable to ownership of seabrook for only ten months during interest and dividend income increased approximately  or  from  in to  in  primarily due to higher average cash balances  including the proceeds from the sale of the seabrook assets in november equity loss in baycorp s houstonstreet investment was  in when the company invested an additional  cash in houstonstreet 
the company deconsolidated houstonstreet in and accounts for its investment in houstonstreet using the equity method 
there were no investments made by the company in houstonstreet in other deductions decreased approximately  to a net deduction in of  as compared to a net deduction in of  this decrease is due to ten months of expenses at seabrook in and lower admin fees charged to houstonstreet

the company realized a gain on the sale of its seabrook assets of approximately  see item  recent developments sale of seabrook 
baycorp s total operating expenses for decreased approximately  or  in comparison with this decrease was primarily the result of the non cash charge to earnings for unrealized gains losses on firm energy trading contracts 
in  the company realized gains on firm forward energy trading contracts of  and total operating expenses were reduced by this amount 
in  total operating expenses were higher because the company recorded unrealized losses on firm forward energy trading contracts of  as of december   the company held numerous firm forward energy trading contracts to deliver power in the company had no firm forward energy trading contracts as of december  production and transmission costs decreased approximately  or  from  in to  in purchased power expenses increased approximately  or  from  in to  in this increase was primarily attributable to the extended duration of the refueling outage that began on october  a return to full power was expected on november  the outage was extended when damage to one of the plant s emergency diesel generators occurred  requiring an extensive repair effort 
the seabrook project returned to full power on february  in order to cover some of its firm energy contracts and to secure cash to cover some of its operating costs in the first half of  great bay executed a purchase power agreement with select in february whereby great bay sold mws of energy associated with seabrook to select in exchange for mws of energy associated with millstone unit and mws of energy associated with millstone unit the term of this agreement was april  through december  see item  pre november and current business purchased power agreements 
administrative and general expenses increased approximately  or  from  in to  in this increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with employee turnover and retirements at the seabrook project in and a bad debt expense of  to establish a reserve for bad debts specific to enron 
see item  recent developments 
there was no similar charge in depreciation and amortization charges decreased approximately  or  from  in to  in this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in fixed asset values 
taxes other than income decreased  or  from  in to  in this decrease was due to the continued reduction in seabrook property taxes resulting from prior year negotiations between the management of the seabrook project and the towns of seabrook  hampton and hampton falls  new hampshire to reduce the assessed value of the seabrook project 
decommissioning cost accretion decreased  or  to  in as compared to  in this accretion is a non cash charge that reflects great bay s liability related to the closure and decommissioning of the seabrook project in current year dollars over the licensing period during which the seabrook project is licensed to operate 
decommissioning trust fund income decreased  or  to  in as compared to  in the decrease in interest earned on the decommissioning trust fund reflected the lower rates of returns on investments 
interest and dividend income decreased approximately  or  from  in to  in  primarily due to lower average monthly cash balances and lower interest rates in as compared although the company s cash balance at december  of  was approximately greater than its cash balance at december   the company s cash balance during the first half of was adversely affected by the late and early outage and was favorably affected by strong operations at seabrook during the second half of equity loss in baycorp s houstonstreet investment was  in as compared to  in as of december   the company owned of houstonstreet 
the company recognized its ownership share of houstonstreet s losses of  in as a result of its capital raising activities in  on december  houstonstreet sold an amount of its own stock such that baycorp no longer had majority ownership in or control over houstonstreet 
the company deconsolidated houstonstreet  and started accounting for this investment on the equity method effective for the full year ended december  the company s equity method investment upon deconsolidation was negative houstonstreet s losses exceeded the company s investment in houstonstreet and the company wrote its investment to zero 
as a result  an equity loss in investment of  was reflected in the company s financial statements for other income deductions decreased approximately  to a net deduction in of  as compared to other income in of  this decrease in other income is primarily due to lower administrative fees charged to houstonstreet in as compared to and fewer sales of miscellaneous unit equipment at seabrook in as compared to net operating losses for federal income tax purposes  as of december   the company had net operating loss carry forwards nols of approximately million  which are scheduled to expire between and because the company has experienced one or more ownership changes  within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  an annual limitation is imposed on the ability of the company to use million of these carryforwards 
the company estimates that the annual limitation on the use of million of the company s nols is approximately million per year 
any unused portion of the million annual limitation applicable to the company s restricted nols is available for use in future years until such nols are scheduled to expire 
changes in ownership occurring in could result in further limitation  including a complete limitation on its ability to utilize its nols 
whether the company incurs an ownership change under section is not within the company s control and there can be no assurance that such a change and resulting loss of the company s ability to utilize its nols will not occur 
liquidity and capital resources baycorp s subsidiary  great bay  sold most of its power in the northeast united states short term wholesale power market 
the cash generated from electricity sales by great bay was sufficient to meet the company s ongoing cash requirements in the principal factor affecting liquidity in was the company s sale of its seabrook assets 
on november   the company closed the sale of its interests in seabrook and received cash consideration of approximately million for its interests in the seabrook project 
see recent developments sale of seabrook 
baycorp s total cash increased approximately  during  and as of december   the company had approximately  million in cash and cash equivalents 
the company had net income in of  net income included the gain on the sale of the seabrook assets of approximately  non cash charges to income included  for depreciation and amortization   for nuclear fuel amortization   for decommissioning cost accretion and non cash compensation expense of approximately  for the variable accounting of certain employee stock options 
in addition  there was a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately  and a increase in taxes accrued of approximately  offsetting these non cash charges to income were cash charges including approximately  in fixed asset purchases   for nuclear fuel purchases and  for decommissioning interest 
there was an approximate  increase in prepaids and other assets 
this increase was primarily due to amounts put into escrow for costs associated with the sale of seabrook assets 
great bay s decommissioning payments totaled approximately  baycorp received approximately  in from the exercise of stock options to purchase  shares of baycorp common stock by employees of the company 
also in  baycorp repurchased  shares of its stock for approximately  on january  the company announced a self tender offer to purchase up to  of its common stock shares 
under the terms of the offer  baycorp shareholders could offer to sell to baycorp all or a portion of the shares that they owned at a price of per share in cash 
the offer was expected to close on march  due to the overwhelming response to the tender and the significant proration that would have been required to preserve the company s net operating loss carryforwards  the board of directors decided that it would not exercise its discretion to effect a proration for that purpose and on march   extended the offer 
the extension allowed shareholders additional time to either tender shares that had not been tendered or withdraw shares already tendered 
the final result of the tender offer was announced on march  baycorp exercised its right to purchase up to an additional of its outstanding shares  and accepted  shares of common stock  including options tendered by directors  officers and employees for repurchase  in the tender 
funds were distributed to tendering shareholders and shares not accepted in the tender were returned to shareholders beginning on march  the company distributed approximately  the company is presently uncertain about the future direction of the business following the sale of seabrook and the company s issuer tender offer 
among the company s available alternatives following the completion of its issuer tender offer are to acquire regulated utility assets or other energy related investments  including the development of its houstonstreet subsidiary  or to liquidate 
if the company sought to invest in energy related investments  the company s cash remaining following the tender offer might be insufficient to acquire such assets 
in such case  the company could seek to raise additional funds through debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining additional financing 
if the company is not successful in obtaining additional financing  the company would not be able to pursue its desired investments 
in such case  the company would consider all of the options then available  including liquidation 
alternatively  following the completion of the issuer tender offer  the company may decide to liquidate the company s remaining assets rather than pursue additional investment opportunities 
if the company decided to liquidate following the tender offer  the cash available following the offer would need to be reserved to pay for the expected expenses of a liquidation of the company 
the board of directors plans to discuss the strategic direction of the company following the tender offer 
the company has reduced the number of employees from eleven as of december  to nine as of december  and to seven as of march  the company relocated in march to smaller office space in portsmouth  new hampshire 
certain factors that may affect future results this annual report contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the results of baycorp and or its subsidiaries to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below and elsewhere in this report 
history of losses 
baycorp reported operating income for and prior to  baycorp had never reported an operating profit for any year since its incorporation 
liquidity need 
as of december   baycorp had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments 
the company believes that such cash  together with the anticipated proceeds from the sale of electricity by great bay power marketing less cash paid to shareholders in tender offer  will be sufficient to enable the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries to meet their cash requirements in the direction of the company s business and circumstances  foreseen or unforeseen  may cause cash requirements to be materially higher than anticipated  the company or its wholly owned subsidiaries would be required to raise additional capital  either through a debt financing or an equity financing  to meet ongoing cash requirements 
in that event  the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries would likely need to raise additional capital from outside sources 
there is no assurance that the company or its subsidiaries would be able to raise such capital or that the terms on which any additional capital is available would be acceptable 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  dilution to then existing stockholders will result 
primary reliance on a single asset 
baycorp s principal source of revenue is its wholesale electricity trading business  which depends in large part on great bay power marketing s contract to sell power to unitil power corporation 
accordingly  baycorp s results of operations significantly depend on the successful and continued performance under the unitil contract 
risks associated with post closing obligations from the seabrook sale 
on november   great bay and little bay sold their interests in the seabrook project 
in the purchase and sale agreement for the seabrook project  the buyer  fpl energy seabrook  llc  agreed to indemnify great bay and little bay against certain claims specified in the agreement 
great bay and little bay also agreed to indemnify fpl energy seabrook against certain claims specified in the purchase and sale agreement 
if a claim is brought against great bay and little bay for which fpl energy seabrook is required to indemnify great bay and little bay but fpl energy seabrook fails to provide such indemnity  or if great bay is required to indemnify fpl energy seabrook pursuant to the agreement  then the company s results of operations could be materially different 
in addition  great bay and little bay have deposited funds into an escrow account for the payment of seabrook expenses incurred prior to closing 
the amount escrowed was based on an estimate of those expenses 
should actual expenses be greater than the amount escrowed  additional funds will be required 
extensive government regulation 
the electric energy industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal and state agencies 

great bay power marketingis subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc and  as a result  is required to file with ferc all contracts for the sale of electricity 
ferc s jurisdiction also includes  among other things  the sale  lease  merger  consolidation or other disposition of facilities  interconnection of certain facilities  accounts  service and property records 
risks related to houstonstreet 
houstonstreet s revenues depend on continued and expanded use of internet based wholesale energy trading platforms 
electronic trading of wholesale energy is new and evolving  and thus may not achieve widespread market acceptance or emerge as a sustainable business 
in addition  houstonstreet will need to enhance trading liquidity in order to increase and sustain revenues 
as a technology dependent business  houstonstreet s business could suffer due to computer or communications systems interruptions or failures  technological change or adverse competitive developments 
further  as electronic commerce evolves  federal  state and foreign agencies could adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy  content and taxation of products and services 
if enacted  government regulations could materially adversely affect houstonstreet s business 
although houstonstreet currently is not aware that it infringes any other patents  it is possible that houstonstreet s technology infringes patents held by third parties 
if houstonstreet were to be found infringing  the owner of the patent could sue houstonstreet for damages  prevent houstonstreet from making  selling or using the owner s patented technology or could impose substantial royalty fees for those privileges 
if any of the foregoing risks materialize  or other risks develop that adversely affect houstonstreet  or if houstonstreet fails to grow its revenues and net income  baycorp could lose all of the value of its investment in houstonstreet 
critical accounting policies preparation of the company s financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements is a summary of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the following is a discussion of the most critical accounting policies used historically by the company 
decommissioning based on the financial accounting standards board s fasb tentative conclusions  reflected on the february   exposure draft titled accounting for certain liabilities related to closure and removal of long lived assets great bay and little bay have historically recognized as a liability their proportionate share of the present value of the estimated cost of seabrook project decommissioning 
for great bay  the initial recognition of this liability was capitalized as part of the fair value of the utility plant at november  for little bay  the amount was provided for in the purchase price allocation 
new hampshire enacted a law in requiring the creation of a state managed fund to finance decommissioning of any nuclear units in the state 
the seabrook project s decommissioning estimate and funding schedule is subject to review each year by the new hampshire nuclear decommissioning financing committee ndfc 
this estimate is based on a number of assumptions 
changes in assumptions for such things as labor and material costs  technology  inflation and timing of decommissioning could cause these estimates to change  possibly materially  in the near term 
during november  the ndfc issued an order which established a decommissioning funding schedule in anticipation of the sale of a majority of the ownership interests in seabrook 
the ndfc set an accelerated funding schedule for the years through for the years and beyond  the funding schedule assumes contributions will be made until the order also established the requirement for a lump sum top off payment at closing 
the current estimated cost to decommission the seabrook project based on ndfc docket is approximately million in dollars  assuming for decommissioning funding purposes  a remaining year life for the facility and a future cost escalation of 
great bay and little bay  based on the initial exposure draft  recognized a liability based on the present value of the estimated future cash outflows required to satisfy their obligations using a risk free rate 
as of december   the estimated undiscounted cash outflows for great bay and little bay  for decommissioning  based on the november ndfc study  with decommissioning expenditures starting in and being completed in  was million  which discounted at an average rate of  over the funding period  to december   represented a liability of million reflected in the accompanying balance sheet 
as of december   and based on the prior ndfc study  the estimated undiscounted cash outflows for great bay and little bay  for decommissioning expenditures  starting in and being completed in was million  which discounted at an average rate of  over the funding schedule to december  represented a liability of million reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in accordance with the original exposure draft  the company s wholly owned subsidiaries recorded any adjustments to the decommissioning liability due to changes in estimates in the utility plant account 
great bay and little bay accreted their share of the seabrook project s decommissioning liability 
this accretion was a non cash charge and recognized their liability related to the closure and decommissioning of their nuclear plant in current year dollars over the licensing period of the plant 
the non cash accretion charge recorded in the accompanied consolidated statements of income was   and  for the years ended december   and the change in the accretion between years reflects adjustments to the estimated decommissioning by the ndfc 
funds collected by seabrook for decommissioning are deposited in an external irrevocable trust pending their ultimate use 
the earnings on the external trusts also accumulate in the fund balance 
the trust funds are restricted for use in paying the decommissioning of unit the investments in the trust are available for sale 
great bay and little bay had therefore reported their investment in trust fund assets at market value and any unrealized gains and losses are reflected in equity 
there was an unrealized holding gain of  as of december  that was realized in great bay and little bay were responsible for making decommissioning fund top off payments on or before the due date of the sale closing and to transfer their respective decommissioning trust funds to fpl energy seabrook 
fpl energy seabrook assumed all decommissioning liability for the acquired portion of seabrook including the requirement that it provide an appropriate future funding assurance subject to the approval of the ndfc 
fpl energy seabrook provided a parent company guaranty that it will fully fund its ownership share of the projected cost of decommissioning in a manner consistent with new hampshire statutory requirements 
stock options the company accounts for its stock option plans under apb no 
and as such no compensation cost has been recognized for options granted at fair market value that have not been modified 
the company has repriced certain options  accelerated the vesting of others  made limited recourse loans for certain individuals to exercise options and issued contingent options 
in accordance with apb and fin  the company has recorded compensation expense related to these options 
compensation expense was   and  for  and  respectively 
seabrook outage costs the company s historical operating results and the comparability of these results on an interim and annual basis have been directly impacted by the operations of the seabrook project  including the cyclical refueling outages generally months apart as well as unscheduled outages 
during outage periods at the seabrook project  great bay and little bay had no electricity for resale from the seabrook project and consequently no related revenues 
therefore the impact of outages on the company s and great bay s and little bay s results of operations and financial position were  at times  materially adverse 
great bay and little bay accrued for the incremental costs of the seabrook project s scheduled outages over the periods between those outages 
however  great bay and little bay continue to expense the normal seabrook operating and maintenance expenses as incurred 
therefore  the company incurred losses during scheduled outage periods as a result of the combination of the lack of revenue and the recognition of normal recurring operation and maintenance costs as well as the continuing depreciation of the utility plant 
at the seabrook project  a scheduled refueling outage began on may  seabrook resumed full operating capacity on june  the outage cost approximately million 
the company s share was approximately million
