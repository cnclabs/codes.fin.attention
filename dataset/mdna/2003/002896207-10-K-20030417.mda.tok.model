gross income fourth quarter the gross income rate gross income divided by net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year was  up basis points from last year s rate of 
the increase in gross income rate resulted largely from an increase in initial markup imu  partially offset by an increase in buying and occupancy costs  as a percent of sales 
continued progress in sourcing has been an important factor in improving the imu in all three concepts 
the company continued to make progress increasing the imu in hollister  where imu improved over basis points versus the fourth quarter of additionally  the company s less aggressive approach to promotions during the fourth quarter of fiscal resulted in selling at higher average retail prices compared to the fourth quarter of the increase in buying and occupancy costs  as a percent of sales  reflected the inability to leverage fixed costs such as rent  depreciation and other real estate related charges with a comp store decrease 
the company ended the fourth quarter of with inventories up per gross square foot versus the fourth quarter of at cost 
fourth quarter the gross income rate during the fourth quarter of was  down from for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to an increase in the markdown rate  attributable to the expected higher level of promotional business 
the planned promotional strategies for the quarter resulted in selling at lower average retail prices 
for the quarter  average unit retail prices decreased in the low double digits 
additionally  buying and occupancy costs  expressed as a percentage of net sales  increased as a result of the inability to leverage fixed expenses with lower sales volume per average store 
these decreases were partially offset by higher imu and tight control of inventory 
the increase in imu was a result of continued improvement in the sourcing of merchandise  particularly in womens 
the tight control of inventory resulted in inventories being down per gross square foot at year end as compared with year end these low levels of inventory provided downside profit protection as season end merchandise was significantly lower on a per square foot basis in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in fiscal for fiscal  the gross income rate was versus in the increase was driven by improvements in imu that were almost fully offset by increased buying and occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales 
tight control of inventory also protected gross income as the company chased inventory through most of the first half of fiscal for the fiscal year  the gross income rate decreased to from in the decrease was primarily attributable to higher buying and occupancy costs 
buying and occupancy costs increased  as a percentage of net sales  due to the deleveraging created by the decrease in comparable store sales 
the decrease was almost entirely offset by higher imu as a result of continued improvements in sourcing merchandise that reduced costs 
the other factors in protecting gross income were tight control of inventory  which resulted in disciplined markdown control  and lower inventory shrinkage as a result of the company s continued emphasis on in store operational controls 
general  administrative and store operating expenses fourth quarter the fourth quarter general  administrative and store operating expense rate general  administrative and store operating expenses divided by net sales was compared to in the fourth quarter of the increase in rate versus resulted primarily from an increase in home office expenses  largely due to higher bonuses resulting from improved financial performance 
during the fourth quarter of  store payroll hours were reduced by per average abercrombie fitch adult store and per average kids store 
store hours are managed on a weekly basis in order to match hours with sales volume 
the control of payroll hours helped mitigate the effect of negative comps on the store expense rate 
efficiencies were also recognized in the distribution center and in the direct business 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  productivity  as measured in units processed per labor hour  was higher than the fourth quarter of for the quarter  more units were processed than the comparable period in with fewer labor hours

savings were also recognized in the new distribution center and in the direct business 
during the fourth quarter  productivity in the distribution center  as measured in units processed per labor hour  was over higher than fourth quarter in the direct business  fulfillment costs per order were down by over 
these savings in general  administrative and store operating expenses were partially offset by marketing costs incurred as part of the promotional strategy implemented during the fourth quarter of fourth quarter s general  administrative and store operating expenses were unfavorably affected by one time expenses related to the move to the new distribution center and home office and the inclusion of a th week in the fourth quarter of fiscal the full year general  administrative and store operating expense rate in was versus in the rate increase resulted from an increase in store expenses  as a percentage of sales  due to the inability to leverage fixed costs on a comp store sales decrease  as well as higher legal and incentive compensation expenses

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
since actual results may differ from those estimates  the company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available 
the company s significant accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements see note 
the company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for  primarily with either cash or credit card 
catalogue and e commerce sales are recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise 
amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and the related costs are classified as cost of goods sold 
employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue 
the company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable 
inventory valuation inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a first in first out basis  utilizing the retail method 
the retail method of inventory valuation is an averaging technique applied to different categories of inventory 
at a f  the averaging is determined at the stock keeping unit sku level by averaging all costs for each sku 
an initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio 
permanent markdowns  when taken  reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship 
the use of the retail method and the recording of markdowns effectively values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the company further reduces inventory by recording an additional markdown reserve using the retail carrying value of inventory from the season just passed 
markdowns on this carryover inventory represent estimated future anticipated selling price declines 
additionally  as part of inventory valuation  an inventory shrinkage estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items 
inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including  among others  initial markup  markdowns and shrinkage  which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
management believes that this inventory valuation method provides a conservative inventory valuation as it preserves the cost to retail relationship in ending inventory 
property and equipment depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis  using service lives ranging principally from years for leasehold improvements and years for other property and equipment 
beneficial leaseholds represent the present value of the excess of fair market rent over contractual rent of existing stores at the purchase of the abercrombie fitch business by the limited  inc now known as limited brands  inc  the limited and are being amortized over the lives of the related leases 
the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized 
long lived assets are reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable 
factors used in the evaluation include  but are not limited to  management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
income taxes income taxes are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the company s operations 
significant examples of this concept include capitalization policies for various tangible and intangible costs  income and expense recognition and inventory valuation methods 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
the effective tax rate utilized by the company reflects management s judgment of the expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions
