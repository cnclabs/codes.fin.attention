item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of mortgage debt related to our properties 

table of contents our properties are leased to local  national and foreign companies engaged in a variety of businesses including computer systems design  management  insurance  broadcasting and telecommunications  legal services  and information services 
as of december   we had approximately  tenants  with the following tenants representing approximately of our aggregate annualized based rent and approximately of our total net rentable square footage international business machines  kaiser foundation health plan  verizon communications  mci worldcom  northrop grumman corporation  general services administration  aspen systems corporation and american management systems 
leases typically contain provisions permitting tenants to renew expiring leases at prevailing market rates 
approximately of our total leased rentable square footage is under full service gross leases under which tenants typically pay for all real estate taxes and operating expenses above those for an established base year or expense stop 
our remaining square footage is under triple net and modified gross leases 
triple net and modified gross leases are those where tenants pay not only base rent  but also some or all real estate taxes and operating expenses of the leased property 
tenants generally reimburse us the full direct cost  without regard to a base year or expense stop  for use of lighting  heating and air conditioning during non business hours  and for on site monthly employee and visitor parking 
we are generally responsible for structural repairs 
our in place leases have terms  on average  ranging from five to seven years in length

subject to supply and demand  we expect to have the total projected costs of our properties under development comprise approximately of our total market capitalization at any point in time 
due to current market conditions  we have scaled back our development activity  and as a result  at december   we had  net rentable square feet of properties under development with an estimated development cost of million  or of our december  total market capitalization 
in addition to developing new properties  we are involved in substantial levels of construction activity in the normal course of owning and operating buildings 
such activity includes building out interior space for tenants  expansions of existing buildings  and repairs necessary to upgrade or maintain the quality of the buildings

table of contents as of december   we have incurred million of the total estimated cost of our development properties 
insurance we have and will keep in force comprehensive insurance  including liability  fire  workers compensation  extended coverage  rental loss and  when available on reasonable commercial terms  flood  wind  earthquake and terrorism insurance  with policy specifications  limits  exclusions and deductibles customarily carried for similar properties 
we currently maintain insurance to cover environmental conditions and business interruption if and when they occur 
this policy covers both governmental and third party claims associated with the covered environmental conditions 
our real property insurance policies exclude earthquake coverage for properties located within california 
as a result  we maintain a million blanket earthquake policy on the properties we own in northern and southern california 
our real property insurance policies exclude terrorism coverage 
however  we maintain a million blanket stand alone terrorism policy on the properties we own 
certain types of losses  however  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as acts of war  are either uninsurable or the cost of obtaining insurance is so high that it is more prudent to accept the risk of loss 
if more terrorists incidents occur  however  future insurance policies purchased by us may expressly exclude hostile acts  and it may be impossible to obtain insurance covering terrorist attacks 
in addition  we would expect our insurance premiums to increase in the future  which may have an adverse impact on our cash flow 
we may not be able to purchase policies in the future with coverage limits and deductibles similar to those that were available before september  we believe that our properties as of the date of this filing are adequately insured in accordance with industry standards 
item legal proceedings neither we nor our affiliates other than in a representative capacity are presently subject to any material litigation 
to our knowledge  no litigation has been threatened against us or our affiliates other than routine actions and administrative proceedings  substantially all of which are expected to be covered by liability insurance and which  in the aggregate  are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

overview as an owner of real estate  the majority of our income and cash flow is derived from rental income received pursuant to tenant leases for space at our properties  and thus  our earnings would be negatively impacted by a deterioration of our rental income 
one or more factors could result in a deterioration of rental income including our failure to renew or execute new leases as current leases expire  our failure to renew or execute new leases with rental terms at or above the terms of in place leases  and tenant defaults 
our failure to renew or execute new leases as current leases expire or to execute new leases with rental terms at or above the terms of in place leases is dependent on factors such as the local economic climate  which may be adversely impacted by business layoffs or downsizing  industry slowdowns  changing demographics and other factors  and local real estate conditions  such as oversupply of office and industrial space or competition within the market 
the following are the markets in which our properties are located with the first market being the location of each regional office region market mid atlantic metropolitan washington dc  atlanta midwest chicago  suburban detroit southwest dallas fort worth  austin  denver  houston northern california oakland  sacramento southern california san diego  los angeles at december   we had million square feet of in place leases representing of the net rentable square feet of our operating properties 
our leases range in term from month to years with an average term of to years 
the million square feet of in place leases expire as follows square feet square feet in thousands thereafter 
table of contents if one or more tenants fail to pay their rent due to bankruptcy  weakened financial condition or otherwise  our income  cash flow and ability to make distributions would be negatively impacted 
at any time  a tenant may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  which could result in delays in rental payments or in the rejection and termination of such tenant leases 
on july   worldcom  inc announced that worldcom and substantially all of its active us subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us code in the united states bankruptcy court 
at the time of the announcement  worldcom subsidiaries had operating leases totaling  square feet in six of our properties 
in november  we received formal notice of rejection of approximately  square feet of worldcom related leases 
at december   we had six remaining office lease agreements with worldcom subsidiaries representing  square feet in five of our office properties 
annualized base rental revenue from these leases equates to approximately million  or less than of our annualized base rental revenue 
all rent due as of december  under the office lease agreements has been collected 
accruable rental income related to these leases totaled approximately  at december   all of which was reserved at december  our worldcom related office leases expire as follows  square feet expire in march   square feet expire in july   square feet expire in april  and  square feet expire at various times in base rental rates under these leases range from per square foot to per square foot 
in addition to the office lease agreements  we have rooftop antenna lease agreements with worldcom subsidiaries 
these leases expire at various dates through june  annualized rent from these leases equates to approximately  in january  we received formal notice of rejection of approximately  square feet of the worldcom related office leases expiring in at december   approximately  square feet of the  square feet  was sub leased to a tenant unaffiliated with worldcom 
as of the date of this filing  we are uncertain whether the remaining leases will be accepted or rejected in the bankruptcy proceedings or whether worldcom or its subsidiaries will continue to pay in accordance with the lease terms 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of prentiss properties trust  our operating partnership and our other consolidated subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included elsewhere in this form k 
however  certain of our significant accounting estimates are considered critical accounting estimates because the estimate requires our management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following impairment of long lived assets and the long lived assets to be disposed of  allowance for doubtful accounts  depreciable lives applied to real estate assets and improvements to real estate assets  initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired  and fair value of derivative instruments 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of real estate  leasehold improvements and land holdings are classified as long lived assets held for sale or long lived assets to be held and used 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we record assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
with respect to assets classified as held and used  we periodically review these assets to determine whether our carrying amount will be recovered 
all of our long lived assets were classified as held and used at december  our operating real estate  which comprises the majority of our long lived assets  had a carrying amount of billion at december  a long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
upon impairment  we would recognize an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to our estimate of its fair value 
our estimate of fair value and cash flows to be generated from our properties requires us to make assumptions related to future occupancy of our properties  future rental rates  tenant concessions  operating expenditures  property taxes  capital improvements  the ability of our tenants to perform pursuant to their lease obligations  the holding period of our properties and the proceeds to be generated from the eventual sale of our properties 
if one or more of our assumptions proves incorrect or if our assumptions change  the recognition of an impairment loss on one or more properties may be necessary in the future 
for assets classified as held and used  we have not recognized any impairment during the three year period ended december  during this same period  however  we classified two real estate assets as held for sale and recognized impairment losses totaling million in the aggregate 
the table below details the impairment losses recognized during the three years ended december  year ended december  in thousands impairment loss recognized included in gain from disposition of discontinued operations  net in the accompanying statement of income 
included in gain on sale of properties  net in the accompanying statement of income 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that we estimate to be uncollectible 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of accrued rental rate increases to be received over the life of in place leases as well as rents and operating cost recoveries due from tenants 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts considering such factors as credit quality of our tenants  delinquency of payment  historical trends and current economic conditions 
at december   we had total receivables of million and an allowance for doubtful accounts of million  resulting in a net receivable balance of million 
of the million in total receivables  million represents accrued rental rate increases to be received over the life of in place leases 
it is our policy to reserve all outstanding receivables that are days past due along with a portion of the remaining receivable balance that we feel is uncollectible based on our evaluation of the outstanding receivable balance 
in addition  we increase our allowance for doubtful accounts for accrued rental rate increases  if we determine such future rent is uncollectible 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if our assumptions  regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable  prove incorrect  we may experience write offs in excess of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the table below presents bad debt expense recognized during the three years ended december   which includes increases or decreases to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the table also presents our allowance for doubtful accounts at each period end 
year ended december  in thousands bad debt expense less bad debts realized during the period increase decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts at period end 
table of contents depreciable lives applied to real estate assets and improvements to real estate assets depreciation on buildings and improvements is provided under the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for office buildings and to years for industrial buildings 
significant betterments made to our real estate assets are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the betterment 
if our estimate of useful lives proves to be materially incorrect  the depreciation and amortization expense that we currently recognize would also prove to be materially incorrect 
a change in our estimate of useful lives would therefore  result in either an increase or decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and thus  an increase or decrease in earnings 
the table below presents real estate related depreciation and amortization expense  including depreciation and amortization expense related to discontinued operations  recognized during the three years ended december  year ended december  in thousands depreciation and amortization expense initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  which includes  within its scope  real estate acquisitions  we estimate at the date of acquisition the fair value of the various components of each real estate asset acquired and allocate the purchase price to each component accordingly 
generally this includes an allocation of the purchase price to land  building  leasing costs  leasehold improvements and to an intangible asset or liability representing the difference between the contractual in place leases and the fair value of such in place leases 
we determine the fair value of the components using a variety of methods and assumptions all of which result in a general approximation of fair value 
differing assumptions and methods could result in different estimates of fair value and thus  a different purchase price allocation 
financial accounting standards no 
is effective for business combinations for which the date of acquisition is july   or later 
during the period july  through december   we acquired three real estate properties 
based on our estimates of the fair value of the components of each real estate property acquired between july  and december   we allocated the purchase price as follows year ended december  in thousands land buildings and improvements leasing costs and leasehold improvements intangible asset liability fair value of derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  beginning january   we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability of expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings  and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
we assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with 
table of contents the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction 
for derivatives not designated as hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
to accomplish this objective  we use interest rate swaps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
during  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with a portion of our variable rate debt 
as of december   we did not have any derivatives designated as fair value hedges 
additionally  we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently  we do not have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges 
to determine the fair value of our derivative instruments  we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date 
for the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives  standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost  and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
future cash inflows or outflows from our derivative instruments depend upon future borrowing rates 
if assumptions about future borrowing rates prove to be materially incorrect  the recorded value of these agreements could also prove to be materially incorrect 
because we use the derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates  thus effectively fixing a portion of our variable interest rates  the impact of changes in future borrowing rates could result in our interest expense being either higher or lower than might otherwise have been incurred on our variable rate borrowings had the rates not been fixed 
the table below presents the amount by which cash payments made under our interest rate swap agreements exceeded cash receipts from our agreements  or conversely  the amount by which cash receipts exceeded cash payments made under our agreements during the three years ended december  the table also presents the estimated fair value of our in place swap agreements as of december   and year ended december  in thousands net cash paid received under our interest rate swap agreements fair value of interest rate swaps in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was included as a cumulative transition adjustment and recorded as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet on january

prior to march  we owned a non controlling interest in the joint venture owning the burnett plaza property  a million net rentable square foot office building located in our southwest region 
our interest was accounted for using the equity method of accounting and thus  our share of the results of operations from the property were included in the line item equity in income of joint ventures and unconsolidated subsidiaries on our consolidated statement of income 
on march   we purchased from burnett plaza vef iii  lp  an affiliate of lend lease real estate investments  its interest in the joint venture for a purchase price of approximately million

the property dispositions included property containing  net rentable square feet located in our mid atlantic region  properties containing  net rentable square feet in our midwest region  properties containing  net rentable square feet in our southern california region and all of the properties within our northeast region which included properties containing million net rentable square feet 
termination of merger 
on september   we entered into a termination and release agreement which provided for the termination of the agreement and plan of merger dated june   between us  our operating partnership  mack cali realty corporation  and mack cali realty  lp as part of the termination and release agreement  and pursuant to an escrow agreement dated september   mack cali deposited a million termination fee in escrow for our benefit

other significant events or transactions 
on november   we acquired north wacker  a  net rentable square foot office property located in our midwest region for a purchase price of approximately million 
the property was primarily leased to a single tenant whose intention was to vacate the property in september upon the expiration of the in place lease 
our intention was to convert and market the building for lease as a multi tenant property 
the property  which was vacated as intended  is currently leased 
the following is a discussion of the material changes in our consolidated statements of income and a discussion of the impact that the significant events or transactions  as described above  had on one or more line items of our consolidated statements of income when comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december  rental income 
rental income increased by million  or  from million to million 
the real estate acquisitions and development properties coming on line resulted in increases of million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million related to property dispositions during the period january  through december   a decrease of million related to our north wacker property and a decrease of million from our other properties relating primarily to occupancy declines in our portfolio 

table of contents property operating and maintenance 
property operating and maintenance costs increased by million  or  from million to million

other properties decreased by approximately  primarily as a result of the reassessment of certain property values by various taxing authorities 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  from million to million  primarily as a result of an increase in weighted average borrowings outstanding from the year ended december  to year ended december   accompanied by a decrease in capitalized interest from million to million for the respective periods

table of contents property 
real estate taxes related to our other properties increased by million primarily as a result of the reassessment of certain property values by various taxing authorities 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  from million to million primarily as a result of a decrease in weighted average borrowings outstanding from the year ended december  to the year end december   a decrease in the weighted average interest rate paid on outstanding borrowings from to and an increase in capitalized interest from million to million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by  or less than  from million to million

the proceeds received were recorded net of merger related cost totaling million 
during the year ended december   we received final distributions totaling million from the mack cali escrow account 
loss on investment in securities 
in november  we invested million in urban media communications corporation  a provider of broad band internet access to tenants of commercial office buildings 
as a result of urban media s purported inability to raise funding necessary to continue day to day operations  in december  we recognized a loss equal to of our investment in urban media 
minority interests 
minority interests increased by million  or  from million to million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the minority interest holders proportionate share of the increase in net income before discontinued operations  extraordinary items and minority interests from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   accompanied by the income allocation totaling  related to the series e preferred units issued in april discontinued operations

gain on sale of properties

it is our strategy to obtain the maximum value from each of our properties  which is occasionally achieved through the sale of a property 
during the year ended december   we sold properties totaling million net rentable square feet compared to properties totaling million net rentable square feet sold during 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is a result of net cash used in investing and financing activities exceeding cash provided by operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december net cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in net cash used in investing activities of million is due primarily to a decrease in cash generated from the sale of real estate of million  an increase of million in cash used to purchase real estate and mortgage loans  partially offset by a decrease of million in cash used in the development and redevelopment of real estate 
net cash used in financing activities totaled  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash used in financing activities of million is due primarily to net borrowings of million for the year ended december  compared to net repayments of million for the year ended december   an increase in cash generated from the sale of common shares of million  partially offset by an increase in cash used of million for the repurchase of our outstanding series c cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units in january net cash flow from operations represents the primary source of liquidity to fund distributions  debt service  capital improvements and non revenue enhancing tenant improvements 
we expect that our revolving credit facility will provide for funding of working capital and revenue enhancing tenant improvements  unanticipated cash needs as well as acquisitions and development costs 
our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring expenses  debt service requirements and the minimum distributions required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code 
our net cash flow from operations is generally derived from rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements from tenants and  to a limited extent  from fees generated by our office and industrial real estate management service business 
our net cash flow from operations is therefore dependent upon the occupancy level of our properties  the collectibility of rent from our tenants  the level of operating and other expenses  and other factors 
material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flow from operations 
such changes  in turn  would adversely affect our ability to fund distributions  debt service  capital improvements and non revenue enhancing tenant improvements 
in addition  a material adverse change in our net cash flow from operations may affect the financial performance covenants under our revolving credit facility 
if we fail to meet any of our financial performance covenants  our revolving credit facility may become unavailable to us  or the interest charged on the revolving credit facility may increase 
either of these circumstances could adversely affect our ability to fund working capital and revenue enhancing tenant improvements  unanticipated cash needs  acquisitions and development costs 
in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must distribute at least of our taxable income  excluding capital gains 
we expect to make distributions to our shareholders primarily based on our cash flow from operations distributed by our operating partnership 
we anticipate that our short term liquidity needs will be fully funded from cash flows provided by operating activities and  when necessary to fund shortfalls resulting from the timing of collections of accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business  from our revolving credit facility 
in the event that our cash flow needs exceed cash flows provided by operating activities  we may be forced to incur additional debt or sell real estate properties to fund such cash flow needs 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of activities  such as development  real estate acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other revenue enhancing capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and through the issuance of additional debt and equity securities 
we also intend to use proceeds from our revolving credit facility to fund real estate acquisitions  development  redevelopment  expansions and capital improvements on an interim basis 

table of contents debt financing financing strategy as of december   we had outstanding total indebtedness  including our pro rata share of joint venture debt  of approximately billion  or approximately of total market capitalization based on a common share price of per common share 
the amount of indebtedness that we may incur  and the policies with respect thereto  are not limited by our declaration of trust and bylaws  and are solely within the discretion of our board of trustees  limited only by various financial covenants in our credit agreements 
although it is our general policy to limit combined indebtedness plus our pro rata share of joint venture debt so that  at the time such debt is incurred  it does not exceed of our total market capitalization  we view ratios such as interest coverage and fixed charge coverage as more stable and indicative measures of our ability to meet debt obligations 
for the year ended december   our interest coverage earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization over interest expense and fixed charge coverage earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization over interest expense and perpetual preferred distributions totaled and times  respectively 
our credit agreements limit total indebtedness to of total assets and require an interest coverage ratio of at least to we have in place a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks 
the facility  which was renewed in may  matures in may the facility has an initial interest rate of libor plus basis points 
additionally  we are required to pay an average unused commitment fee of basis points per annum if the unused portion of the credit facility is greater than million 
the fee is reduced to basis points per annum if the unused portion is less than or equal to million  but greater than million 
the fee is further reduced to basis points per annum if the unused portion is less than or equal to million 
during the year ended december   we had net borrowings under our credit facility of million and an outstanding balance of million at december  resulting in an available balance of million

table of contents the majority of our fixed rate secured debt contains prepayment provisions based on the greater of a yield maintenance penalty or of the outstanding loan amount 
the yield maintenance penalty essentially compensates the lender for the difference between the fixed rate under the loan and the yield that the lender would receive if the lender reinvested the prepaid loan balance in us treasury securities with a similar maturity as the loan 
under our loan agreements  we are required to satisfy various affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on total indebtedness  total collateralized indebtedness and cash distributions  as well as obligations to maintain certain minimum tangible net worth and certain minimum interest coverage ratios 
our credit agreements limit total indebtedness to of total assets and require a debt service coverage ratio of at least to our credit agreements provide for a day period to cure a default caused by our failure to punctually and properly perform  observe and comply with the covenants contained therein 
the agreements also provide for an additional day period if such failure is not capable of being cured within days and we are diligently pursuing the cure thereof 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  hedging activities to manage interest rate risk  we may employ options  forwards  interest rate swaps  caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying interest rate exposure 
we undertake a variety of borrowings from revolving credit facilities  to medium and long term financings 
to manage overall interest rate exposure  we use interest rate instruments  typically interest rate swaps  to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
interest rate differentials that arise under these swap contracts are recognized as interest expense over the life of the contracts 
we may employ forwards or purchased options to hedge qualifying anticipated transactions 
gains and losses are deferred and recognized in net income in the same period that the anticipated transaction occurs  expires or is otherwise terminated 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts and fair values of our derivative financial instruments 
the notional amount provides an indication of the extent of our involvement in these instruments as of the balance sheet date  but does not represent exposure to credit  interest rate or market risks 
notional amount swap rate paid fixed effective fixed rate swap rate received variable at december  swap maturity fair value in thousands million august million september million september million july million july million march million march total capital improvements our properties require periodic investments of capital for tenant related capital expenditures and for general capital improvements 
the majority of capital required relates to tenant related capital expenditures and is dependent upon our leasing activity 
our leasing activity is a function of the percentage of our in place leases expiring in current and future periods accompanied by our exposure to tenant defaults and our ability to increase the average occupancy of our portfolio 
for the year ended december  capital expenditures related to our in service properties totaled million 
we classify capital expenditures for in service properties as non incremental and incremental revenue enhancing capital expenditures representing our estimate of recurring versus non recurring capital requirements  respectively 
our non incremental and incremental capital expenditures for the year ended december  totaled approximately million and million  respectively

table of contents funds from operations funds from operations is a non gaap financial measure and as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  means net income  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding extraordinary items as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships  joint ventures and subsidiaries 
we believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors and our management as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  financing and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
our funds from operations is not comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits that do not define funds from operations exactly as we do 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  funds from operations should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
the following is a reconciliation of net income  the most directly comparable gaap measure  to funds from operations year ended december  in thousands funds from operations net income add real estate depreciation and amortization real estate depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures minority interests extraordinary items less merger termination fee  net gain on sales dividend on perpetual preferred units funds from operations includes real estate depreciation and amortization included in continuing operations and real estate depreciation and amortization included in discontinued operations 
represents the minority interests applicable to the common and preferred unit holders of the operating partnership 
although the fee is not considered an extraordinary item in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  it is our opinion that it is appropriate to exclude the fee from funds from operations 
funds from operations increased by million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  and increased by million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  as a result of the factors discussed in the analysis of operating results

the statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the impact from the implementation of this statement  which we believe will not have a material impact on our financial statements  will be dependent upon whether or not we enter into transactions that qualify as exit or disposal activities as defined in this statement 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure

finally  this statement amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
on january   we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation and have elected to apply this method using the prospective method as prescribed in financial accounting standards no 
the prospective method allows for the application of the recognition provisions of financial accounting standards no 
to all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied 
the transition and disclosure provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions of this statement are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the impact from the implementation of this statement  which we believe will not have a material impact on our financial statements  will be dependent upon the amount of awards granted  modified  or settled on or subsequent to january in november  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee

the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the impact from the implementation of this interpretation  which we believe will not have a material impact on our financial statements  will be dependent upon guarantees we enter into subsequent to december  in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires consolidation of an entity by an enterprise if that enterprise will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both

at december   the operating partnership held a non voting interest in prentiss properties resources which we accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
effective january   we acquired the remaining outstanding interest in prentiss properties resources

had this transaction not occurred  prentiss properties resources would have been subject to consolidation as prescribed in this interpretation 
application of and changes in law regarding ownership of subsidiaries and qualifications as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we were organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended  beginning with our taxable year ending december  and through the date hereof 
the internal revenue code sets forth various income  asset  ownership  and distribution tests with respect to which a reit must comply in order to maintain its status as a reit 
although the internal revenue service  based upon its interpretation of the relevant judicial and administrative authorities  may take the position that a reit has failed a particular qualification test  the facts and circumstances upon which such a determination would be based are controlled by the reit 
to the extent that a reit does not comply with a particular test  the decision to take an action that would prevent compliance or to not take an action that would have allowed compliance will be directly within the control of the reit 
we are unaware of any instance in which a reit has lost its qualification as a reit due to the failure of one of the statutory qualification tests under the internal revenue code 
we believe that our current and proposed method of operation will enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
the reit modernization act effective for and later years  contains several provisions affecting reits 
the reit modernization act allows a subsidiary to perform services for tenants without disqualifying the rents received as under prior law 
these subsidiaries  called taxable reit subsidiaries  are subject to taxation and are limited in the amount of debt and rental payments between the reit and the taxable reit subsidiaries 
the fair market value of all taxable reit subsidiaries securities cannot exceed of the reit s fair market value 
existing subsidiaries could be grandfathered in a one time tax free conversion 
they are not subject to these limitations  unless engaging in a new line of business or increasing assets 
if either of these events occurs  new restrictions on debt and rental payments will apply to these entities as well 
the reit modernization act also reduced the reit taxable income distribution requirement from to 
inflation most of the leases on our properties require tenants to pay increases in operating expenses  including common area charges and real estate taxes  thereby reducing the impact on us of the adverse effects of inflation 
leases also vary in term from one month to years  further reducing the impact on us of the adverse effects of inflation 
risk factors an investment in us involves various risks 
the following describes factors that in some cases may have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual operating results and could cause such results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements 
this list is not necessarily exhaustive  and new risk factors emerge from time to time 
we cannot assure you that the factors described below are all of the material risks to us at any specific point in time 
you should carefully consider the following factors which qualify in their entirety each forward looking statement 

table of contents risks related to general business operations the geographic concentration of our properties in markets which are in economic decline could have a material adverse effect on operating performance 
properties located in the mid atlantic  midwest  southwest  northern california and southern california provided approximately    and  respectively  of total revenues for the year ended december  like other real estate markets  these commercial real estate markets have experienced economic downturns in the past  and future declines in any of these economies or real estate markets could adversely affect our cash available for distribution 
our financial performance and ability to make distributions to our shareholders are  therefore  particularly sensitive to the economic conditions in these markets 
the local economic climate  which may be adversely impacted by business layoffs or downsizing  industry slowdowns  changing demographics and other factors  and local real estate conditions  such as oversupply of or reduced demand for office  industrial and other competing commercial properties  may affect our revenues and the value of our properties  including properties to be acquired or developed 
we cannot assure you that these local economies will grow in the future 
our acquisition of new properties and lack of operating history give rise to difficulties in predicting revenue potential 
from time to time  we acquire office properties 
these acquisitions could fail to perform in accordance with expectations 
if we fail to accurately estimate occupancy levels  operating costs or costs of improvements to bring an acquired property up to the standards established for its intended market position  the operating performance of the property may be below our expectations 
acquired properties may have characteristics or deficiencies affecting their valuation or revenue potential that we have not yet discovered 
we cannot assure you that the operating performance of acquired properties will increase or be maintained under our management 
during  we acquired from burnett plaza vef iii  lp  its interest in the burnett plaza joint venture 
this acquisition brought to our interest in the joint venture which owns a million net rentable square foot office property in downtown fort worth 
in addition we acquired a  net rentable square foot office property located in northern virginia 
our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to integrate successfully our new acquisitions into our existing management structure 
some of our properties have relatively short or no operating history under our management 
we have had limited control over the operation of these buildings 
our redevelopment  development and construction activities may give rise to unexpected costs and can make it difficult to predict revenue potential 
we redevelop  develop and construct primarily office buildings 
the risks associated with these activities include abandonment of redevelopment or development opportunities resulting in a loss of invested capital  construction costs of a property exceeding original estimates potentially resulting in yields on invested capital lower than expected  occupancy rates and rents at a newly renovated or completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable  financing may not be available on favorable terms for redevelopment or development of a property possibly increasing the projected cost of the project  permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms to replace short term construction loans and construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  resulting in increased interest expense and construction costs  
table of contents all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations may not be obtained or may not be obtained on a timely basis resulting in possible delays  decreased profitability and increased management time and attention  and increased management time required for such activities may divert their attention from other aspects of our business 
these risks and potential costs may adversely affect our results of operations 
cost increases or revenue decreases can adversely affect property yields and values 
the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred 
if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet operating expenses  including debt service  tenant improvements  leasing commissions and other capital expenditures  we may have to borrow additional amounts to cover fixed costs  and our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected 
factors which may affect our revenues and the value of our properties include the national  state and local economic climate and real estate conditions  such as oversupply of or reduced demand for space and changes in market rental rates  the perceptions of prospective tenants of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of our properties  our ability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  including coverages for earthquakes and terrorist acts  our ability to collect on a timely basis all rent from tenants  the expense of periodically renovating  repairing and reletting spaces  increasing operating costs  including real estate taxes and utilities  which may or may not be passed through to tenants  and our compliance with the laws  changes in the tax laws  fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of financing 
certain significant expenditures associated with our properties  such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental revenues from our properties 
tenant defaults and bankruptcy could cause rent collection difficulties 
the risk that some of our tenants may declare bankruptcy is higher because of the recent decline in the economy 
a significant portion of our income is derived from rental income on our properties 
as of december   we had approximately  tenants  with the following tenants representing approximately of our aggregate annualized base rent and approximately of our total net rentable square footage leased international business machines  kaiser foundation health plan  verizon communications  mci worldcom  northrop grumman corporation  general services administration  aspen systems corporation and american management systems 
currently  we derive approximately of our total annualized base rental revenue from tenants in the computer systems design  broadcasting  telecommunications  management  scientific  technical and insurance industries 
as a result  our distributable cash flow and ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected if any of these industries is materially adversely affected by the economy or if a significant number of our tenants fail to pay their rent due to bankruptcy  weakened financial condition or otherwise 
our leases generally do not contain restrictions designed to ensure the creditworthiness of our tenants 
from time to 
table of contents time a tenant may experience a downturn in its business 
such a downturn may weaken its financial condition  and it may stop paying rent when due 
in addition  at any time  a tenant may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  which could result in delays in rental payments or in the rejection and termination of such tenant leases 
these events would cause a reduction in our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions to our shareholders 
we cannot assure you that tenants will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future or  if any tenants file  that they will affirm their leases and continue to make rental payments in a timely manner 
on july   worldcom  inc announced that worldcom and substantially all of its active us subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us code in the united states bankruptcy court 
at the time of the announcement  worldcom subsidiaries had operating leases totaling  square feet in six of our properties 
in november  we received formal notice of rejection of approximately  square feet of worldcom related leases 
at december   we had six remaining office lease agreements with worldcom subsidiaries representing  square feet in five of our office properties 
annualized base rental revenue from these leases equates to approximately million  or less than of our annualized base rental revenue 
all rent due as of december  under the office lease agreements has been collected 
accruable rental income related to these leases totaled approximately  at december   all of which was reserved at december  our worldcom related office leases expire as follows  square feet expire in march   square feet expire in july   square feet expire in april  and  square feet expire at various times in base rental rates under these leases range from per square foot to per square foot 
in addition to the office lease agreements  we have rooftop antenna lease agreements with worldcom subsidiaries 
these leases expire at various dates through june  annualized rent from these leases equates to approximately  in january  we received formal notice of rejection of approximately  square feet of the worldcom related office leases expiring in at december   approximately  square feet of the  square feet  was sub leased to a tenant unaffiliated with worldcom 
as of the date of this filing  we are uncertain whether the remaining leases will be accepted or rejected in the bankruptcy proceedings or whether worldcom or its subsidiaries will continue to pay in accordance with the lease terms 
property maintenance costs may escalate beyond our ability to recover such costs through rents 
our properties are subject to increases in operating expenses  such as cleaning  electricity  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  elevator repair and maintenance  insurance and administrative costs  and other general costs associated with security  landscaping  and repairs and maintenance 
due to the terrorist acts of september   we have experienced increases in insurance premiums 
while our tenants generally are obligated to pay a portion of the escalating costs  there can be no assurance that our tenants will agree to pay such costs upon renewal or that new tenants will agree to pay such costs 
if operating expenses increase  the local rental market may limit the extent to which rents may be increased to meet increased expenses without decreasing occupancy rates 
our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected if operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues 
non renewal of leases and non reletting of space could adversely affect our rental revenues 
we are subject to several risks upon expiration of leases for space located at our properties 
the leases may not be renewed  the space may not be relet or the terms of renewal or reletting  including the costs of required renovations  may be less favorable than current lease terms 
leases on a total of approximately of the total net rentable square feet in our properties will expire during if we are unable to relet promptly or renew the leases for a particular property or properties  if the rental rates upon such renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates or if our budgets for these purposes prove to be inadequate  then our cash flow and ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders may be adversely affected 

table of contents some of our competitors in markets in which we have properties may have newer  better located or better capitalized properties 
numerous office and industrial properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants to lease space 
in each market we compete on a number of factors including rental rates  tenant concession allowances  quality and location of buildings  quality of property management and other economic and non economic factors 
our major competitors in each market include the following companies segment competitors mid atlantic boston properties  carramerica realty corp  equity office properties  vornado realty trust midwest carramerica realty corp  duke weeks realty corp  equity office properties  great lakes reit  john buck co  prime group southwest carramerica realty corp  crescent real estate equities  equity office properties  lincoln property co  trammell crow co 
northern california boston properties  carramerica realty corp  equity office properties  shorenstein co 
southern california arden realty  carramerica realty corp  equity office properties  kilroy realty corp 
this competition could have an adverse effect on our operating performance because some of these competing properties may be newer  better located or better capitalized than our properties 
properties with environmental problems could cause us to incur clean up costs or other liabilities 
various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations impose liability upon a current or previous owner or operator of real property for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances or other wastes at the property 
these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances or other waste 
in addition  the presence of property contamination  or the failure to remediate contamination at a property properly  may adversely affect a party s ability to borrow using the real property as collateral 
persons who generate or arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or other wastes may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination at a disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is or ever was owned or operated by them 
environmental laws and common law principles also impose liability upon a party for the release of and exposure to environmental contamination  including asbestos containing materials into the air  and third parties may use these laws to seek recovery from owners or operators of property for personal injury or property damage associated with environmental contamination  including asbestos containing materials 
as the owner of the properties  we may be liable for these types of costs 
we obtain environmental site assessments on all of our properties prior to their acquisition 
the purpose of environmental site assessments is to identify potential recognized environmental conditions that may be associated with a property 
for a number of our properties  the environmental site assessments also referenced prior phase ii environmental site assessments which involved subsurface sampling and analysis on such properties 
the previously mentioned environmental site assessments have not revealed any potential recognized environmental conditions that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business  assets or results of operations 
however  it is possible that the previously mentioned environmental site assessments relating to any one of our properties do not reveal all adverse environmental conditions 
in addition  there could be environmental conditions that were created at a property after the applicable environmental site assessment was completed 

table of contents effective january   we renewed our insurance which covers environmental conditions and business interruption if and when they occur 
this policy covers both governmental and third party claims associated with the covered environmental conditions 
our limits for loss under the policy are million per occurrence and million in the aggregate 
we cannot assure you that these coverages will be sufficient to cover all costs of environmental issues that could arise 
americans with disabilities act compliance could lead to unanticipated costs 
the americans with disabilities act of requires specified public accommodations to meet federal requirements governing accessibility for persons with disabilities related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act could require modifications to our properties 
non compliance could result in  among other things  various penalties including injunctive relief and monetary damages 
although we have no basis for believing that our properties are not in compliance with the requirements of the americans with disabilities act  if we were required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the americans with disabilities act  our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions to our shareholders may be adversely affected 
some of our properties may be subject to uninsured losses such as from earthquakes or acts of terrorism 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  flood and  where appropriate  extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties  with policy specifications  exclusions  deductibles and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties 
there are  however  certain types of losses  such as from wars  that may be either uninsurable or the cost of obtaining insurance would be so high that it would be more prudent to accept the risk of loss 
we currently maintain a million blanket earthquake policy on the properties we own in northern and southern california and a million blanket terrorism policy on all our properties 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose both capital invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property 
any such loss would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if another terrorist incident occurs  however  insurance policies purchased by us may expressly exclude hostile acts  and it may be impossible to obtain insurance covering terrorist attacks 
we may not be able to purchase policies in the future with coverage limits and deductibles similar to those that are currently in place 
in addition  we would expect our insurance premiums to increase in the future  which may have an adverse impact on our cash flow 
property ownership through partnerships and joint ventures could subject us to the contrary business objectives of our partners or co venturers 
through prentiss properties acquisition partners  lp  our operating partnership  we own non controlling interests in real estate  including a non controlling interest in the broadmoor austin associates and a non controlling interest in tysons international partners  which in the aggregate represented approximately million  or of our net income for the year ended december  our pro rata share of mortgage debt related to these unconsolidated interests is approximately million  or of our total mortgage debt outstanding  as of december  through these interests  we act as managing venture partner and have the authority to conduct business affairs of each joint venture  subject to approval and veto rights of the other venture partner 
we may also participate with other entities in property ownership or in providing property related services through joint ventures or partnerships 
partnership or joint venture investments may involve risks such as the following our partners or co venturers might become bankrupt  
table of contents our partners or co venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  and our partners or co venturers may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or make requests contrary to our policies or objectives 
we will  however  seek to maintain sufficient control of such partnerships or joint ventures to achieve our business objectives 
although our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships or joint ventures  our revolving credit facility requires lender consent for certain investments in land  development projects and joint ventures 
in the future  we may acquire limited partnership interests in property partnerships without partnership management responsibility or co venturer interests or co general partnership interests in property partnerships with shared responsibility for managing the affairs of the property partnership or joint venture 
in these instances  we will not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding the property partnership or joint venture 
our properties are illiquid assets 
our investments in properties are relatively illiquid 
this illiquidity will tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
some of our properties are mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness 
if we were unable to meet our mortgage payments  the lender could foreclose on the properties and we could incur a loss 
in addition  if we wished to dispose of one or more of the mortgaged properties  we might not be able to obtain a release of the lien on the mortgaged property 
if a lender forecloses on a mortgaged property or if a mortgage lien prevents us from selling a property  our cash flow available for distribution to our security holders could decline 
our incurrence of debt could have a material adverse effect on operating performance 
if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as the issuance of new equity capital  we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay distributions at expected levels and to repay all maturing debt 
furthermore  if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  the interest expense relating to such refinanced indebtedness would increase 
this increase would adversely affect our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions to our shareholders 
if a property is mortgaged to collateralize payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the property could be foreclosed upon by or otherwise transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value 
our use of variable rate debt and derivative financial instruments may cause an increase in debt service 
we have incurred and may incur in the future indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates 
variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase  which would adversely affect our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions to our shareholders 
as of december   we had million of floating rate debt out of total debt  including our pro rata share of joint venture debt  of billion 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements in the ordinary course of our business to hedge or modify our exposures to interest rate fluctuations 
of the floating rate debt  million was swapped to fixed rate debt through various interest rate protection contracts with maturity dates ranging from august to march while our use of these derivatives is intended to allow us to better manage certain risks  it is possible that  over time  mis matches may arise with respect to the derivatives and the cash market instruments they are intended to hedge 
discrepancies can also arise between the derivative and cash markets 
derivatives also have risks that are similar in type to the risks of the cash market instrument on which their values are based 
for example  in times of market stress  sharp price movements or reductions in liquidity in the cash markets may be related to comparable or even greater price movements and reductions in liquidity in the derivative markets 
further  the risks associated with derivatives are potentially greater than those associated with the related 
table of contents cash market instruments because of the additional complexity and potential for leverage 
in addition  derivatives may create credit risks  as well as legal  operational and other risks beyond those associated with the underlying cash market instruments on which their values are based 
credit risk involves the risk that a counterparty on a derivative transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations 
in an effort to limit credit risk  we have a policy that requires the counterparty to the transaction to have a credit rating no lower than a by a nationally recognized rating agency at the time we enter into a derivative transaction 
there can be no assurance  however  that our hedging strategy or techniques and policies for minimizing credit and other risks associated with our hedging activity will be effective  that our profitability will not be adversely affected during any period of changes in interest rates or that the costs of hedging will not exceed the benefits 
if we are unable to replace construction loans with permanent refinancing  we may have to sell the development properties at a loss 
if new developments are financed through construction loans or if acquisitions are financed with short term bridge loans in anticipation of later  permanent financing  there is a risk that upon completion of construction or the maturity of the bridge loans  permanent financing may not be available or may be available only on disadvantageous terms 
as of december   we were not a party to any construction loan commitments 
in the event that we enter into such financing arrangements and upon maturity are unable to obtain permanent financing for these properties on favorable terms  we could be forced to sell such properties at a loss or the properties could be foreclosed upon by the lender and result in loss of income and asset value 
we depend on our direct and indirect subsidiaries dividends and distributions  and these subsidiaries creditors and preferred security holders are entitled to payment of amounts payable to them by the subsidiaries before the subsidiaries may pay any dividends or distributions to us 
substantially all of our assets consist of our partnership interests in prentiss properties acquisition partners  lp  our operating partnership 
our operating partnership holds substantially all of its properties and assets through subsidiaries 
our operating partnership  therefore  depends for substantially all of its revenue on cash distributions to it by its subsidiaries 
the creditors of each subsidiary are entitled to payment of the subsidiary s obligations to them  when due and payable  before distributions may be made by the subsidiary to our operating partnership 
thus  our operating partnership s ability to make distributions to its unit holders depends on its subsidiaries ability to satisfy their obligations to their creditors and make distributions to our operating partnership 
in addition  the right of our operating partnership unit holders to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of our operating partnership s direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation  reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary  and any consequent right of our operating partnership unit holders to participate in those assets  will be subject to the claims of the creditors and preferred security holders  if any  of the subsidiary 
furthermore  the holders of preferred units of our operating partnership are entitled to receive preferred distributions before payment of distributions to holders of operating partnership common units  including us 
thus  our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common shares depends on our operating partnership s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to holders of preferred units and then to make distributions to us 
at december   we had two outstanding series of preferred units of our operating partnership which were not held by us 
these preferred units  the series b preferred units and series e preferred units  have preference over our common shares 
the series b preferred units have a total liquidation value of approximately million  and the series e preferred units have a total liquidation value of approximately million 
in addition  our shareholders will have the right to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon the liquidation  reorganization or insolvency of the subsidiary  and consequently to participate in those assets  only after the claims of the creditors  including trade creditors  and preferred security holders  if any  of the subsidiary are satisfied 
risks related to our company our shareholders ability to effect a change of control may be limited 
we have a shareholder rights plan 
in february  we adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one purchase right for each common share of beneficial interest 
the purchase rights may have the effect of delaying  inhibiting or 
table of contents preventing a transaction or a change in control of us that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders 
the purchase rights can cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires or more of our outstanding common shares unless the purchase rights have been redeemed by our board of trustees 
however  because the purchase rights are redeemable by our board of trustees  the purchase rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by our board of trustees 
we have an ownership limitation 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended  no more than in value of our outstanding shares of beneficial interest may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals during the last half of our taxable year  other than our taxable year 
to ensure that we will not fail to qualify as a reit  our declaration of trust authorizes our board of trustees to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit 
in addition  our declaration of trust has an ownership limitation which provides that no person may own  directly or indirectly  more than of the number of outstanding common shares  other than michael v 
prentiss  who currently may own up to of the number of outstanding common shares  or more than of the number of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest of any series 
the board of trustees  upon receipt of a ruling from the irs  an opinion of counsel or other evidence satisfactory to our board of trustees  may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limitation 
for example  our board of trustees has exempted security capital preferred growth incorporated from the ownership limitation on the condition that security capital preferred growth incorporated not own more than of the number of outstanding common shares 
the board of trustees may not grant an exemption from the ownership limitation to any proposed transferee if such exemption would result in the termination of our status as a reit 
the ownership limitation may have the effect of delaying  inhibiting or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders 
we have a staggered board 
our board of trustees is divided into three classes  each with a three year term  thus  only a portion of our board of trustees stand for election at each annual meeting 
the staggered terms of trustees may reduce the possibility of a tender offer or an attempt to change control of us  even though a tender offer or change in control might be in the best interest of our shareholders 
the board of trustees can issue additional shares 
our declaration of trust authorizes our board of trustees to amend our declaration of trust  without shareholder approval  to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of beneficial interest or the number of shares of beneficial interest of any class that we have the authority to issue  issue additional authorized but unissued preferred or common shares  and classify or reclassify any unissued common shares or preferred shares and to set the preferences  rights and other terms of such classified or unclassified shares 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders 
our status as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements 
we have operated and intend to continue to operate as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we have not requested  and do not expect to request  a ruling from the irs that the operating partnership and each of its non corporate subsidiaries have been and will be classified as partnerships for federal income tax purposes or that we qualify as a reit 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex 
table of contents provisions of the internal revenue code  with limited judicial and administrative guidance available  to facts and circumstances that may be subject to differing interpretations for federal income tax purposes 
while we have operated and intend to continue to operate as a reit for federal income tax purposes  if the irs were to successfully challenge the tax status of the operating partnership or a non corporate subsidiary as a partnership  or if we fail to qualify as a reit for any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
unless entitled to relief under the internal revenue code  we also would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the disqualification year 
as a result  cash available for distribution would be reduced for each of the years involved 
although we intend to continue to operate as a reit  future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause our board of trustees  with the consent of our shareholders holding at least a majority of all the outstanding common shares  to revoke the reit election 
we have minimum distribution requirements that could require us to incur additional debt 
to qualify as a reit prior to  we were required to distribute at least of our net taxable income to our shareholders  excluding any net capital gain 
as a result of the reit modernization act  the distribution requirement was reduced to for and future years 
in addition  to avoid a non deductible excise tax  we must also distribute annually at least the sum of the following of our ordinary income for that year  of our capital gain net income for that year  and of our undistributed taxable income from prior years 
we have exceeded the distribution requirements in every year and we expect to comply with the distribution requirements 
if unfavorable market conditions exist  we may have to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the reit distribution requirements 
if such unfavorable conditions occurred  we might not be able to fund all future capital needs with income from operations  and might have to rely on third party sources of capital  which may or may not be available on favorable terms 
changes in tax laws could affect our reit status 
at any time  future legislation or administrative or judicial decisions or actions could affect our tax treatment or qualification as a reit including tax liability  possibly with retroactive effect 
while we do not anticipate any such decisions or actions  the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department 
we cannot predict whether  when  in what forms  or with what effective dates  the tax laws applicable to us or an investment in us might be changed 
conflicts of interests in our business could result in decisions not in your best interest 
prentiss principals could have differing objectives from other shareholders upon the sale  refinancing or prepayment of indebtedness of properties 
messrs 
prentiss and august  our senior executive officers  and their affiliates may have unrealized taxable gain associated with their units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership 
messrs 
prentiss and august may suffer different and more adverse tax consequences than our other shareholders upon the sale or refinancing of properties that were contributed to the operating partnership by messrs 
prentiss and august 
therefore  messrs 
prentiss and august and our other shareholders may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any sale or refinancing of properties 
while we  through prentiss properties i  inc  the general partner of the operating partnership  have the exclusive authority as to whether and on what terms to sell or refinance an individual property  messrs 
prentiss and august may influence us not to sell  or refinance or prepay 
table of contents the indebtedness associated with properties even though such a transaction might otherwise be to our financial advantage  or may influence us to refinance properties with a high level of debt 
our policies with respect to conflicts of interests may not eliminate the influence of conflicts 
we have adopted policies intended to minimize conflicts of interest 
for example  our bylaws provide that all transactions in which executive officers or trustees have a conflicting interest with us may be subject to approval by a majority of our trustees that are not affiliated with any of our affiliates or by the holders of a majority of the common shares held by disinterested shareholders 
we have implemented a code of business conduct governing the conduct of all employees which further reduces the potential for conflicts of interest 
there can be no assurance that our policies will be successful in eliminating the influence of conflicts 
decisions could be made that might fail to reflect fully the interests of all our shareholders 
our declaration of trust includes a provision permitting each individual trustee to engage in the type of business activities conducted by us without first presenting any investment opportunities to us  even though such investment opportunities may be within the scope of our investment policies 
our board of trustees may change policies and incur debt without shareholder approval 
our board of trustees determines our investment  financing  borrowing and distribution policies  and our policies with respect to all other activities  including growth  capitalization and operations 
our board of trustees has adopted a policy limiting our total combined indebtedness plus our pro rata share of joint venture debt to or less of our total market capitalization  but our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness we may incur 
although our board of trustees has no present intention to do so  these policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of our board of trustees  limited only by various restrictions in our credit agreements  without a vote of our shareholders 
our credit agreements limit total indebtedness to of total assets and require a debt service coverage ratio of at least to a change in our investment  financing  borrowing and distribution policies could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or the market price of our common shares 
we are dependent on the services of michael v 
prentiss and thomas f 
august 
we are dependent on the efforts of our chairman and chief executive officer  messrs 
prentiss and august 
the loss of their services could have an adverse effect on our operations 
each of messrs 
prentiss and august has entered into an employment agreement which will expire in february and may  respectively 
messrs 
prentiss and august have agreed in their employment agreements that for a period of two years after they are no longer employed by us they will not enter into employment with any company which is in a business that is competitive to our business 
if this provision  or if similar provisions in other employment agreements with our other employees  is determined to not be binding on messrs 
prentiss or august  or any other employee  those persons would be able to enter into employment with companies which compete with us immediately after those persons ceased to be employed by us 
our third party property management  leasing  development and construction business and related services involve relationships which may be subject to early termination or a lack of control 
through our operating partnership and prentiss properties resources  the manager  we engage in the business of management  leasing  development and construction of properties owned by third parties 
risks associated with these activities include the following related contracts  which are typically cancelable upon days notice or upon specific events  including sale of the property  may be terminated by the property owner or may be lost in connection with a sale of such property  contracts may not be renewed upon expiration or may not be renewed on terms consistent with current terms  and 
table of contents rental revenues upon which management  leasing and development fees are based may decline as a result of general real estate market conditions or specific market factors affecting properties that we manage  lease or develop  resulting in decreased management  leasing or development fee income 
at december   the capital stock of the manager was divided into two classes voting common stock  all of which was owned by mr 
prentiss  and non voting common stock  all of which we held through the operating partnership 
the voting common stock represented of the ownership interests in the manager and the non voting common stock represented of the ownership interests in the manager 
mr 
prentiss  as the holder of all of the manager s voting common stock  had the ability to elect the directors of the manager 
we were not able to elect directors and  therefore  were not able to influence the day to day management decisions of the manager 
effective january   our operating partnership acquired all of the voting interest of prentiss properties resources from mr 
prentiss 
as a result  our operating partnership has sole control of the decision making processes of prentiss properties resources 
we have shares available for future sale that could adversely affect the price of our common shares 
under our declaration of trust  our board of trustees has the authority to do the following amend our declaration of trust  without shareholder approval  to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of beneficial interest or the number of shares of beneficial interest of any class  including common shares  that we have the authority to issue  and issue additional authorized but unissued common shares or preferred shares 
as of december   we have authorized  common shares  of which  common shares are unissued 
in addition  we have granted options to purchase  common shares to executives officers  employees and trustees  of which options to purchase  common shares remain outstanding 
we have reserved a total of  common shares and  common shares for issuance upon conversion of the series d preferred shares and common units  respectively 
sales or issuances of a substantial number of common shares  or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect prevailing market prices of the common shares and dilute the percentage ownership held by our shareholders 
limited partners of our operating partnership have the right to receive  in our or the general partner s discretion  either cash or one common share  in exchange for each limited partnership unit they now hold  if and to the extent they tender such units for redemption 
as of december   there were  common units of our operating partnership outstanding and held by partners other than prentiss properties trust  and  if we or the general partner elect to redeem such units for common shares  these common units are exchangeable for  common shares 
we are party to registration rights agreements under which we are required to register the issuance of common shares which we may issue upon the redemption by the holders of units of limited partnership interest in our operating partnership 
we can make no prediction concerning the effect that such issuance or future sales of any such common shares will have on market prices 
changes in market conditions could hurt the market price of our shares 
the value of our common shares depends on various market conditions  which may change from time to time 
among the market conditions that may affect the value of our common shares are the extent of institutional investor interest in us  the reputation of reits generally and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities  including securities issued by other real estate companies  and fixed income securities  our financial condition and performance  and general financial market conditions 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 

table of contents increased market rates may hurt the value of our shares 
we believe that investors consider the distribution rate on reit shares  expressed as a percentage of the price of the shares  relative to market interest rates as an important factor in deciding whether to buy or sell the shares 
if market interest rates go up  prospective purchasers of reit shares may expect a higher distribution rate 
higher interest rates would not  however  result in more funds for us to distribute and in fact  would likely increase our borrowing costs and might decrease our funds available for distribution 
thus  higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our common shares to decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates as a result of our revolving credit facility and long term debt 
at december   we had outstanding total indebtedness  including our pro rata share of joint venture debt  of approximately billion  or approximately of total market capitalization based on a common share price of per common share 
our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for our borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangement 
in addition  we may enter into derivative financial instruments such as options  forwards  interest rate swaps  caps and floors to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
approximately of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of at december  of the remaining million  or  representing our variable rate debt  million was effectively locked at an interest rate before the spread over libor  of through our interest rate swap agreements 
we regularly review interest rate exposure on our outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations outstanding at december   the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates for the debt outstanding during the periods 
the debt outstanding as presented in the table includes our pro rata share of joint venture debt 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts that expire and weighted average interest rates for in place swaps during the period 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on day libor as of december  the fair value of our fixed rate debt indicates the estimated principal amount of debt having similar debt service requirements  which could have been borrowed by us at december  the rate assumed in the fair value calculation of fixed rate debt is equal to  representing our estimated borrowing rate for fixed rate debt instruments similar in term to those outstanding at december  the fair value of our variable to fixed interest rate swaps indicates the estimated amount that would have been paid by us had they been terminated at december  expected maturity date total fair value thereafter in thousands liabilities long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps variable to fixed avg

table of contents the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  and does not consider exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
in addition  because firm commitments are not represented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during future periods  prevailing interest rates  and our hedging strategies at that time 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our financing requirements
