business overview we are a leading global manufacturer  marketer and distributor of a broad range of cutting tools  tooling systems  supplies and technical services  as well as wear resistant parts 
we believe that our reputation for manufacturing excellence and technological expertise and innovation in our principal products has helped us achieve a leading market presence in our primary markets 
we believe we are the second largest global provider of metalcutting tools and tooling systems 
end users of our products include metalworking manufacturers and suppliers in the aerospace  automotive  machine tool and farm machinery industries  as well as manufacturers and suppliers in the highway construction  coal mining  quarrying and oil and gas exploration industries 
sales sales of  million in increased percent  versus  million last year 
the increase in sales is attributed to the positive benefit of million from the widia acquisition and the favorable foreign currency effects of million 
additionally  metalworking south america  a component of mssg  showed continued growth with a million increase in revenue 
for industrial products group ipg  which is a component of mssg  revenue increased million due to market share gains made in the high speed steel business 
this was offset by the sale of strong tool which comprised million of revenue 
after taking these factors into consideration  the significant components of the remaining change was attributed to a decline in sales in metalworking north america  which is a component of mssg  of million  metalworking europe  which is a component of mssg  of million  energy  which is a component of amsg  of million  j l of million and fss of million 
the decline in sales in north america and europe is due to overall weak market conditions that were experienced throughout the decline in fss sales is due to the loss of sales associated with the discontinuance of certain customer relationships 
sales of  million in decreased percent compared to sales of  million in the decline in sales is attributed to unfavorable foreign currency effects of million and million related to the decrease in revenue year over year due to the sale of strong tool 
lower sales in north america  due to overall weak market conditions  contributed to the remaining decline in sales 
gross profit margin in our gross profit margin remained flat at percent 
the gross margin was negatively impacted by lower widia margins which decreased margins by million  a decrease in domestic pension income of million  unfavorable product mix and pricing pressures 
this was offset by a positive benefit from foreign exchange of million  favorable raw material prices and lean manufacturing efficiencies 
the gross margin includes charges associated with the widia integration of million 
the gross margin includes inventory abandonment charges of million associated with facility closures in the gross profit margin for was percent  down from percent in the decrease was due primarily to underutilized capacity and unfavorable manufacturing variances associated with the lower sales volume 
additionally  unfavorable product mix contributed to the lower margins 
these unfavorable items were partially offset by efficiencies derived from our lean initiatives 
gross margins for and included million and million  respectively  of inventory abandonment charges primarily associated with facility closures in and the rationalization of certain product lines discontinued as part of a program to streamline and optimize the product offering of j l in operating expense operating expense of million in was million or percent higher than the operating expense level in of million 
the increase in operating expenses is associated with the widia acquisition  million of unfavorable foreign currency effects  a decrease in domestic pension income of million and reinstatement of salary increases and the company match on k contributions 
these amounts were offset  in part  by the strong tool divestiture which comprised million of the operating expense 
operating expenses included charges of million in related to the widia integration 
in  operating expense declined to million from million in ongoing cost cutting and lean initiatives  combined with several short term savings actions  including the curtailment of salary increases and the company match on k contributions  mitigated the impact of reduced sales 
although overall operating expense declined  our spending on growth programs and research and development was sustained 
restructuring and asset impairment charges impairment in june  we completed an assessment of the carrying value of certain long lived assets in the electronics business  a component of amsg 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded a pre tax charge of million million after tax as a component of restructuring and asset impairment charges 
the charge is a result of price declines caused by persistent global over capacity and low cost asian competition 
the fixed asset impairment charge reduced the book value of the electronics business assets to million 
this remaining value was determined based on cash flow and estimated realizable value of the assets 
facility consolidation program in june  we approved a facility consolidation program 
this program is expected to have restructuring charges of approximately million and is anticipated to generate in excess of million in cash savings annually 
the plan includes the closure of two regional operating centers and the framingham manufacturing facility and a workforce reduction 
in conjunction with the program  we recorded an asset write down related to fixed assets that will be disposed of as a result of the restructuring program 
all actions pertain to the mssg segment 
all costs associated with the restructuring program are expected to be incurred and paid by december   except certain lease costs which may extend to june accrual at asset cash accrual at in thousands june  expense write down expenditures june  employee severance   facility rationalization total   workforce restructuring program in october  we announced a global salaried workforce reduction of approximately five percent 
the reduction as announced was expected to cost between million and million 
the expected cost was revised to million as the plan was substantially completed as of june  as previously announced  the plan generated in excess of million in cash savings during fiscal the program resulted in million of charges for the mssg segment  million for amsg  million for j l  million for fss and million for corporate 
the components of the restructuring accrual at june  for this program are as follows accrual at expense cash accrual at in thousands june  expense adjustment expenditures june  employee severance    total    the restructuring accrual at june  represents expected future cash payments for these obligations over the next six months 
the expense adjustments represent revisions in the original cost estimates related to this plan 
widia integration in addition to the workforce restructuring program  we have implemented two widia acquisition related integration programs kennametal integration restructuring program and the widia integration plan which together are expected to result in a global headcount reduction of between and positions 
the integration plan is expected to result in annual cost savings of million annually 
we have substantially completed the integration plan and  as of june  have closed six sales offices  two manufacturing facilities and closed or consolidated four warehouses 
as of june  we have terminated approximately employees in europe and india and expect the remaining workforce reduction to be within our original estimates 
we expect the completion of all integration activities in the second quarter of kennametal integration restructuring program this program includes employee severance costs associated with existing kennametal facilities 
the components of the restructuring accrual at june  for this program are as follows accrual at cash accrual at in thousands june  expense expenditures june  employee severance    total    widia integration plan in connection with the acquisition  we have established a widia integration plan to develop centers of excellence in functional areas and enable long term growth and competitive advantages 
costs that are incurred under this plan will be accounted for under eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
as a result  these costs have been recorded as part of the widia purchase price allocation 
accrual at adjustment cash accrual at in thousands june  to goodwill expenditures june  facility rationalizations    employee severance    terminated contracts  total    widia restructuring in connection with our acquisition of widia  we assumed million of restructuring accruals related to restructuring programs initiated by widia prior to the acquisition date 
these programs  initiated in december  relate to the severance of european employees in both production and administration 
the accrual balance at june  of million represents a decrease of million related to cash payments made during the period since acquisition 
amsg and mssg restructuring in november  we announced a restructuring program whereby we recognized special charges of million 
this was done in response to continued steep declines in the end market demand in the electronics and industrial products group businesses 
all initiatives under this program have been implemented and completed 
these costs are related to the closing and consolidation of the amsg electronics facility in chicago  ill  and mssg industrial products group s pine bluff  ark 
and monticello  ind 
locations  the production of a particular line of products in rogers  ark 
and several customer service centers 
as a result  we recorded restructuring charges of million during related to exit costs associated with these actions  including severance for substantially all employees at the closed facilities 
we also recorded a charge of million related to severance for individuals  primarily in the mssg segment 
the components of the charges and the accrual at june  for this program are as follows accrual at expense cash accrual at in thousands june  expense adjustment expenditures june  facility rationalizations   employee severance   total   the restructuring accrual at june  represents future cash payments for these obligations  of which the majority are expected to occur over the next six months

in the fss segment for  we recorded restructuring charges of million for severance related to individuals 
total charges related to this plan were million which are consistent with our original estimate of to million 
during the third quarter of  we completed the j l and fss business improvement programs and have incurred cash payments of million  million and million related to this program in  and  respectively 
core business resize program in  we took actions to reduce our salaried workforce in response to the weakened us manufacturing sector 
as a result of implementing this core business resize program  we recorded a restructuring charge in of million related to severance for individuals 
all employee benefit initiatives under this program have been implemented and the program has been completed 
cash expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
amortization of intangibles the provision for amortization expense was million in compared with million in the increase in amortization expense of million or percent  is attributed to the widia acquisition  which was completed on august  as a result of the acquisition  we have recorded million of identifiable intangible assets of which million has a definite life and therefore will be amortized over its remaining useful life 
the provision for amortization expense was million in compared with million in the decrease was primarily the result of ceasing amortization of goodwill in under the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which was adopted on july  interest expense interest expense was million in compared with million in this increase in interest expense is due to the greater average level of borrowings to fund the widia acquisition 
total debt and capital leases has increased from million in to million in our average domestic borrowing rate was percent in compared to percent in the increase in average borrowing rate is a result of the issuance of senior unsecured notes and the related interest rate swaps 
interest expense for and included million and million  respectively  related to the write down of the remaining deferred financing fees 
the write down of financing fees in was a result of our decision to reduce the size of our credit agreement from million to million 
the write down in related to deferred financing fees from the bank credit agreement entered into in bank credit agreement that was replaced in june with the credit agreement 
interest expense for was million compared with million in the decrease was due to debt reduction and lower average borrowing rates 
overall debt levels declined to million at june  from million in our average domestic borrowing rate of percent in was basis points below due to federal reserve rate cuts and improved pricing under the bank credit agreement 
other income expense  net in  other income  net increased by million to million compared with million in the prior year income of million includes the negative impact of the loss on divestiture of strong tool of million 
included in other income  net for were million in fees associated with the account receivable securitization program  which decreased million from the million recorded in the decline in account receivable securitization fees is attributable to lower interest rates in the commercial paper market 
additionally  interest income has increased from million in to million in the benefits associated with the securitization program and increased interest income were offset by foreign exchange losses  which increased million during the current year from income of million in to expense of million in in  other income  net increased by million to million  compared to other expense  net of million in these amounts include losses of million associated with our divestiture of strong tool company and million associated with our divestiture of ats industrial supply  inc ats in and  respectively 
account receivable securitization fees were reduced by million during due to a significant decline in commercial paper rates which are the basis for determining the fees 
additionally  during foreign exchange gains increased by million resulting from contracts entered to hedge against cross border cash flows 
income taxes the effective tax rate for was percent compared to an effective rate of percent for the effective rate included an percentage point negative impact related to the impairment charge for our electronics business unit 
partially offsetting this was a percentage point favorable impact related to the utilization of capital losses that were previously reserved 
also included in our effective rate is the net impact of our european tax planning initiatives offset by losses from our foreign subsidiaries for which no tax benefit has been provided 
the effective tax rate in was percent compared to the effective rate of percent in the significant decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the effects of the elimination of non deductible goodwill expense due to the adoption of sfas  as well as european tax planning 
changes in accounting principles we adopted sfas no 
 effective july   which established new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets  including new measurement techniques for evaluating the recoverability of such assets 
under sfas no 
 all goodwill amortization ceased effective july  material amounts of recorded goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units in were tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
as a result of the adoption of this rule  we recorded a non cash charge in  net of tax  of million  specific to the electronics amsg segment million and the ipg mssg segment million businesses  which were acquired in as part of the acquisition of greenfield industries 
the fair values of these reporting units were determined using a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
under sfas no 
 the impairment adjustment recognized at adoption of this standard was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  effective july  net income we reported net income of million for compared with net loss of million in net income in the current year included a million after tax charge associated with the electronics impairment 
the net loss reported in was due largely to the goodwill impairment charges  which was million 
the increase in net income  in the current year  is due to a reduction in impairment charges from million in to million in  offset by an increase in operating expense related to the widia integration  a million increase in interest expense and a percentage point increase in the effective tax rate 
due largely to the goodwill impairment charge  we recorded a net loss in of million  compared to net income of million in additionally  in earnings declined due to lower sales levels and margins  partially offset by lower operating and interest expense  and a decline in our effective tax rate 
outside of the goodwill impairment charge  other restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in related primarily to the mssg and amsg restructuring initiated in and additional costs associated with restructuring actions made in the j l business improvement program that was started in included in net income for was million of goodwill amortization  net of tax that was not included in due to the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
business segment review our operations are organized into four global business units consisting of mssg  amsg  j l and fss  and corporate functional shared services 
the presentation of segment information reflects the manner in which we organize segments for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
metalworking solutions services group in the mssg segment  we provide consumable metalcutting tools and tooling systems to manufacturing companies in a wide range of industries throughout the world 
metalcutting operations include turning  boring  threading  grooving  milling and drilling 
our tooling systems consist of a steel toolholder and a cutting tool such as an indexable insert or drill made from cemented tungsten carbides  high speed steel or other hard materials 
other cutting tools include end mills  reamers and taps 
we provide solutions to our customers metalcutting needs through engineering services aimed at improving their competitiveness 
we also manufacture cutting tools  drill bits  saw blades and other tools for the consumer market which are marketed under private label and other proprietary brands 
in thousands external sales    intersegment sales    operating income    mssg external sales increased by million  or percent  from the increase in mssg external sales is primarily related to the acquisition of widia which increased sales by million and favorable foreign exchange effects of million 
the other significant components that affected the mssg segment included north america  which had a decrease in external sales of million  europe  which had a million decrease offset by a million increase in south america and the industrial products group which had a million increase in sales 
operating income declined from million in to million in  representing a decrease of million or percent 
the decrease in operating income is directly related to the dilutive effect of the widia margins which decreased margins by million and unfavorable product mix and pricing pressures 
we continue to expect widia to be accretive to mssg margins during as the synergy benefits from our widia integration program are realized 
included in operating income is million and million of restructuring costs for and  respectively 
the restructuring expense pertains to the workforce restructuring program and facility consolidation program 
the restructuring expense has declined due to the completion of the amsg and mssg restructuring program 
this reduction was offset  in part  by million of widia integration costs 
in  external sales in the mssg segment of million declined percent from million in in the north america metalworking group  sales declined million or percent while industrial products group sales declined million or percent 
due to depressed market conditions  sales of the north american operations contributed to nearly of the overall segment decline 
additionally  unfavorable foreign exchange effects accounted for million of the decrease in sales 
in  operating income declined million to million  including million of charges related to mssg restructuring 
additionally  the lower sales levels contributed significantly to the reduced operating profit  partially offset by operating expense reductions and lean initiatives 
advanced materials solutions group this segment s principal business is the production and sale of cemented tungsten carbide products used in mining  highway construction and engineered applications including circuit board drills  compacts and other similar applications 
these products have technical commonality to our core metalworking products 
we also sell metallurgical powders to manufacturers of cemented tungsten carbide products 
in addition  we provide application specific component design services and on site application support services 
in thousands external sales    intersegment sales    operating income    amsg external sales for increased by million  or percent  from million in to million in the increase in external sales is attributed to favorable foreign exchange effects of million  an increase in engineered products group which increased million  and the carmet acquisition which contributed million to sales 
this was offset  in part  by a million decline in energy products 
operating income decreased from million in to million to restructuring expense in was million compared to the prior year of million 
additionally  operating income includes integration costs associated with the widia acquisition of million  and the electronics impairment charge of million pre tax 
operating income benefited from manufacturing efficiencies  reduced restructuring costs  lower raw material costs and benefits derived from previously implemented restructuring programs 
amsg external sales declined million or percent from million in to million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects accounted for million of the decline 
a continued weak demand in the electronics business due to a depressed market accounted for percent of the overall sales decline of this segment 
additionally  lower sales in energy and the engineered products group contributed and percent  respectively  to the overall sales decline due primarily to declining rig counts and lower levels of industrial activity 
operating income declined by million from million in to million in a portion of the decrease is attributed to restructuring charges which increased from million in to million in the remainder of the decline was due to lower gross profit due to under utilization of capacity caused by the volume declines which was partially offset by operating expense reductions 
j l industrial supply in this segment  we provide metalworking consumables and related products to small and medium sized manufacturers in the united states and the united kingdom 
j l markets products and services through annual mail order catalogs and monthly sales flyers  telemarketing  the internet and field sales 
j l distributes a broad range of metalcutting tools  abrasives  drills  machine tool accessories  precision measuring tools  gages  hand tools and other supplies used in metalcutting operations 
in thousands external sales    intersegment sales    operating income loss   external sales in this segment have decreased by million  or percent  from million in to million in the decrease in sales is due to the sale of strong tool company which comprised million in sales in and due to slower sales in automotive and aerospace markets offset  in part  by favorable foreign exchange of million 
operating income increased by million from a loss of million in to income of million in the increase is due to restructuring expense declining from million in to million in in  external sales in this segment declined million or percent from  including eight percent due to the ats and strong tool company divestitures 
the remainder of the decline is due to weak demand in the broad us industrial market 
the decline occurred primarily due to the reduction in sales despite reduced operating expense as a result of the initiatives related to the business improvement plan implemented in both and operating income in and included million and million  respectively  associated with the business improvement program begun in additionally  included million related to the tender offer to acquire the minority shares of jlk 
full service supply in the fss segment  we provide metalworking consumables and related products to large and medium sized manufacturers in the united states and canada 
fss offers integrated supply programs that provide inventory management systems  just in time availability and programs that focus on total cost savings 
in thousands external sales    intersegment sales    operating income   fss external sales for declined by million  or percent  from million in to million in the decline in sales is due to the discontinuance of certain customer relationships 
fss had an operating loss for which is a million decline from the operating loss is due to the inability of the reduced volume to cover fixed costs 
we are addressing this issue through right sizing efforts and through a continuous program to reduce operating expenses 
new business and marketing programs have been developed to offset the lost sales 
at the end of and during the first quarter of  we have obtained new customers that have an annualized sales value in excess of the revenue associated with the customers lost during the current year 
fss external sales for declined four percent  or million  compared to due primarily to the weakening in the north american industrial market 
operating income of million in  declined million compared to the decline is due to lower sales levels coupled with slightly lower gross margins due to a higher percentage of sales in the automotive sector 
liquidity and capital resources our cash flow from operations is the primary source of financing for capital expenditures and internal growth 
the most significant risks associated with our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations is the overall level of demand for our products 
however  we believe we can adequately control costs and manage our working capital to meet our cash flow needs  despite changes in the economic cycle 
in june  we entered into a three year  multi currency  million revolving bank credit facility with a group of financial institutions credit agreement 
following a review of anticipated borrowing requirements  in june  we notified the administrative agent of our decision to permanently reduce the credit agreement from million to million resulting in lower facility fees for the remaining two years of the agreement 
this resulted in a write down of a portion of deferred financing fees of million 
the credit agreement replaced the previous bank credit agreement  euro credit agreement and the yen credit facility 
the credit agreement allows for borrowings in us dollars  euro  canadian dollars  pound sterling or japanese yen 
the credit agreement contains various covenants with which we must be in compliance  including three financial covenants a maximum leverage ratio  a maximum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth 
as of june  and  outstanding borrowings under this agreement were and million  respectively 
as of june   million of the borrowings were denominated in us dollars  million were denominated in euro and million were denominated in yen 
we had the ability to borrow under this agreement or otherwise have additional debt of up to and million as of june  and  respectively  and be in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant 
the million of available debt at the end of june  did not reflect the million of net borrowings incurred to fund the widia acquisition 
the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant requires that we maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a specified consolidated leverage ratio as that term is defined in this agreement 
at june  and  we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
additionally  we generally obtain local financing through credit lines with commercial banks in the various countries in which we operate 
at june   these borrowings amounted to million for notes payable and million for term debt and capital leases 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the availability under our credit lines will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements over the next months 
based upon our debt structure at june  and  and percent  respectively  of our debt was exposed to floating rates of interest  which is consistent with our target range for floating versus fixed interest rate debt 
we periodically review the target range and the strategies designed to maintain the mix of floating to fixed interest rate debt within that range 
in the future  we may decide to adjust the target range or the strategies to achieve it 
following is a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of june  in thousands and contractual obligations thereafter total cash commitments long term debt    notes payable   capital leases      operating leases      total      amount of committed expiration per period total amount less than over other commercial commitments committed year years years years standby letters of credit    guarantees   total commercial commitments    the standby letters of credit are related to insurance and other activities 
during  we generated million in cash from operations  compared to million in the million was driven by operating performance including million  derived from accounts receivable  million from inventory and million from tax refunds 
this was offset  in part  by a decrease in other accrued liabilities of million 
the increase in operating cash flow in is primarily related to cash generated from reductions in working capital 
net cash used for investing activities was million in  an increase of million compared to million used in the increase in cash used for investing activities is primarily due to the net cash paid for widia of million and purchase of subsidiary stock which increased million 
additionally  capital expenditures increased by million from million to million 
we believe the level of capital spending in was sufficient to enhance productivity and make necessary improvements to remain competitive 
net cash flow provided by financing activities was million in  compared to cash flow used of million in the increase of million is due primarily to the incremental borrowings required to finance the widia acquisition and million received from the termination of the fair value interest rate swaps 
this was partially offset by debt repayments  lower purchases of treasury stock and increased cash payments for dividends due to additional shares being issued in june during  we generated million in cash from operations  compared to million in lower income from operations and depreciation and amortization charges were partially offset by a net reduction in working capital 
the continued reduction of working capital reflects our initiatives to generate strong cash flow 
both receivables and inventories were reduced when compared to the prior year as a result of the above initiatives and the lower sales levels experienced in net cash used for investing activities was million in compared to the prior year  net cash used for investing activities declined by million primarily due to a reduction in the repurchase of minority interests of million from and decreased capital spending of million in net cash flow used for financing activities was million in  compared to million in this increase of million was due primarily to higher debt repayments including the repayment of the borrowings under the bank credit agreement and the euro credit agreement  partially offset by million in proceeds from the june stock offering 
on june   we issued million of senior unsecured notes due senior unsecured notes 
these notes were issued at of the face amount and yielded million of net proceeds after related financing costs 
additionally  on june   we issued million shares of our capital stock at a price of per share 
net of issuance costs  this offering yielded proceeds of million 
proceeds from these offerings were utilized to repay senior bank indebtedness 
during  we did not purchase any shares of our outstanding capital stock 
in  we continued our program to repurchase  from time to time  up to a total of  shares of our outstanding capital stock for investment or other general corporate purposes under the repurchase program announced on january  we completed the program announced in and the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of  additional shares of our outstanding capital stock 
during  we purchased  shares of our capital stock at a total cost of million bringing the total number of shares purchased under the authority of both programs to  shares 
the repurchases were financed principally by cash from operations and short term borrowings 
repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market  in negotiated or other permissible transactions 
in december  we entered into a eur million million at june  exchange rates euro denominated revolving credit facility euro credit agreement to partially hedge the foreign exchange exposure of our net investment in euro based subsidiaries and to diversify our interest rate exposure 
amounts borrowed under the euro credit agreement were required to be used to repay indebtedness under the bank credit agreement 
to the extent the bank credit agreement was fully repaid  these funds were available for working capital and general corporate purposes 
on january   we borrowed eur million under this facility to meet our obligation under the outstanding euro denominated forward exchange contracts 
the proceeds from the euro denominated forward exchange contracts of million were used to repay amounts borrowed under the bank credit agreement 
subsequently  the availability under the bank credit agreement was permanently reduced from million to million  resulting in a write down of a portion of deferred financing fees of million 
this was recorded as a component of interest expense 
the bank credit agreement and the euro credit agreement were cancelled in june when we repaid both facilities using proceeds raised from the public debt offering  the capital stock issuance and the credit agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements since we have had an agreement with a financial institution whereby we securitize  on a continuous basis  an undivided interest in a specific pool of our domestic trade accounts receivable 
we were permitted to securitize up to million of accounts receivable under this agreement 
in july  we entered into a new securitization program securitization program which also permitted us to securitize up to million of accounts receivable 
the securitization program was amended on september   permitting us to securitize up to million of accounts receivable 
the securitization program provides for a co purchase arrangement whereby two financial institutions participate in the purchase of our accounts receivables 
the actual amount of accounts receivable securitized each month is a function of the net change new billings less collections in the specific pool of domestic accounts receivable  the impact of detailed eligibility requirements in the agreement eg the aging  terms of payment  quality criteria and customer concentration  and the application of various reserves which are typically in trade receivable securitization transactions 
a decrease in the amount of eligible accounts receivable could result in our inability to continue to securitize all or a portion of our accounts receivable 
it is not unusual  however  for the amount of our eligible accounts receivable to vary by up to to million per month 
the financial institution charges us fees based on the level of accounts receivable securitized under this agreement and the commercial paper market rates plus the financial institution s cost to administer the program 
the costs incurred under this program  million  million and million in  and  respectively  are accounted for as a component of other expense  net and represent attractive funding costs compared to existing bank and public debt transactions 
at june  and  we securitized accounts receivable of million and million  respectively  under this program 
the securitization program is required to be renewed periodically  and it is our intention to continuously obtain that renewal when required 
the prior agreement expired on june  and was renewed to july   when the securitization program became effective 
the securitization program is a three year program  which contains certain provisions that require annual approval 
non renewal or non annual approval of this securitization program would result in our requirement to otherwise finance the amounts securitized 
we anticipate that the risk of non renewal or non annual approval of this securitization program with the current providers or some other providers is very low 
in the event of a decrease of our eligible accounts receivable or non renewal or non annual approval of our securitization program  we would have to utilize alternative sources of capital to fund that portion of our working capital needs 
capital expenditures for are estimated to be million and will be used primarily to support new strategic initiatives  new products and to upgrade machinery and equipment  almost all of which are discretionary 
financial condition at june   total assets were  million  an increase of percent from june  due predominantly to the acquisition of widia which increased total assets by million on august  net working capital was million  an increase of percent from million for  due to the widia acquisition and the impact of foreign exchange translation 
in  accounts receivable increased million to million  inventories also increased million to million compared to the increase in accounts receivable and inventory are directly related to the widia acquisition 
inventory turnover was in compared to in account receivable turnover increased from in to in the increase in account receivable and inventory turnover is a result of our continued focus on improving working capital and our successful integration of widia 
total debt including capital lease obligations and notes payable increased million or percent to million in higher debt was attributed primarily to the widia acquisition which resulted in net borrowings of million  the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates of approximately million  fixed to floating rate swaps of million and acquired debt from widia of million 
this was offset by repayments of million 
the ratio of debt to equity was percent at june  compared with percent at june  the increase is related to additional borrowings to fund the widia acquisition 
cash from operations and our debt capacity are expected to continue to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures  debt service obligations  share repurchases  dividend payments and operating requirements 
during  our accrued pension obligation increased million to million 
the significant increase in the pension obligation was due to approximately million from the widia acquisition and foreign exchange of million 
the remainder of the increase is due to a decrease in discount rates and expected returns on assets 
additionally during  we recorded an additional minimum pension liability associated with our pension plans 
this resulted in a charge to equity of million  net of tax  which is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
acquisition and divestitures on august   we purchased the widia group widia in europe and india from milacron inc for eur million million subject to a purchase price adjustment 
on february   milacron inc and kennametal signed a settlement agreement with respect to the calculation of the post closing purchase price adjustment for the widia acquisition pursuant to which milacron paid kennametal eur million million in cash 
the net cash purchase price of million includes the actual purchase price of million less the settlement of million plus million of direct acquisition costs million paid in fiscal year and million paid during the twelve months ended june  less million of acquired cash 
we financed the acquisition with funds borrowed under the credit agreement 
the acquisition of widia improves our global competitiveness  strengthens our european position and represents a strong platform for increased penetration in asia 
widia s operating results have been included in our consolidated results since august  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the preliminary purchase price allocations have been made based upon an estimated fair value of net assets acquired resulting in the recognition of approximately million of goodwill and million of other intangibles 
of the million of identifiable intangible assets approximately million have a definite life and therefore will be amortized over its remaining useful life 
in accordance with sfas no 
the goodwill will not be amortized but will instead be subject to an annual impairment test 
all goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the acquisition will be included in the mssg segment 
the preliminary purchase price allocations are subject to adjustment and may be modified within one year from the acquisition 
subsequent changes are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position 
in april  we sold strong tool company  our industrial supply distributor based in cleveland  ohio  for million comprised of cash proceeds of million and a seller note for million 
this action resulted in a pretax loss of million and is in line with our strategy to refocus the j l segment on its core catalog business 
annualized sales of this business were approximately million 
in january  we acquired carmet company for million 
located in duncan  sc  this entity is a producer of tungsten carbide cutting tools and wear parts and is included in our amsg segment 
in april  we sold ats  our industrial supply distributor based in salt lake city  utah  for million comprised of cash proceeds of million and a seller note for million 
this action resulted in a pretax loss of million and is in line with our strategy to refocus the j l segment on its core catalog business 
annualized sales of this business were approximately million 
in  we engaged an investment bank to explore strategic alternatives regarding our percent owned subsidiary  jlk direct distribution inc jlk  including a possible divestiture 
at that time  we believed a divestiture might enhance growth prospects for both ourselves and jlk by allowing each company to focus on its core competencies 
we completed a thorough and disciplined process of evaluating strategic alternatives and on may   decided to terminate consideration of a possible divestiture at that time 
we incurred and expensed million in costs associated with this evaluation in on july   we proposed to the board of directors of jlk to acquire the outstanding shares of jlk we did not already own 
on september   we announced a definitive merger agreement with jlk to acquire all the outstanding minority shares 
pursuant to the agreement  jlk agreed to initiate a cash tender offer for all of its shares of class a common stock at a price of per share 
the tender offer commenced on october  and expired on november  resulting in jlk reacquiring million shares for million 
following jlk s purchase of shares in the tender offer  we acquired the minority shares at the same price in a merger 
we incurred transaction costs of million  which were included in the total cost of the transaction 
jlk incurred costs of million associated with the transaction  which were expensed as incurred 
the transaction was unanimously approved by the jlk board of directors  including a special committee comprised of independent directors of the jlk board 
we continue to evaluate new opportunities that allow for the expansion of existing product lines into new market areas  either directly or indirectly through joint ventures  where appropriate 
environmental matters we are involved in various environmental cleanup and remediation activities at several of our manufacturing facilities 
in addition  we are currently named as a potentially responsible party prp at the li tungsten superfund site in glen cove  new york 
in december  we recorded a remediation reserve of million with respect to our involvement in these matters  which was recorded as a component of operating expense 
this represents our best estimate of the undiscounted future obligation based on our evaluations and discussions with outside counsel and independent consultants  and the current facts and circumstances related to these matters 
we recorded this liability because certain events occurred  including the identification of other prps  an assessment of potential remediation solutions and direction from the government for the remedial action plan  that clarified our level of involvement in these matters and our relationship to other prps 
this led us to conclude that it was probable that a liability had been incurred 
at june   we have an accrual of million recorded relative to this environmental issue 
in addition to the amount currently reserved  we may be subject to loss contingencies related to these matters estimated to be up to an additional million 
we believe that such undiscounted unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 
the reserved and unreserved liabilities for all environmental concerns could change substantially in the near term due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination  changes in remedial requirements  technological changes  discovery of new information  the financial strength of other prps  the identification of new prps and the involvement of and direction taken by the government on these matters 
additionally  we also maintain reserves for other potential environmental issues associated with our domestic operations and a location operated by our german subsidiary 
at june   the total of these accruals was million and represents anticipated costs associated with the remediation of these issues 
cash payments of million have been made against this reserve during the year 
during the due diligence phase of the widia acquisition  we identified certain environmental exposures with widia manufacturing locations in europe and india 
the purchase price paid reflected our estimate of this exposure 
as a result of the widia acquisition  we have established an environmental reserve of million which is consistent with our expectations determined during the due diligence process 
this reserve will be used for environmental clean up and remediation activities at several widia manufacturing locations 
this liability represents our best estimate of the future obligation based on our evaluations and discussions with independent consultants and the current facts and circumstances related to these matters 
this liability has been recorded as part of the widia acquisition and has not been reflected in our operating results 
we maintain a corporate environmental  health and safety eh s department  as well as an eh s policy committee  to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and to monitor and oversee remediation activities 
in addition  we have established an eh s administrator at each of our global manufacturing facilities 
our financial management team periodically meets with members of the corporate eh s department and the corporate legal department to review and evaluate the status of environmental projects and contingencies 
on a quarterly basis  we establish or adjust financial provisions and reserves for environmental contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
effects of inflation despite modest inflation in recent years  rising costs continue to affect our operations throughout the world 
we strive to minimize the effects of inflation through cost containment  productivity improvements and price increases under highly competitive conditions 
discussion of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
as part of our financial reporting process  our management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base our judgments and develops estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we use historical experience and available information to make these judgments and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
accounting for contingencies we accrue for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require our exercise of judgment both in assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating the amount of probable loss 
the significant contingencies affecting our financial statements include accounts and notes receivable collectibility  inventory valuation  environmental health and safety matters  pending litigation and the realization of deferred tax assets 
long lived assets as required under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill that are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include technological advances  changes in our business model  capital structure  economic conditions or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon  among other things  our assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we will recognize an impairment loss 
we continually apply our best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
in conjunction with the widia acquisition  we reviewed the estimated lives currently being used for existing kennametal assets  and have determined that the current useful lives should be extended to more appropriately match the life of the asset 
starting july   we have extended our useful lives of machinery and equipment from a maximum life of years to years 
we expect this change to result in an annual benefit of approximately million 
goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of the goodwill and other intangibles of each of our reporting units as required under sfas no 
by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
we apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of the financial projections used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits we sponsor these types of benefit plans for a majority of our employees and retirees 
we account for these plans as required under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
accounting for the cost of these plans requires the estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the expected work life of employees participating in these plans 
this estimation requires our judgment about the discount rate used to determine these obligations  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  rate of future health care costs  withdrawal and mortality rates and participant retirement age 
differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans 
due to the changes in assumptions and return on plan assets  we expect our pension and supplemental early executive retirement income to decrease from million in to expense of million in restructuring activities we accrue the cost of our restructuring activities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we exercise our judgment in estimating the total costs of each of these activities 
as we implement these activities  the actual costs may differ from the estimated costs due to changes in the facts and circumstances that were not foreseen at the time of our initial cost accrual 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the liability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze such factors as our historical bad debt experiences  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to worsen  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  income taxes realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income  the timing and amount of which are uncertain in part due to the expected profitability of certain foreign subsidiaries 
as of june   the deferred tax assets with valuation allowances are primarily attributable to postretirement benefits  inventory reserves and net operating loss carryforwards 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase in the valuation allowance would be required

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
as part of our formal documented risk management program  we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and therefore hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to dampen the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results and to achieve our targeted mix of fixed and floating interest rates on outstanding debt 
our objective in managing foreign exchange exposures with derivative instruments is to reduce both earnings and cash flow volatility  allowing us to focus our attention on business operations 
with respect to interest rate management  these derivative instruments allow us to achieve our targeted fixed to floating interest rate mix as a separate decision from funding arrangements in the bank and public debt markets 
we measure hedge effectiveness by assessing the changes in the fair value or expected future cash flows of the hedged item 
the ineffective portions are recorded in other income or expense in the current period 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we are exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance of derivative contracts and  in the event of nonperformance  to market risk for changes in interest and currency rates 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk through credit standards  diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the following provides additional information on our use of derivative instruments 
included below is a sensitivity analysis that is based upon a hypothetical percent weakening or strengthening in the us dollar compared to the june  foreign currency rates  the effective interest rates under our current borrowing arrangements and the market value of our available for sale securities 
we compared the contractual derivative and borrowing arrangements in effect at june  to the hypothetical foreign exchange or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on interest expense  pretax income  fair value of the available for sale securities or the accumulated other comprehensive loss 
our analysis takes into consideration the different types of derivative instruments and the applicability of hedge accounting 
cash flow hedges currency a portion of our operations consists of investments in foreign subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates arises from these investments  inter company loans utilized to finance these subsidiaries  trade receivables and payables  and firm commitments arising from international transactions 
we manage our foreign exchange transaction risk to reduce the volatility of cash flows caused by currency fluctuations through natural offsets  where appropriate  and foreign exchange contracts 
these contracts are designated as hedges of transactions that will settle in future periods  and otherwise would expose us to foreign currency risk 
our foreign exchange hedging program minimizes our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
this exposure arises largely from anticipated cash flows from cross border intercompany sales of products and services 
this program utilizes purchased options  range forwards and forward contracts primarily to sell foreign currency 
the notional amounts of the contracts translated into us dollars at june  and rates are million and million  respectively 
at june  and  a hypothetical percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar would not materially change pretax income related to these positions  however  accumulated other comprehensive loss would change by million and million  respectively 
in addition  we may enter into forward contracts to hedge transaction exposures or significant cross border intercompany loans by either purchasing or selling specified amounts of foreign currency at a specified date 
at june  and  we had several outstanding forward contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency  with notional amounts  translated into us dollars at june  and rates  of million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical percent change in the applicable and year end exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in pretax income of million and million  respectively  related to these positions 
interest rate our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk in order to balance our exposure between fixed and floating rates while attempting to minimize our borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to these borrowings 
at june  and  we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that effectively convert a notional amount of million and million  respectively  of debt from floating to fixed interest rates 
at june   these agreements mature in june of fair value hedges interest rate as discussed above  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
at june   we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding that effectively convert a notional amount of million of the senior unsecured notes from fixed to floating interest rates 
these agreements mature in june but provide for a one time optional early termination for the bank counterparty in june at the then prevailing market value of the swap agreements 
debt and notes payable at june  and  we had million and million  respectively  of debt and notes payable outstanding at effective interest rates of percent and percent  respectively  including the effect of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical change of percent in interest rates from year end and levels would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition to outstanding debt  at june  and we had million and million  respectively  of outstanding notes payable 
other our investment in toshiba tungaloy is classified as an available for sale security and  therefore  is carried at its quoted market value  adjusted for changes in currency exchange rates 
at june  and  the carrying and fair value of our investment was million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical change of percent in the quoted market value of this common stock at june  and would result in a million increase or decrease in fair value for both periods
