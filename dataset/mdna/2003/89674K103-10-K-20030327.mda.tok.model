item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k and the selected consolidated financial data above 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains both historical information and forward looking statements about us 
a number of factors affect our operating results and could cause our actual future results to differ materially from any forward looking results discussed below  including  but not limited to  those related to operating results  demand for integrated circuits  saw filters and optoelectronic components and the products into which they are manufactured  sales to a limited number of customers  new competitive technologies  growth and diversification of our markets  technologies and product applications  investments in new facilities  startup or integration of new facilities  equity investments in closely held companies  integration of our acquisitions of infineon s gaas business  ibm s wireless phone chipset business  agere s optoelectronics business and integration of any future acquisitions 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as anticipates  appears  believes  continue  estimates  expects  hope  intends  may  our future success depends  plans  potential  predicts  reasonably  seek to continue  should  thinks  will or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
actual events or results may differ materially 
in addition  historical information should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  the risks discussed in the section of this report titled factors affecting future operating results 
these factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statement 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
moreover  neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these statements 
we are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this annual report on form k to conform these statements to actual results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates  judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we review our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  sales returns reserves  inventory reserves  income tax valuation  warranty reserves  investment impairments  impairments of goodwill and long lived assets and commitments and contingencies on a regular basis and make adjustments based on historical experiences and existing and expected future conditions 
these evaluations are performed regularly and adjustments are made as information is available 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition standard product revenues are recognized upon shipment of product with provisions established for estimated customer and distributor product returns based on our experiences and or contractual agreements provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  price is fixed and determinable  title has transferred  collection is reasonably assured and there are no remaining significant obligations 
generally  we ship products fob shipping point 
we recognize revenues on certain foundry and customer specific products based on certain design  manufacturing and other milestones 
we recognize revenues on cost plus contracts as work is performed 
revenues from customers who have acceptance criteria is not recognized until all acceptance criteria are satisfied 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable represent those amounts which have been billed to our customers but not yet collected 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for the portion of those accounts which we determine may become uncollectible 
if we know of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce their receivable to an amount which we reasonably believe will be collectible 
for all other customers  we estimate the allowance based on the length of time past due  historical experience and judgement of economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions became worse than our expectations  our established allowance may not be sufficient and we may be required to provide additional allowances 
sales returns and allowances we record a sales return reserve for estimated sales returns and allowances 
a portion of our reserve is based on the contractual level of returns allowed to our distributors 
this portion is recorded in the same period that the related revenues are recorded 
a second portion is based on known quantities of products we expect to receive from specific customers for reasons we have agreed to which are unrelated to product warranty issues 
the third and final portion is a general reserve based on historical experience and our judgement of expected levels of returns 
if actual returns were higher than our estimates  our financial results would be adversely affected to the extent of the additional charges 
inventories and excess and obsolescence reserves we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we use a standard cost methodology to determine our cost basis for our inventories 
this methodology approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
in addition to costing our inventory at a lower of cost or market valuation  we also evaluate it each period for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes identifying those parts specifically identified as obsolete and reserving for them  analyzing forecasted demand versus quantities on hand and reserving for the excess  identifying and recording other specific reserves  and estimating and recording a general reserve based on historical experience and our judgement of economic conditions 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory reserves may be required and would be reflected in the financial statements in the period the adjustment is made 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
we evaluate the need for valuation allowance on a regular basis and adjust as needed 
these adjustments have an impact on our financial statements in the periods in which they are recorded 
in  we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded against all of our deferred tax assets based on the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
warranty costs we accrue for warranty costs based on a combination of factors including historical product return experience  known product warranty issues with specific customers  and judgement of expected levels of returns based on economic and other factors 
if we experience warranty claims in excess of our projections  additional accruals may need to be recorded which would adversely affect our financial results 
investments in privately held companies we have made several investments in small  privately held technology companies in which we hold less than of the capital stock or hold notes receivable 
we account for these investments using the cost method 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an other than temporary decline is evident 
we evaluate the financial condition of the investee  market conditions  and other factors providing an indication of the fair value of the investments 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the investees could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
in and we recorded an impairment charge of  and  respectively  on these investments due to deteriorating financial and market conditions 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment of their carrying value when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if impairment appears probable  we evaluate whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if this is the case  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
in and  we incurred significant impairment of the carrying values of our long lived assets and we may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 
goodwill we perform goodwill impairment tests at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant 
factors to be considered which would trigger an impairment review include a significant underperformance of the acquired assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline of our market capitalization below net book value 
in  we recognized an impairment charge related to the assets assigned to the oregon operating unit 
we recorded an impairment loss for the full value of all of our goodwill from recent acquisitions assigned to the oregon operating unit 
commitments and contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we may from time to time be involved in legal matters which may represent contingent liabilities or losses for us 
we may also enter into contracts or other agreements representing commitments to third parties 
a determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies  if any  would be a charge against earnings 
any required reserve could change in the future due to new developments or circumstances of each matter 
changes in required reserves could increase or decrease our earnings in the period the changes are made 
acquisitions merger with sawtek inc on july   sawtek inc became a wholly owned subsidiary of our company 
we issued approximately million shares of common stock in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of sawtek 
additionally  outstanding options to purchase sawtek common stock were exchanged for approximately million options to purchase our common stock 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests transaction and qualified as a tax free exchange of shares 
all financial information prior to the merger set forth in our consolidated financial statements and in this annual report on form k has been restated to include the historical information of sawtek 
our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  was combined with sawtek s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended september  our consolidated balance sheet as of december  was combined with sawtek s consolidated balance sheet as of september  sawtek s results for the quarter ended december  were  which was recorded as a component of our retained earnings 
acquisition of infineon s gaas business on july   we completed the acquisition of infineon s gaas business 
we added approximately employees as part of the acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction and the results of operations of this business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
at the closing date  we paid infineon eur million million at forward contract rate of 
eur  of which eur million million at forward contract rate of 
eur represents an earnout deposit 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  infineon may earn up to an additional eur million over a month period based upon revenues generated by the acquired business  for an aggregate purchase price of eur million 
subsequent to the completion of the acquisition  we also purchased certain fixed assets from infineon for eur million less eur million in funded liabilities acquired million at various spot rates 
there are also various other guarantees and contingencies which could affect the amount of the final purchase price 
in connection with this acquisition  we obtained a third party valuation of the assets for purposes of the purchase price allocation 
acquired in process research and development ipr d assets were expensed at the date of acquisition in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin  applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
the value assigned to ipr d related to research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
we determined the fair value using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value using a risk adjusted rate 
each project was analyzed to determine the following the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of completion 
we estimated future cash flows based upon our estimates of revenues expected to be generated upon completion of the projects and the beginning of commercial sales and related operating costs 
the projections assume that the technologies will be successful and that the product s development and commercialization will meet management s time schedule 
the discount rates utilized ranged from to and were based on the novelty of the technology  the risks remaining to complete each project  and the extent of our familiarity with the technology 
the estimated cost to complete this ipr d at the time of acquisition was approximately  the associated projects are still in process and on budget 
in connection with our acquisition of the infineon gaas business  we had the right to negotiate the purchase of infineon s hi rel business 
on october   the time period lapsed for us to reach a subsequent agreement as to our additional acquisition of infineon s hi rel business 
since an agreement was not reached  the minimum purchase price of the acquisition has been adjusted to eur million from eur million

we added nine employees as part of the acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase transaction and the results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
at the closing date  we paid million to ibm for the related assets  of which million represents an earnout deposit 
subsequent adjustments contingent upon business volumes could increase the final aggregate purchase price up to million 
in connection with this acquisition  we obtained a third party valuation of the assets for purposes of the purchase price allocation 
acquired ipr d assets were expensed at the date of acquisition in accordance with fin the value assigned to ipr d related to research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
we determined the fair value using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value using a risk adjusted rate 
each project was analyzed to determine the following the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of completion

the estimated cost to complete this ipr d at the time of acquisition was approximately  the associated projects are still in process and on budget 
acquisition of a portion of agere s optoelectronics business on january   we completed our acquisition of a substantial portion of the optoelectronics business of agere for million in cash plus acquisition costs and certain assumed liabilities 
we initially paid million on january  for the acquisition of the business and will pay million on or about april  for the related facilities 
the transaction included the products  technology and some facilities related to agere s optoelectronics business  which includes active and passive components  amplifiers  transceivers  transponders and other products 
as part of the transaction  approximately agere research and development  process engineering  marketing  product management and assembly and test employees joined our company 
approximately of these employees are located in pennsylvania and are located in matamoros  mexico 
we expect this business will have an operating loss in through a transition manufacturing agreement  agere will supply components for us until on or about april  to ensure seamless service to customers 
the majority of these components will be manufactured in agere s breinigsville  pennsylvania facility  which we will acquire following the transition period 
as part of the acquisition  we have also assumed operation of the back end assembly and test operations associated with these components at a leased facility in matamoros  mexico 
results of operations the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of revenues 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
years ended december  revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative impairment of long lived assets and goodwill acquisition related costs severance related costs total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net impairment of equity investments gain on retirement of debt other income expense  net income loss before income tax income tax expense benefit net income loss comparison of and revenues we derive revenues from the sale of standard and customer specific products and services 
our revenues also include nonrecurring engineering revenues relating to the development of customer specific products 
our markets during these comparative periods included wireless phones  infrastructure networks such as base station  satellite  and point to point  defense and optical networks 
revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease in revenues was due to decreased demand generally across all of our optical networking components and semiconductor products for wireless phones  offset by increased revenues from our saw filter business  particularly duplexers  rf filters and if filters for handsets 
domestic and international revenues were million and million  respectively  in as compared to million and million  respectively  in revenues are expected to be slightly higher in compared to primarily due to increased revenue from recently introduced products for wireless phones  full year impact of revenue from products associated with our infineon and ibm acquisitions and the addition of revenues from our optoelectronics business acquired form agere 
these increases in these markets will be offset somewhat by continued softness in the wireless infrastructure network and optical network markets and declines in average selling prices of certain of our products 
gross profit gross profit is equal to revenues less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes direct material  labor and overhead expenses and certain production costs related to nonrecurring engineering revenues 
in general  gross profit generated from the sale of customer specific products and from nonrecurring engineering revenues is typically higher than gross profit generated from the sale of standard products 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  gross profit margin decreased to in compared to in the decrease in gross profit was attributable to the decreased demand for our products  underutiliziation of our fabrication facilities and generally lower average selling prices of our wireless phone products due to increased competition and product standardization 
the operation of our own wafer fabrication facilities entails a high degree of fixed costs and requires an adequate volume of production and sales to be profitable 
during periods of decreased demand  as we have experienced recently  high fixed wafer fabrication costs have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
we expect gross profit to continue to be affected by decreased absorption of fixed overhead costs associated with decreased demand and production volume  which will continue to affect our results of operations for as long as demand continues at existing or lower levels 
additionally  we have at various times in the past experienced lower than expected production yields  which have delayed shipments of a given product and adversely affected gross profits 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain acceptable production yields in the future and  to the extent that we do not achieve acceptable production yields  our operating results would be materially adversely affected 
we expect our gross profit in to be lower  as a percentage of revenue  compared to this decrease will be attributable to a high level of transition costs associated with our newly acquired optoelectronics business  continued underutilization of our fabrication facilities and a continuing weakening of average selling prices for our products 
we believe these adverse conditions will be partially offset by increased demand for wireless products and the completion of the transfer of the fabrication of the products associated with the business we acquired from infineon to our oregon fabrication facility 
operating expenses research  development and engineering research  development and engineering expenses include the costs incurred in the design of new products  as well as ongoing product research and development expenses 
our research  development and engineering expenses increased in to million from million in research  development and engineering expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the increase in research  development and engineering expenses on an absolute dollar basis was primarily due to the additional research  development and engineering activities associated with our acquisition of the infineon and ibm businesses  to the engineering and requalification costs associated with the start up and move from our dallas facility to our richardson facility and to other costs associated with the increased investment in wireless  broadband and microwave products and technologies 
we announced several new products in  including several key products and projects  such as our first x mm sige power amplifiers  a foundry relationship with philips to develop hbt based wireless applications  significant progress in design wins and product development in gsm power amplifiers  switches and filters 
as a percentage of revenue  the increase from to is attributable to the increased spending as well as the decrease in revenue 
we are forecasting our research  development and engineering spending in to be higher compared to we intend to continue our investment in the technology areas mentioned above as well as others such as those associated with our further penetration into the optoelectronics market through our purchase of this business from agere 
we are committed to substantial investments in research  development and engineering and expect these expenses will continue to increase in the future 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses include commissions  labor expenses for marketing and administrative personnel  start up costs for our recent move to our richardson facility  costs associated with the acquisition of the infineon and ibm businesses and other corporate administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in compared to in this spending decrease was predominantly due to the reduced selling expenses associated with reduced revenues offset by costs for our move to our richardson facility and additional costs associated with our acquisition of the infineon and ibm businesses 
the increase as a percentage of revenue is a function of the decrease in revenue from to we expect our selling  general and administrative costs to increase in due to the added costs associated with the impact of recent acquisitions 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we evaluate long lived assets for impairment if certain events occur 
if impairment appears probable  we evaluate whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if this is the case  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
we perform goodwill impairment tests at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant 
factors to be considered which would trigger an impairment review include a significant underperformance of the acquired assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill increased to million in from million in the impairment charge in was the result of the write down of certain equipment and facilities due to excess capacity associated with the oregon operating unit 
in  the impairment charge was the result of the abandonment of million of certain production assets associated with one of our inch wafer productions lines at our richardson facility  the writedown of million of certain equipment and facilities associated with excess capacity at our oregon facility and the impairment of million of goodwill and other intangibles associated with our recent acquisitions of businesses from ibm and infineon 
the businesses acquired from ibm and infineon were assigned to the oregon operating unit when purchased 
the determination and recording of an impairment of the value of certain assets associated with the oregon operating units was an event which also required the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of the ibm and infineon businesses  since these businesses are associated with the oregon operating unit 
acquisition related costs during  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of acquired ipr d and other costs associated with our acquisition of the infineon and ibm businesses 
the value of acquired ipr d was determined through independent appraisal 
during  acquisition related costs were million and were attributable to the merger with sawtek in july these acquisition related costs consisted primarily of investment banker  legal  accounting  regulatory filing and printing fees 
severance related costs during  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees as a result of the decreased demand for our products and the underutilization of our fabrication facilities 
we recorded a charge of million associated with this reduction in workforce 
in  we recorded a charge for a similar reduction in workforce in the amount of million 
there is no remaining liability for the reduction in workforce for either of the years 
interest income expense interest income expense and other decreased to an expense of 
million in as compared to an income of million in this change was primarily attributable to lower interest rates earned on investments and a lower level of cash and short and long term investments due to our recent capital investments and acquisitions and the repurchase of million of our convertible subordinated notes in impairment of investments in privately held companies we have made several investments in small  privately held technology companies involved in broadband and optical networks in which we hold less than of the capital stock or hold notes receivable which are convertible into capital stock 
we account for these investments using the cost method 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an other than temporary decline is evident 
we evaluate the financial condition of the investee  market conditions and other factors providing an indication of the fair value of the investments 
during and  we recorded impairment losses of million and million  respectively  on these investments 
as of december   our remaining book balance of investments in privately held companies was million 
gain on retirement of long term debt a gain on retirement of debt resulted from our repurchase in of million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes at the then current market prices that resulted in a gain of million 
in we repurchased million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes at the then current market prices and which resulted in a gain of million 
from time to time  we may repurchase additional notes in the open market 
other  net other  net in was million compared to an expense of million in the majority of this change resulted from a realized gain of million on a forward currency contract associated with the infineon acquisition 
income tax expense benefit in  we recorded income tax expense of million compared to an income tax benefit of million recorded in the income tax expense in related to our determination that a valuation allowance should be recorded against all of our deferred tax assets based on the criteria of sfas concerning whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets may not be realized 
in  the income tax benefit related to the operating loss before tax 
our effective tax rate in was a benefit 
supplemental pro forma net income supplemental pro forma net income loss is not based on gaap  but is provided to explain the impact of certain significant items 
we believe that this disclosure is useful to our investors and creditors  as it is a way to explain the impact of certain accounting charges included in our operating results 
twelve months ended december  december  in thousands  except per share amounts net loss as reported  gaap   adjustments to net loss plus impairment of long lived assets   plus impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets  plus severance related costs   plus write off of certain equity investments   plus acquisition related costs   plus valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  less gain on retirement of a portion of debt   less gain on foreign currency hedging  subtotal adjustments   tax expense on adjustments computed at the effective tax rate for the period pro forma net income loss   pro forma earnings per share basic diluted earnings per share as reported based on gaap basic diluted comparison of and revenues revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease in revenues was due to the reduced sales of wireless phones  over capacity of optical networks resulting in lower sales of our components  lower overall demand for base stations as the operators cut back on capital spending and the overall depressed economy 
domestic and international revenues were million and million  respectively  in as compared to million and million  respectively  in gross profit gross profit decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  gross profit margin decreased to in compared to in this decrease was mainly due to lower factory utilization and  in part  by the reduction in average selling prices of certain saw filter products 
operating expenses research  development and engineering our research  development and engineering expenses increased in to million from million in research  development and engineering expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the increase in research  development and engineering expenses on an absolute dollar basis is primarily due to costs associated with the development of new products such as the hbt power amplifiers  sige based products  saw duplexers and various receivers 
additionally  we had engineering and requalification costs associated with the start up and move to our richardson facility 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased in to million from million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in compared to in while our revenues declined in  our selling  general and administrative expenses were essentially unchanged as these costs are somewhat fixed in the short term 
impairment of long lived assets impairment charge long lived assets was million in  which was a charge relating to the write down of certain equipment and facilities due to excess capacity 
we had no impairment charges in acquisition related costs acquisition related costs were million in  attributable to our merger with sawtek in july acquisition related costs consisted primarily of investment banker  legal  accounting  regulatory filings and printing fees associated with the merger of sawtek during the fiscal third quarter 
we had no acquisition related costs in other income expense  net other income expense  net decreased to an income of million in as compared to income of million in this decrease resulted primarily from decreased interest income due to the reduced interest rates on high quality short term securities and an impairment charge of million for investments in privately held technology companies 
these investments were in small companies whose valuations declined significantly in due to the overall decline in private technology company valuations 
gain on retirement of debt a gain on retirement of debt resulted from our repurchase in of million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes at the then current market prices 
this purchase resulted in a gain of million 
we had no similar item in income tax expense benefit in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million compared to the income tax expense of million recorded in the income tax benefit related to the operating loss before tax and extraordinary item recorded in our effective tax rate was a benefit in compared to a expense in outlook for based upon our forecasts of revenues and operating costs for  we expect to incur a net loss from operations in this forecast is based on our expectation of revenues being slightly higher in compared to primarily due to increased revenue from recently introduced products for wireless phones and the addition of revenues from products associated with our acquisition of businesses from infineon  ibm and agere 
these increases in revenues will be partially offset  however  by continued softness in the wireless infrastructure and optical network markets and declines in average selling prices of certain of our products 
in addition  we expect higher operating costs in compared to due to continued underutilization of our fabrication facilities  increased research and development spending in all of our market application areas including wireless  broadband  microwave and optoelectronics  and higher selling  general and administrative costs associated with our recent acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
in addition  we had million of investments in long term marketable securities  which are investments in high grade securities that mature after one year but within months 
as of december   working capital declined to million from million as of december  the decrease in working capital was attributable to the repurchase of convertible debt  purchases of the infineon and ibm businesses  purchases of equipment and investments in long term marketable securities 
for  and  cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities for was mainly due to certain non cash transactions such as depreciation and amortization  losses due to impairments of long lived assets and investments  and establishment of valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  partially offset by gains on retirement of debt and a forward foreign currency contract 
for and  cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income  tax benefit from stock option exercises and depreciation and amortization offset by increases in current assets 
for  and  cash used in investing activities were million  million  and million  respectively 
for  the cash used in investing activities was due to capital expenditures  purchases of the infineon and ibm businesses  investments in other companies and purchases of other investments  partially offset by sale maturity of marketable securities 
for and  cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchase of marketable securities and purchase of capital assets offset by sale maturity of marketable securities 
for  cash used in financing activities was million  which was primarily due to the repurchase of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes and partially offset by proceeds from issuance of stock 
for  cash used by financing activities was million and for cash provided by financing activities was million 
cash used in financing in was primarily due to the repurchase of a portion of our convertible subordinated note and the purchase of treasury stock  which was offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock activities 
in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the sale of our convertible subordinated notes 
in august  we acquired a  square foot wafer fabrication facility located in richardson  texas for million 
the acquisition was financed by a variable interest entity vie sponsored by a financial institution to which we contributed million and a lender contributed million 
in september  we completed an million improvement to the richardson  texas facility  which was financed through the same financial institution sponsored vie as part of the original financing agreement 
we contributed million and the lender contributed million 
of the total amount contributed to the vie  we are required to collateralize through pledged investment securities and a participation interest in the vie which amounts appear on our balance sheet as restricted long term assets and other investment  respectively 
as of december   we were in compliance with this requirement 
the vie is not consolidated in our financial statements and we have accounted for the arrangement as an operating lease 
we are required to make lease payments through august or may purchase the property 
if we elect to purchase the property  we will assign the pledged securities to the lender and incur some incremental closing costs to obtain title to the property 
at the end of the lease  we may elect to purchase the property  terminate the lease or renew the lease for two additional two year periods 
the lease is secured by the value of the property  of which we are subject to a guarantee of at least of its purchase value  as well as the pledged investment securities

as of december   we were in compliance with these restrictive covenants 
in february and march  we completed a private placement of million net proceeds of million of convertible subordinated notes due the notes are unsecured obligations  are initially convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share and are subordinated to all of our present and future senior indebtedness 
to date  we have repurchased approximately million of the convertible subordinated notes due from time to time  we evaluate opportunities to repurchase additional portions of the debt and may from time to time repurchase portions of the debt 
we have  in prior periods  completed public offerings of our common stock in order to fund our operating and capital needs 
in addition  we have funded our operations to date through other private sales of equity  borrowings  equipment leases and cash flow from operations 
on july   we completed the acquisition of infineon s gaas business 
we added approximately employees as part of the acquisition 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  infineon may earn up to an additional eur million over a month period based upon revenues generated by the acquired business  for an aggregate purchase price of eur million 
we intend to fund this additional obligation  if it arises  with cash generated by the acquired business 
in conjunction with our purchase of infineon s gaas business  we entered into an interim supply agreement whereby infineon is required to sell  and we are required to purchase eur   at december  exchange rate of eur of gaas business products during a one year period at stipulated prices 
the remaining commitment as of december  was eur   at december  exchange rate of eur 
on july   we completed the acquisition of a portion of the assets of ibm s wireless phone chipset business 
we added employees as part of the acquisition 
at the closing date  we paid million to ibm for the related assets 
subsequent adjustments contingent upon business volumes could increase the final aggregate purchase price up to million 
we intend to fund the payment of such additional amounts  if they arise  with cash generated by the acquired business 
on january   we completed our acquisition of a substantial portion of the optoelectronics business of agere for million in cash plus acquisition costs and certain assumed liabilities 
we initially paid million on january  for the acquisition of the business and will pay million on or about april  for the related facilities 
the transaction includes the products  technology and some facilities related to agere s optoelectronics business  which includes active and passive components  amplifiers  transceivers  transponders and other products 
as part of the transaction  approximately agere research and development  process engineering  marketing  product management and assembly and test employees will join our company 
approximately of these employees are located in pennsylvania and are located in matamoros  mexico 
through a transitional manufacturing agreement  agere will supply components for us for a short period following the close of the transaction to ensure seamless service to customers 
the majority of these components will be manufactured in agere s breinigsville  pennsylvania facility  which we will acquire following the transition period 
as part of the acquisition  we have also assumed operation of the back end assembly and test operations associated with these components at a leased facility in matamoros  mexico 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalent and short term investments balances  together with cash anticipated to be generated from operations and any financing arrangements we may enter into  will satisfy our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements and possible future acquisitions  at a minimum  through the next months 
however  we may be required to finance any additional requirements through additional equity  debt financings or credit facilities 
we may not be able to obtain additional financings or credit facilities  or if these funds are available  they may not be available on satisfactory terms

sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas is required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted sfas on january  and it is not expected to have a significant impact on us 
in june  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which changes the way companies will report the expenses related to restructuring 
sfas is required to be adopted for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements  and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
 which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  and the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have not yet determined if this will have a significant impact on us

this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  and to existing interest in the vie s after june  we have an interest in a vie as more fully discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
we have not yet determined the effect the application of this interpretation will have on our financial statements 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on operating costs and expenses 
factors that may affect future results an investment in our common stock is extremely risky 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  as well as assumptions that  if they never materialize or prove incorrect  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such statements reflect management s current expectations  assumptions and estimates of future performance and economic conditions 
such statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the following are some of the factors we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose part or all of your investment 
other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect us 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially  which may cause our stock price to fall 
our quarterly and annual results of operations have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors including  but not limited to  the following cancellation or delay of customer orders or shipments  our success in achieving design wins in which our products are designed into those of our customers  market acceptance of our products and those of our customers  variability of the life cycles of our customers products  variations in manufacturing yields  timing of announcements and introduction of new products by us and our competitors  changes in the mix of products we sell  declining average sales prices for our products  ability to integrate existing and newly developed technologies  changes in manufacturing capacity and variations in the utilization of that capacity  variations in operating expenses  the long sales cycles associated with our customer specific products  the timing and level of product and process development costs  performance of vendors and subcontractors  realization of research and development efforts  variations in raw material quality and costs  delays in new process qualification or delays in transferring processes  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor and electronic communications component industries  continued significant downturn in the wireless infrastructure network and optical network markets  the timing and level of nonrecurring engineering revenues and expenses relating to customer specific products  our ability to successfully integrate the operations of acquired businesses and to retain the customers of acquired businesses  significantly higher costs associated with integrating the operations of acquired businesses than we anticipated  and significant changes in our and our customers inventory levels 
we expect that our operating results will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of these and other factors 
any unfavorable changes in these or other factors could cause our results of operations to suffer as they have in the past 
due to potential fluctuations  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
additionally  if our operating results are not within the market s expectations  then our stock price may fall 
the public stock markets have experienced  and are currently experiencing  extreme price and trading volume volatility  particularly in high technology sectors of the market 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our operating results may suffer due to fluctuations in demand for semiconductors and electronic communications components 
from time to time  the wireless phone  infrastructure network  optical network  and defense markets have experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles  capital spending cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
this cyclical nature of these markets has led to significant imbalances in demand  inventory levels and production capacity 
it has also accelerated the decrease of average selling prices per unit 
we have experienced  and may experience again  periodic fluctuations in our financial results because of these or other industry wide conditions 
we expect that the current decline in demand for various elements of the wireless phone  infrastructure network  optical network and defense components  including ours  could last throughout  if not longer 
for example  if demand for communications applications were to decrease substantially  demand for the integrated circuits and modules  optical components and modules and saw filter components in these applications would also decline  which would negatively affect our operating results 
we depend on the continued growth of communications markets 
we derive all of our product revenues from sales of products for electronic communication applications 
these markets are characterized by the following cyclical demand  intense competition  rapid technological change  and short product life cycles  especially in the wireless phone market 
recently  the electronic communications markets have reversed their previous pattern of growth 
these markets may not resume historical growth rates 
if these markets do not recover and demand for electronic communications applications continues to decline  our operating results could suffer 
in addition  to the extent this economic downturn affects our customers business  it may affect their ability to pay us for products we have already shipped to them 
products for electronic communications applications are often based on industry standards  which are continually evolving 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products based on emerging industry standards  which could render our existing products unmarketable or obsolete 
if communications markets evolve to new standards  we may be unable to successfully design and manufacture new products that address the needs of our customers or that will meet with substantial market acceptance 
our revenues are at risk if we do not introduce new products and or decrease costs 
historically  the average selling prices of some of our products have decreased over the products lives and we expect them to continue to do so 
to offset these decreases  we rely primarily on achieving yield improvements and other cost reductions for existing products and on introducing new products that can often be sold at higher average selling prices 
selling prices for our saw products have declined due to competitive pricing pressures and to the use of newer surface mount package devices that are smaller and less expensive than previous generation filters 
for example  we have experienced declines in average selling prices for rf filters for wireless phones due to competitive pressure and filters for base stations due to the use of surface mount packages 
we believe our future success depends  in part  on our timely development and introduction of new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and adequately address customer requirements 
the success of new product and process introductions depends on several factors  including proper selection of products and processes  successful and timely completion of product and process development and commercialization  market acceptance of our or our customers new products  achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields  and our ability to offer new products at competitive prices 
our product and process development efforts may not be successful and our new products or processes may not achieve market acceptance 
to the extent that our cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner  our results of operations could suffer 
if we fail to sell a high volume of products  our operating results will be harmed 
because large portions of our manufacturing costs are relatively fixed  our manufacturing volumes are critical to our operating results 
if we fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing volumes or experience product shipment delays  our results of operations could be harmed 
during periods of decreased demand  as we are currently experiencing  our high fixed manufacturing costs negatively effect our results of operations 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectations of future orders and these expense levels are predominantly fixed in the short term 
however  if the rate of growth of demand continues to decrease from past levels  as we are currently experiencing  we will not be able to grow our revenue 
if we receive fewer customer orders than expected or if our customers delay or cancel orders  we may not be able to reduce our manufacturing costs in the short term and our operating results would be harmed 
if we do not sell our customer specific products in large volumes  our operating results may be harmed 
we manufacture a substantial portion of our products to address the needs of individual customers 
frequent product introductions by systems manufacturers make our future success dependent on our ability to select development projects  which will result in sufficient volumes to enable us to achieve manufacturing efficiencies 
because customer specific products are developed for unique applications  we expect that some of our current and future customer specific products may never be produced in volume and may impair our ability to cover our fixed manufacturing costs 
furthermore  if customers cancel or delay orders for these customer specific products  our inventory of these products may become unmarketable or obsolete  which would negatively affect our operating results 
in addition  if we experience delays in completing designs  if we fail to obtain development contracts from customers whose products are successful or if we fail to have our product designed into the next generation product of existing volume production customers  our revenues could be harmed 
increases in our manufacturing capacity may adversely affect our operating results if the current economic downturn continues for an extended period of time 
we have converted our hillsboro facility from four inch wafer production to six inch wafer production and have recently expanded the capacity of our texas operations with the transition to the richardson facility 
in addition  we have acquired additional manufacturing facilities and personnel in connection with our recent acquisition of businesses from infineon  ibm and agere 
these increases in capacity will directly relate to significant increases in fixed costs and operating expenses 
these increased costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations during the current economic downturn 
if this economic downturn were to continue for an extended period of time  the decreased levels of demand and production in conjunction with these increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face challenges and risks associated with our acquisition of the optoelectronics business of agere and  as a result  may not realize the expected benefit of this acquisition 
on january   we completed of the acquisition of a substantial portion of the optoelectronics business of agere for million in cash plus acquisition costs and certain assumed liabilities 
we initially paid million on january  for the acquisition of the business and will pay million on or about april  for the related facilities 
the transaction includes the products  technology and some facilities related to agere s optoelectronics business  which includes active and passive components  amplifiers  transceivers  transponders and other products 
our risks associated with this acquisition include our ability to conduct business successfully selling products which we have not previously sold and to support these markets with a substantially smaller sales force than that of agere  our ability to successfully consolidate all manufacturing operations into the breinigsville  matamoros and richardson facilities without disrupting product shipments to customers  our ability to establish systems and other support infrastructure on a timely basis  our ability to manage a facility in mexico and our ability to absorb the incremental costs and regulatory compliance required for an additional foreign subsidiary  our ability to continue and integrate manufacturing processes substantially different from our current processes  our ability to generate sufficient revenues to offset the operating costs of the agere business due to a continued depressed market for optoelectronics products  the costs we may face from warranty claims associated with products shipped by agere prior to our acquisition of the business  agere s ability to support us and the business through a transition period and our ability to sustain the business once the transition period has expired  our ability to retain existing partners and customers of the agere business  our ability to retain agere s employees and to integrate them into our corporate culture  our ability to dedicate significant management attention and financial resources needed to assimilate these businesses without harming our existing business  and increased complexity of our corporate structure requiring additional resources for such responsibilities as tax planning  foreign currency management  financial reporting and risk management 
we may face challenges with the integration of our acquisition of infineon s gaas business and the acquired assets of ibm s wireless phone chipset business and  as a result  may not realize the expected benefits of those acquisitions 
on july   we completed the acquisition of infineon s gaas semiconductor business and a portion of the assets of ibm s wireless phone chipset business 
the challenges involved in integrating these businesses include realization of expected benefits from the acquisitions such as increased business in europe  fulfillment of the supply agreement between infineon and us until we are able to produce the products within our existing facilities  retention of existing partners and customers  transfer and integration of infineon s process and technologies into our oregon facility  redesign of infineon products to allow for manufacture in our oregon facility  retention of infineon s and ibm s employees and their integration into the our corporate culture  incremental costs associated with a foreign subsidiary such as taxes  duties and employee benefits  significant management attention and financial resources needed to assimilate these businesses  and increased complexity of our corporate structure requiring additional resources for such responsibilities as tax planning  foreign currency management and risk management 
we face continuing challenges in integrating sawtek and  as a result  may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition of sawtek 
integrating the operations  systems and personnel of triquint and sawtek  as with all mergers of companies  is a complex process 
areas in which we are still working on full integration include coordinating research and development activities to enhance introduction of new products  services and technologies  combining product and service offerings and marketing efforts  offering integrated products and services of triquint and sawtek to each other s customers and partners  and developing  maintaining and combining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies 
we may not fully succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the merger 
the diversion of the attention of our management and any difficulties encountered in the process of combining the companies could cause the disruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of our business 
we cannot assure you that these remaining integration issues can be successfully resolved in a timely manner or at all or that any of the anticipated benefits will be realized 
if investors or financial or industry analysts do not think our integration of our acquisitions are proceeding as anticipated or that the benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized  the market price of our common stock may decline 
the market price of our common stock may decline if the integration of our acquisitions is not completed in a timely and efficient manner  our assumptions about our acquisitions business models and operations are incorrect  considered on a stand alone basis  or their role in our business model does not develop as we plan  we are unable to introduce new products incorporating acquired technology  the effect of the acquisitions on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts  or following the acquisitions  our stockholders that hold relatively larger interests in our company may decide to dispose of their shares because the results of the acquisitions are not consistent with their expectations 
we are currently undergoing a management transition 
in july  we announced the appointment of ralph quinsey as our president and chief executive officer 
steven j 
sharp  our former president and chief executive officer  who announced his intent to reduce his involvement in the day to day management of our company in october  remains our chairman of the board 
in addition  we recently announced a corporate reorganization of our company into multiple business units  some of which are managed by two or more vice presidents 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to execute this management transition and reorganization and on the ability of our executive officers to operate effectively  both independently and as a group 
the manner in which the new management team conducts the business of our company  and the direction in which the new management team moves the business  may differ from the manner and direction in which the former management has directed our company in the past 
if we fail to execute this management transition effectively  our operating results could be negatively affected 
our operating results may suffer should any issues arise relative to the recently completed transfer of our manufacturing operations from our former leased dallas facility to our new richardson  texas facility 
we completed our transfer to our new facility in richardson  texas in july of although the transition appears to have gone smoothly  there is the possibility that issues could still arise that could adversely impact our ability to produce products that meet the strenuous requirements our customers specify 
the transfer of wafer fabrication processes involves a number of significant risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  manufacturing transition  startup or process problems  construction  process qualification  equipment delays  cost overruns or shortages of equipment or materials  any of which may also adversely affect yields 
there could also be additional warranty liability risk due to potential unforeseen issues related to material manufactured during the transition period 
significant investment was made in making this transfer and we expect the cost of the transfer is nearly complete 
we could  however  still encounter unforeseen difficulties requiring substantial and unplanned expenditures to fully complete the transfer 
any of these risks could adversely impact our operating results 
we face risks from failures in our manufacturing processes  the maintenance of our fabrication facilities and the processes of our vendors 
the fabrication of integrated circuits  particularly those made of gaas  is a highly complex and precise process 
our integrated circuits are currently manufactured on wafers made of gaas  inp  linbo and sige 
our sige products are manufactured externally by atmel  our strategic partner in the development of these products and by ibm 
our saw filters are currently manufactured primarily on linbo  litao and quartz wafers 
during manufacturing  each wafer is processed to contain numerous integrated circuits or saw filters 
we may reject or be unable to sell a substantial percentage of wafers or the components on a given wafer because of minute impurities  difficulties in the fabrication process  such as failure of special equipment  operator error or power outages  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  electrical and or optical performance  wafer breakage  or other factors 
we refer to the proportion of final components that have been processed  assembled and tested relative to the gross number of components that could be constructed from the raw materials as our manufacturing yield 
compared to the manufacture of silicon integrated circuits  gaas technology is less mature and more difficult to design and manufacture within specifications in large volume 
in addition  the more brittle nature of gaas wafers can result in lower manufacturing yields than with silicon wafers 
we have in the past experienced lower than expected manufacturing yields  which have delayed product shipments and negatively impacted our results of operations 
we may experience difficulty maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
in addition  the maintenance of our fabrication facilities and our assembly facilities are subject to risks  including the demands of managing and coordinating workflow between geographically separate production facilities  disruption of production in one of our facilities as a result of a slowdown or shutdown in our other facility  and higher operating costs from managing geographically separate manufacturing facilities 
we depend on certain vendors for components  equipment and services 
we maintain stringent policies regarding qualification of these vendors 
however  if these vendors processes vary in reliability or quality  they could negatively affect our products  and thereby  our results of operations 
we face risks from an increasing proportion of our operations and employees being located outside of the united states 
as we continue to expand our operations  an increasing number of our employees and operations are located in countries other than the united states 
the laws and governance of these countries may differ substantially from that of the united states and may expose us to increased risks of adverse impacts on our operations and results of operations 
these risks could include loss of protection of proprietary technology  disruption of production processes  interruption of freight channels and delivery schedules  currency exposure  financial institution failure  government expropriation  labor shortages  and political unrest 
some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas prone to natural disasters 
we have a saw manufacturing and assembly facility located in apopka  florida 
we also have an assembly facility for saw products in san jose  costa rica 
hurricanes  tropical storms  flooding  tornadoes  and other natural disasters are common events for the southeastern part of the united states and in central america 
additionally  mud slides  earthquakes and volcanic eruptions could also affect our costa rican facility 
any disruptions from these or other events would have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 
although we have manufacturing and assembly capabilities for our sawtek products in both apopka and san jose  we are only capable of fabricating wafers for those products in our apopka facility 
as a result  any disruption to our apopka facility would have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 
a disruption in our costa rican  mexican or chinese operations would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
operating facilities in costa rica  mexico and china presents risks of disruption such as government intervention  currency fluctuations  labor disputes  limited supplies of labor  power interruption or war 
any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our costa rican operation has been a significant contributor to our operating results in the past 
we expect our costa rican operations to continue to account for a significant proportion of our saw operations in the future  our chinese operation to serve significant customers and our mexican operation to be an important part of our optoelectronics component business 
any disruption in these operations would have a significant negative impact on our operating results 
we face risks from changes in tax regulations and a change in our cost rican subsidiary s favorable tax status would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we are subject to taxation in many different countries and localities worldwide 
in some jurisdictions  we have employed specific business strategies to minimize our tax exposure 
to the extent the tax laws and regulations in these various countries and localities could change  our tax liability in general could increase or our tax saving strategies could be threatened 
such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
for example  our subsidiary in costa rica operates in a free trade zone 
we expect to receive a exemption from costa rican income taxes through  a exemption through and a exemption through the costa rican government continues to review its policy on granting tax exemptions to companies located in free trade zones and it may change our tax status or minimize our benefit at any time 
any adverse change in the tax structure for our costa rican subsidiary made by the costa rican government would have a negative impact on our net income 
our business may be adversely affected by acts of terrorism or war 
acts of terrorism or war could interrupt or restrict our business in several ways 
we rely extensively on the use of air transportation to move our inventory to and from our vendors and to ship finished products to our customers 
if war or terrorist acts cause air transportation to be grounded or interrupted  our business would be similarly adversely impacted 
in addition  war or acts of terrorism could cause existing export regulations to be changed  which could limit the extent to which we are allowed to export our products 
to the extent that war or acts of terrorism also reduce customer confidence and create general economic weakness  our business would also be adversely affected 
our operating results could be harmed if we lose access to sole or limited sources of materials  equipment or services 
we currently obtain some components  equipment and services for our products from limited or single sources  such as certain ceramic packages and chemicals 
we purchase these components  equipment  supplies and services on a purchase order basis  do not carry significant inventories and generally do not have long term supply contracts with these vendors 
our requirements are relatively small compared to silicon semiconductor manufacturers 
because we often do not account for a significant part of our vendors business  we may not have access to sufficient capacity from these vendors in periods of high demand 
if we were to change any of our sole or limited source vendors  we would be required to requalify each new vendor 
requalification could prevent or delay product shipments  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
our reliance on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and parts may impair our ability to produce our products on time and in acceptable yields 
for example  at times in the past  we have experienced difficulties in obtaining ceramic packages used in the production of bandpass filters 
at other times  the acquisition of relatively simple devices  such as capacitors  has been problematic because of the large demand swings that can occur in the cellular handset market for such components 
our newly acquired optical components group is dependent upon a large number of suppliers  some of which are very small companies  for components that make up their integrated product offerings such as transceivers  transponders and optical amplifiers 
the success of these products is critical to the overall success of our business 
the primary risk to our source of supply to manufacture these products is the currently depressed state of the optical network market and its potential impact on smaller vendors in terms of possible bankruptcy or inability to meet delivery schedules 
in addition  our reliance on these vendors may negatively affect our production if the components  equipment or services vary in reliability or quality 
if we are unable to obtain timely deliveries of sufficient quantities of acceptable quality or if the prices increase  our results of operations could be harmed 
our operating results could be harmed if our subcontractors and partners are unable to fulfill our requirements 
we currently utilize subcontractors for the majority of our integrated circuit and module assemblies 
our strategic partners  ibm and atmel  also manufacture all of our sige products 
infineon continues to manufacture our products acquired from them while we transfer the manufacturing processes to our oregon facility 
infineon will also continue to provide assembly and test services for an indeterminant period of time after the transfer of the manufacturing processes 
there are certain risks associated with dependence on third party providers  such as minimal control over delivery scheduling  adequate capacity during demand peaks  warranty issues and protection of intellectual property 
additionally  if these subcontractors are unable to meet our needs  it could prevent or delay production shipments that could negatively affect our results of operations 
if we were to change any of our subcontractors  we would be required to requalify each new subcontractor  which could also prevent or delay product shipments that could negatively affect our results of operations 
in addition  our reliance on these subcontractors may negatively affect our production if the services vary in reliability or quality 
if we are unable to obtain timely service of acceptable quality or if the prices increase  our results of operations could be harmed 
if our products fail to perform or meet customer requirements  we could incur significant additional costs 
the fabrication of integrated circuits and saw filters from substrate materials such as gaas  sige  inp  linbo  litao and quartz and the modules containing these components is a highly complex and precise process 
our customers specify quality  performance and reliability standards that we must meet 
if our products do not meet these standards  we may be required to rework or replace the products 
our products may contain undetected defects or failures that only become evident after we commence volume shipments 
we have experienced product quality  performance or reliability problems from time to time 
we are currently experiencing field failures and returns on some components and are collecting data for analysis and evaluation as to the extent of the problem 
other defects or failures may also occur in the future 
if failures or defects occur  we could lose revenues  incur increased costs such as warranty expense and costs associated with customer support  experience delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders for our products  or experience increased product returns or discounts 
we may face fines or our facilities could be closed if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 
federal  state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing process 
for our manufacturing facilities  we generally provide our own manufacturing waste treatment and contract for disposal of some materials 
we are required to report usage of environmentally hazardous materials 
the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us and we could be required to suspend production or cease our operations 
these regulations could require us to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
any failure by us to control the use of  or to adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and harm our results of operations 
our business will be impacted if systems manufacturers do not use components made of gaas or other alternative materials we utilize 
silicon semiconductor technologies are the dominant process technologies for integrated circuits and the performance of silicon integrated circuits continues to improve 
recently  we introduced sige components jointly developed and manufactured with atmel and acquired the sige wireless chipset business of ibm 
system designers may be reluctant to adopt our products because of their unfamiliarity with designing systems with our products  their concerns related to manufacturing costs and yields  their unfamiliarity with our design and manufacturing processes  and uncertainties about the relative cost effectiveness of our products compared to high performance silicon components 
systems manufacturers may not use gaas components because the production of gaas integrated circuits has been  and continues to be  more costly than the production of silicon devices 
systems manufacturers may not use our sige components because this is a newly introduced process 
systems manufacturers may be reluctant to rely on a technology that is new to us and not widely understood 
systems manufacturers may also be reluctant to rely on a jointly produced product because future supplies may depend on the continued good relationships with atmel and ibm 
as a result  we must offer devices that provide superior performance to that of traditional silicon based devices 
our recently acquired optoelectronics business may be negatively impacted if our customers were to move to a non linbo modulator product base  or if the customers of this business refuse to recognize the product qualification status of the acquired product offerings 
the very demanding product qualification process in these relatively immature technologies is typically characterized by long and expensive cycles 
in addition  customers may be reluctant to rely on a smaller company like us for critical components 
we cannot be certain that additional systems manufacturers will design our products into their systems or that the companies that have utilized our products will continue to do so in the future 
if our products fail to achieve market acceptance  our results of operations would suffer 
new competitive products and technologies have been announced which could reduce demand for our saw filter products 
products have been introduced that may have some application in gsm phones  which will impact sales of gsm if filters for wireless phones 
several companies recently announced a new product based on a direct conversion concept that could potentially eliminate a saw if filter in certain cdma phones 
if these products are successful in the market  it could reduce or eliminate demand for our if filters for cdma phones and our revenues would be harmed if we do not introduce competitive or alternative products 
saw if filters for wireless phones accounted for approximately of our revenues in any development of a cost effective and reliable technology that replaces saw filtering technology or reduces the need for saw filtering technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a decline either in the growth of wireless communications or in the continued acceptance of cdma technology  particularly in emerging markets  would have an adverse impact on us 
our products for cdma based systems  including filters for base stations and receivers and power amplifiers for wireless phones comprise a significant part of our business 
cdma technology is relatively new to the marketplace and there can be no assurance that emerging markets  such as china and india  will adopt this technology 
our business and financial results would be adversely impacted if cdma technology does not continue to gain acceptance 
our business may be adversely impacted if we fail to successfully introduce new products or to gain our customers acceptance of those new products 
the markets for electronic communications applications in which we participate are subject to intense competition  rapid technological change  and short product life cycles 
it is critical for companies such as ours to continually and quickly develop new products to meet the changing needs of these markets 
if we fail to develop new products to meet our customers needs on a timely basis  we will not be able to effectively compete in these markets 
for example  we announced our intention to develop and market rf front end modules for wireless phones at cost effective prices 
we will also need to continue to expand our wireless applications into cdma and gsm applications 
if we fail to design and produce these products in a manner acceptable to our customers or have incorrectly anticipated our customers demand for these types of products  our operating results could be harmed 
our business will be adversely impacted if we do not gain market acceptance of our wireless phone module products 
our strategy for wireless phone products depends in large part upon the success of our design and marketing of wireless phone modules 
wireless phone modules represent the incorporation of some or all of the components of the wireless phone radio into a single product 
if we are unable to design these modules in a manner acceptable to our customers  have incorrectly anticipated our customers demand for these products or are unable to cost effectively produce them  our operating results will be adversely affected 
we have substantial indebtedness 
we have million of indebtedness remaining in the form of our convertible subordinated notes due in our other indebtedness is for operating and capital leases 
we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on the notes and leases  make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  which would reduce the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to  changes in our business  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations  including our obligation under the notes 
we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations 
if our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or our other obligations  we would be in default under the terms thereof 
default under the indenture would permit the holders of the notes to accelerate the maturity of the notes and could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur 
any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we can not assure you that we would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the notes if payment of the notes were to be accelerated following the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the indenture 
customers may delay or cancel orders due to regulatory delays 
the increasing significance of electronic communications products has increased pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for electronic communications  generally following extensive investigation of and deliberation over competing technologies 
the delays inherent in the regulatory approval process may in the future cause the cancellation  postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by our customers 
these delays have in the past had  and may in the future have  a negative effect on our sales and our results of operations 
we must improve our products and processes to remain competitive 
if technologies or standards supported by our or our customers products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance  our results of operations may be materially impacted 
because of continual improvements in semiconductor technology  including those in high performance silicon technologies such as cmos  where substantially more resources are invested than in other technologies such as gaas  sige or saw products  we believe that our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to improve our product and process technologies 
we must also develop new technologies in a timely manner 
in addition  we must adapt our products and processes to technological changes and to support emerging and established industry standards 
we have and must continue to perform significant research and development into advanced material development such as inp  gallium nitride gan  silicon carbide sic and sige to compete with future technologies of our competitors 
for example  we have entered into agreements with atmel and ibm to fabricate portions of our new sige products 
these research and development efforts may not be accepted by our customers  and therefore may not achieve sustained production in the future 
we may not be able to improve our existing products and process technologies  develop new technologies in a timely manner or effectively support industry standards 
if we fail to do so  our customers may select another gaas  sige or saw product or move to an alternative technology 
our results of operations may suffer if we do not compete successfully 
the markets for our products are characterized by price competition  rapid technological change  short product life cycles  and heightened global competition 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources 
due to the increasing requirements for high speed  high frequency components  we expect intensified competition from existing integrated circuit and saw device suppliers  as well as from the entry of new competitors to our target markets and from the internal operations of some companies producing products similar to ours for their internal requirements 
several key customers in our newly acquired optoelectronics business have either captive internal suppliers or long term contractual relationships with suppliers based on factors other than cost and quality 
for products in depressed markets  such as for optical components and modules  competition can be even more intense as companies attempt to maximize their revenue to cover as much of their fixed cost base as possible  even if it means selling products at a loss 
there is no guarantee that pricing will stay at a level where we can sell our products on a profitable basis 
for our integrated circuit devices  we compete primarily with both manufacturers of high performance silicon integrated circuits as well as manufacturers of gaas integrated circuits 
our silicon based competitors include companies such as applied micro circuits corporation  maxim integrated products inc  motorola  philips  stmicroelectronics n 
v and others 
our gaas based competitors include companies such as anadigics inc  fujitsu microelectronics  inc  raytheon  rf micro devices  skyworks solutions  inc  vitesse semiconductor corp and others 
for our saw devices our competitors include companies such as cts wireless components  micro networks  phonon  rf monolithics  vectron  epcos ag  thales  fujitsu  murata  toyocom and others 
competition could also come from companies ahead of us in developing alternative technologies such as sige and inp integrated circuits and digital filtering and direct conversion devices 
competition from existing or potential competitors may increase due to a number of factors including  but not limited to  the following offering of new or emerging technologies in integrated circuit or optical component design using alternative materials such as sige or inp  offering of new or emerging technologies such as digital filtering or direct conversion as alternatives to saw filters  transition to arrays of optical sources and detectors in place of discrete lasers in systems and subsystems  mergers and acquisitions  longer operating histories and presence in key markets  development of strategic relationships  access to a wider customer base  and access to greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources 
additionally  manufacturers of high performance silicon integrated circuits have achieved greater market acceptance of their existing products and technologies in some applications 
we compete with both gaas and silicon suppliers in all of our target markets 
in microwave and millimeter wave applications  our competition is primarily from a limited number of gaas suppliers  which are in the process of expanding their product offerings to address commercial applications other than aerospace 
our prospective customers are typically systems designers and manufacturers that are considering the use of gaas or sige integrated circuits or saw filters  as the case may be  for their high performance systems 
competition is primarily based on performance elements such as speed  complexity and power dissipation  as well as price  product quality and ability to deliver products in a timely fashion 
due to the proprietary nature of our products  competition occurs almost exclusively at the system design stage 
as a result  a design win by our competitors or by us typically limits further competition with respect to manufacturing a given design 
if we fail to integrate any future acquisitions or successfully invest in privately held companies  our business will be harmed 
we face risks from any future acquisitions  including the following we may fail to merge and coordinate the operations and personnel of newly acquired companies with our existing business  we may fail to retain the key employees required to make the operation successful  additional complexity may affect our flexibility and ability to respond quickly to market and management issues  we may experience difficulties integrating our financial and operating systems  we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning  treasury management  financial reporting and risk management  our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention  we may not cost effectively and rapidly incorporate the technologies we acquire  we may not be able to recognize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated  we may not be able to retain the existing customers of newly acquired operations  existing customers of the acquired operations may demand significant price reductions or other detrimental term changes as a result of the change in ownership  our corporate culture may clash with that of the acquired businesses  we may incur unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses  and our increasing international presence resulting from acquisitions increases our exposure to foreign political  currency  and tax risks 
we face risks from equity investments in privately held companies  such as we may not realize the expected benefits associated with the investment  we may need to provide additional funding to support the privately held company  or if their value decreases  we may realize losses on our holdings 
we may not successfully address these risks or any other problems that arise in connection with future acquisitions or equity investments in privately held companies 
we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and we may pursue product  technology or business acquisitions or investments in strategic partners 
in addition  in connection with any future acquisitions  we may issue equity securities that could dilute the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders  we may incur additional debt and we may be required to amortize expenses related to other intangible assets or record impairment of goodwill that may negatively affect our results of operations 
if we do not hire and retain key employees  our business will suffer 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical  marketing and management personnel 
we also depend on our ability to continue to identify  attract and retain qualified technical employees  particularly highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the manufacture and development of our products and processes 
we must also recruit and train employees to manufacture our products without a substantial reduction in manufacturing yields 
there are many other semiconductor companies located in the communities near our facilities and it may become increasingly difficult for us to attract and retain those employees 
the competition for key employees is intense  and the loss of key employees could negatively affect us 
our business may be harmed if we fail to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we currently have patents granted and pending in the united states and elsewhere and intend to seek further international and united states patents on our technology 
in addition to our own inventions  we have acquired a substantial portfolio of us and foreign patent applications in the optoelectronics area of technology 
these applications are just starting to issue as patents  and will have lives that will extend years from their respective filing dates 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold or that any claims allowed from pending applications or will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage 
our competitors may also be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  increasing the possibility of piracy of our technology and products 
although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
our competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
our involvement in any patent dispute or other intellectual property dispute or action to protect trade secrets and know how could have a material adverse effect on our business 
adverse determinations in any litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties and prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products 
any of these situations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our ability to produce our products may suffer if someone claims we infringe on their intellectual property 
the integrated circuit and saw device industries are characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
if it is necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot be certain that licenses will be offered or that we would find the terms of licenses that are offered acceptable or commercially reasonable 
our failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of products 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
litigation by or against us could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical personnel and management  whether or not the litigation results in a favorable determination 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  indemnify our customers  stop the manufacture  use and sale of the infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes  or obtain licenses to the technology 
we may be unsuccessful in developing non infringing products or negotiating licenses upon reasonable terms  or at all 
these problems might not be resolved in time to avoid harming our results of operations 
if any third party makes a successful claim against our customers or us and a license is not made available to us on commercially reasonable terms  our business could be harmed 
our business may suffer due to risks associated with international sales 
our sales outside of the united states were of revenues in and of revenues in we face inherent risks from these sales  including imposition of government controls  currency exchange fluctuations  longer payment cycles and difficulties related to the collection of receivables from international customers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  unfavorable tax consequences  difficulty obtaining distribution and support  political instability  and tariffs and other trade barriers 
in addition  due to the technological advantages provided by gaas integrated circuits in many military applications  the office of export administration of the us department of commerce must license all of our sales outside of north america 
we are also required to obtain licenses from that agency for sales of our saw products to customers in certain countries 
if we fail to obtain these licenses or experience delays in obtaining these licenses in the future  our results of operations could be harmed 
also  because a majority of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars  increases in the value of the dollar would increase the price in local currencies of our products and make our products less price competitive 
we may be subject to a securities class action suit if our stock price falls 
following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  some stockholders may file securities class action litigation 
for example  in  a stockholder class action lawsuit was filed against us  our underwriters and some of our officers  directors and investors  which alleged that we  our underwriters and certain of our officers  directors and investors intentionally misled the investing public regarding our financial prospects 
we settled the action and recorded a special charge of million associated with the settlement of this lawsuit and related legal expenses  net of accruals  in recently  in february  several nearly identical civil class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the middle district of florida against sawtek  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary since july the lawsuits also name as defendants current and former officers of sawtek and our company 
the class action complaints purportedly are filed on behalf of purchasers of sawtek s stock between january and may or may  all of the complaints allege that the defendants violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act  as well as securities and exchange commission rule b  by making false and misleading statements and or omissions to inflate sawtek s stock price and conceal the downward trend in revenues disclosed in sawtek s may  press release 
at least one complaint alleges a third cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty to the shareholders 
the complaints do not specify the amount of monetary damages sought 
we deny the allegations contained in these complaints and intend to defend against these claims vigorously 
this litigation may  however  require us to spend a substantial amount of time and money and could distract management from our day to day operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance as to our success in defending ourselves against these charges 
this and any future securities class action litigation could be expensive and divert our management s attention and harm our business  regardless of its merits 
our stock will likely be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control and may prevent our stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit 
the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of semiconductor companies have been especially volatile 
the market price of our common stock may experience significant fluctuations in the future 
for example  our common stock price has fluctuated from a high of approximately to a low of approximately during the weeks ended december  this market volatility  as well as general economic  market or political conditions could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in response  the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include anti takeover provisions  which may deter or prevent a takeover attempt 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt  including a takeover that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock 
these provisions include cumulative voting 
our stockholders are entitled to cumulate their votes for directors 
this may limit the ability of the stockholders to remove a director other than for cause 
stockholder proposals and nominations 
our stockholders must give advance notice  generally days prior to the relevant meeting  to nominate a candidate for director or present a proposal to our stockholders at a meeting 
these notice requirements could inhibit a takeover by delaying stockholder action 
stockholder rights plan 
we may trigger our stockholder rights plan in the event our board of directors does not agree to an acquisition proposal 
the rights plan may make it more difficult and costly to acquire our company 
preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to determine what rights  preferences and privileges such shares have 
no action by our stockholders is necessary before our board of directors can issue the preferred stock 
our board of directors could use the preferred stock to make it more difficult and costly to acquire our company 
delaware anti takeover statute 
the delaware anti takeover law restricts business combinations with some stockholders once the stockholder acquires or more of our common stock 
the delaware statute makes it harder for our company to be acquired without the consent of our board of directors and management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash equivalents  short term and long term investments our investments in cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  both restricted and unrestricted  are classified as available for sale securities and are comprised of highly rated  short and medium term investments  such as u 
s 
government agencies  corporate debt securities and other such low risk investments  in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
classified as available for sale  all of these investments are held at fair value 
although we manage investments under an investment policy  economic  market and other events may occur  which we cannot control 
although the risks are minimal  fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely impacted because of changes in interest rates and credit ratings 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer principal losses if we were to sell securities that have declined in value because of changes in interest rates or issuer credit ratings 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading speculative purposes 
we do not believe that our results operations would be materially impacted by an immediate percent change in interest rates 
debt our convertible subordinated notes due have a fixed interest rate of 
consequently  we do not have significant interest rate cash flow exposure on our long term debt 
however  the fair value of the convertible subordinated notes is subject to significant fluctuations due to their convertibility into shares of our stock and other market conditions 
the fair value of these convertible subordinated notes is also sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of the us interest rates 
we would be exposed to interest rate risk  if we used additional financing to fund capital expenditures 
the interest rate that we may be able to obtain on financings will depend on market conditions at that time and may differ from the rates we have secured in the past 
the following table shows the fair values of our investments and convertible subordinated notes as of december  in thousands cost fair value cash and cash equivalents   available for sale investments including unrealized gains of convertible subordinated notes   foreign currency risk we are exposed to currency exchange fluctuations  as we sell our products internationally and have operations in costa rica  germany and mexico 
we have also recently completed the establishment of an operation in china 
we manage the sensitivity of our international sales  purchases of raw materials and equipment and our costa rican operations by denominating most transactions in us dollars 
we do engage in limited foreign currency hedging transactions  principally to lock in the cost of purchase commitments that are not denominated in us dollars 
at december   we had no open commitments to purchase foreign currency
