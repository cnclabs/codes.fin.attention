item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our revenues are generated from two primary sources o company restaurant sales food and beverage sales o franchise income franchise income consists of franchise restaurant royalties generally of each franchise restaurant s monthly gross sales and franchise fees which typically range from  to  for each applebee s restaurant opened 
beverage sales include sales of alcoholic beverages  while non alcoholic beverages are included in food sales 
certain expenses relate only to company operated restaurants 
these include o food and beverage costs o labor costs o direct and occupancy costs o pre opening expenses other expenses  such as general and administrative and amortization expenses  relate to both company operated restaurants and franchise operations 
we operate on a or week fiscal year ending on the last sunday in december 
our fiscal years ended december   december  and december  contained  and weeks  respectively  and are referred to hereafter as  and  respectively 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgement or complexity see note of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
franchise income franchise income consists of franchise royalties and franchise fees 
we recognize royalties on a franchisee s sales in the period in which the sales occur 
we also receive a franchise fee for each restaurant that a franchisee opens 
franchise fees are deferred until we have performed substantially all of our related obligations as franchisor  typically when the restaurant opens 
property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the useful lives of the assets are based upon management s expectations 
we periodically review the assets for changes in circumstances which may impact their useful lives 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically review property and equipment for impairment using historical cash flows as well as current estimates of future cash flows and or appraisals 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions which are subject to a significant degree of judgement 
in addition  we periodically assess the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires us to make assumptions regarding the future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the assets 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
legal and insurance reserves we are periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
we are required to assess the probability of any adverse judgements as well as the potential range of loss 
we determine the required accruals after a review of the facts of each legal action 
we use estimates in the determination of the appropriate liabilities for general liability  workers compensation and health insurance 
the estimated liability is established based upon historical claims data and third party actuarial estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims 
unanticipated changes in these factors may require us to revise our estimates 
employee incentive compensation plans we have various long term employee incentive compensation plans which require us to make estimates to determine our liability based upon projected performance of plan criteria 
if actual performance against the criteria differs from our estimates in the future  we will be required to adjust our liability accordingly 
receivables we continually assess the collectibility of our franchise receivables 
we establish our allowance for bad debts based on several factors  including historical collection experience  the current economic environment and other specific information available to us at the time 
the allowance for bad debts may change in the future due to changes in the factors above or other new developments 
we periodically reassess our assumptions and judgements and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
a change in any of the above estimates could impact our consolidated statements of earnings and the related asset or liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheets would be adjusted accordingly 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates that are described above

income taxes 
the effective income tax rate  as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  was in both and liquidity and capital resources our need for capital historically has resulted from the construction and acquisition of restaurants  investment in information technology systems and the repurchase of our common shares 
in the past  we have obtained capital through public stock offerings  debt financing  and our ongoing operations 
cash flows from our ongoing operations include cash generated from company and franchise operations  credit from trade suppliers  real estate lease financing  and landlord contributions to leasehold improvements 
we have also used our common stock as consideration in the acquisition of restaurants 
in addition  we have assumed debt or issued new debt in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions 
capital expenditures increased from  in to  in excluding  related to the acquisition of restaurants in the washington  dc area due primarily to expenditures related to the enhancement of our information systems 
we currently expect to open approximately company restaurants  and capital expenditures excluding acquisitions are expected to be between  and  in these expenditures will primarily be for the development of new restaurants  refurbishment and capital replacement for existing restaurants  and the enhancement of information systems 
because we expect to continue to purchase a portion of our sites  the amount of actual capital expenditures will be dependent upon  among other things  the proportion of leased versus owned properties 
in addition  if we open more restaurants than we currently anticipate or acquire additional restaurants  our capital requirements will increase accordingly 
on november   we acquired the operations and assets of applebee s restaurants located in the washington  dc area from a franchisee 
under the terms of the purchase agreement and the agreement with the franchisee s secured lender  the total purchase price of the acquisition was  the agreement also provides for additional consideration in july if the restaurants achieve cash flows in excess of historical levels 
our financial statements reflect the results of operations for these restaurants subsequent to the date of acquisition 
on january   we reached an agreement with a franchisee to acquire the operations and assets of applebee s restaurants located in illinois  indiana  kentucky and missouri for  in cash at closing  subject to adjustment 
the acquisition of the restaurants is anticipated to close late in the first quarter of  subject to obtaining operating licenses and other third party consents 
our bank credit agreement provides for a  three year unsecured revolving credit facility  of which  may be used for the issuance of letters of credit 
the facility is subject to various covenants and restrictions which  among other things  require the maintenance of stipulated fixed charge  leverage and indebtedness to capitalization ratios  as defined  and limit additional indebtedness and capital expenditures in excess of specified amounts 
cash dividends are limited to  annually 
the facility is subject to standard other terms  conditions  covenants  and fees 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit agreement 
as of december   we had borrowings of  and standby letters of credit of  outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we also had a standby letter of credit for  outstanding with another financial institution 
in february  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  of our common stock through  subject to market conditions and applicable restrictions imposed by our then current credit agreement 
as of december   we had  remaining on this authorization 
in february  our board of directors extended the authorization through in may  our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of  of our common stock through may during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of for an aggregate cost of  as of december   we had  remaining under the authorization 
as of december   our liquid assets totaled  these assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents in the amount of  and short term investments in the amount of  the working capital deficit increased from  as of december  to  as of december  this increase was due primarily to decreases in cash and cash equivalents due to payments on long term debt  the acquisition of restaurants in the washington  dc area and an increase in accrued compensation and gift certificate liabilities 
on september   we formed neighborhood insurance  inc  a vermont corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary  as a captive insurance company 
neighborhood insurance  inc was established to provide applebee s international  inc and certain franchisees with workers compensation and general liability insurance 
applebee s international  inc and covered franchisees will make premium payments to the captive insurance company which will pay administrative fees and insurance claims  subject to individual and aggregate maximum claim limits under the captive insurance company s reinsurance policies 
as a result  our cash and cash equivalents and accrued liabilities may increase in future periods due to the operation of the captive insurance company 
we believe that our liquid assets and cash generated from operations  combined with borrowings available under our credit facilities  will provide sufficient funds for our operating  capital and other requirements for the foreseeable future 
the following table shows our debt amortization schedule  our future capital lease commitments including principal and interest payments and our future operating lease commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period certain less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt excluding capital lease obligations   capital lease obligations     operating leases      in addition  we have outstanding lease guarantees of approximately  as of december  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
in particular  increases in food  supplies  labor and operating expenses could have a significant impact on our operating results 
we do not believe that inflation has materially affected our operating results during the past three years 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
the federal government continues to consider an increase in the minimum wage 
several state governments have increased the minimum wage and other state governments are also considering an increased minimum wage 
in the past  we have been able to pass along cost increases to customers through food and beverage price increases  and we will attempt to do so in the future 
we cannot guarantee  however  that all future cost increases can be reflected in our prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without at least somewhat diminishing customer spending in our restaurants 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and requires separate recognition of intangible assets that meet certain criteria 
this statement applies to all business combinations after june  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and we adopted this statement effective december  sfas no 
requires that an intangible asset that is acquired shall be initially recognized and measured based on its fair value 
this statement also provides that goodwill should not be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the first step of the required two step goodwill impairment testing and ceased amortization of goodwill 
the first step of the impairment test required us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value to determine whether there was an indication that an impairment existed 
if there had been an indication of impairment  we would have allocated the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
during  no impairment losses were recorded under sfas no 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no

rescinds this requirement and stipulates that gains or losses on extinguishment of debt would have to meet the criteria of apb opinion no 
to be classified as an extraordinary item 
in addition  any extraordinary gains or losses on extinguishment of debt in prior periods presented would require reclassification 
sfas no 
is required  with early adoption encouraged  for fiscal years beginning after may  we early adopted sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and as a result  we reclassified the  net of a related tax benefit of  extraordinary loss from the extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of earnings to other expense and income taxes 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized only when the liability is incurred and measured at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the initial adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
interpretation no 
supersedes interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  and provides guidance to guarantors on the recognition and disclosure concerning obligations under certain guarantees in interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of interpretation no 
are effective for guarantees issued or modified after december   and are to be applied prospectively 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december  we adopted the initial recognition provisions of interpretation no 
in january of the disclosure provisions of this interpretation are effective for us as of december  the initial adoption of interpretation no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
this statement also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure in annual and interim financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions of this statement are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
forward looking statements the statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section regarding restaurant development  capital expenditures and financial commitments are forward looking and based on current expectations 
there are several risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described 
these risks include but are not limited to our ability and the ability of our franchisees to open and operate additional restaurants profitably  the continued growth of our franchisees and our ability to attract and retain qualified franchisees  the impact of intense competition in the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry and our ability to control restaurant operating costs which are impacted by market changes  minimum wage and other employment laws  food costs and inflation 
for a more detailed discussion of the principal factors that could cause actual results to be materially different  you should read our current report on form k which we filed with the securities and exchange commission on february  we disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
our revolving credit facility bears interest at either the bank s prime rate or libor plus  at our option 
as of december   the total amount of debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was  which was outstanding on our revolving credit facility 
a change in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of  per year 
we may from time to time enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our earnings 
many of the food products we purchase are subject to price volatility due to factors that are outside of our control such as weather and seasonality 
as part of our strategy to moderate this volatility  we have entered into fixed price purchase commitments with terms of one year or less
