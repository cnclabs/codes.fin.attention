requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of norstan s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of deferred tax assets and valuation of accounts receivable 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by norstan which require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the company considers these to be critical and could result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
revenue recognition 
norstan s principal sources of revenues are derived from the sale  installation and service of its full range of voice and data technologies and services 
within the communications technology solutions and services segment  revenues from the sale and installation of products and systems are generally recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting for long term contracts and revenues from maintenance service contracts  moves  adds  and changes  and network integration services  are recognized as the services are provided 
service contracts are generally pre billed either on a quarterly or annual basis and any prepayments are reflected on the balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the service period on a straight line basis 
resale services revenues generated from the secondary equipment market are recognized upon performance of contractual obligations  which is generally upon shipment 
financial services revenues are recognized over the life of the related lease receivables using the effective interest method 
if norstan does not accurately estimate the resources required and the scope of work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under its customer contracts  then future margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to the company s financial condition and results of operations and would be reflected in the period in which they were identified 

table of contents valuation of deferred tax assets 
norstan recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
norstan regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes valuation allowances based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established in a given period  an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations is recorded 
conversely  when a valuation allowance is reduced  a tax benefit is recorded in the statement of operations 
as of april   the company had provided for valuation allowances for the company s capital loss carryforward which was due to expire in fiscal  and the company s canadian net operating loss carryforwards which expire through fiscal during fiscal  norstan reversed a portion of these valuation allowances and recorded a tax benefit of million and million relating to the capital loss and canadian net operating loss carryforwards  respectively 
the reversal of these valuation allowances was due to the capital gain generated from the sale of the company s network services business and the fiscal canadian taxable income as well as the company s estimates of future canadian earnings 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  norstan reversed the valuation allowance related to its us net operating loss carryforward and recorded a tax benefit of million 
the reversal of this allowance was mainly due to the recently enacted us federal five year net operating loss carryback rules resulting in a million federal tax refund which was received in june  fiscal taxable income and the company s estimates of future operating earnings 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or that these estimates are adjusted in future periods or if uncertainties arise related to the company s ability to utilize some or all of the deferred tax assets  the company may need to establish additional valuation allowances which could materially impact its financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of accounts receivable 
norstan performs credit checks on all new contract customers with orders greater than  credit limits are assessed according to current creditworthiness including  but not limited to  the customer s current financial condition  working capital and payment histories 
collection activity for service contract customers is performed on an ongoing basis with payments due quarterly in advance of service commencement 
norstan enforces a service hold policy if a customer is in default of its payment obligation and has provided no immediate commitment to pay 
bad debt reserves are established and continuously evaluated based on customer collections and payments  historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that may have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within norstan s expectations and the provisions established  management cannot guarantee that the company will continue to have similar experience 
in addition  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of the company s customers or any adverse change in general economic conditions could have a material impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  norstan reported a pre tax loss from continuing operations of  as compared to a pre tax loss of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  during fiscal  the company reported net income and gains from discontinued operations of million as compared to  in fiscal and a net loss and loss on disposal from discontinued operations of million in fiscal as a result  the company has been able to significantly reduce its long term bank debt as well as finance strategic investments in expanding geographic reach  implementing services sales initiatives and adding customer retention specialists 
based on these positive developments and the company s operating plans for fiscal  management believes that cash flows generated by operations  borrowing capacity available under the financing arrangements discussed below  and cash received from capital lease financing or other transactions  including the issuance of debt or equity securities  will be sufficient to meet its cash flow needs through at least april  however  there can be no assurance 
table of contents that the assumptions used by management in formulating its assessment will prove accurate 
in the event that the company requires supplemental sources of capital  there can be no assurance as to their availability on terms acceptable to the company 
cash flows 
continuing operations provided net cash of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
net income loss from continuing operations was a loss of  in fiscal as compared to net income of million and a net loss of million in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  a significant reduction in accrued liabilities  mainly bonuses accrued at the end of fiscal and paid in fiscal  was offset by the receipt of a million federal tax refund which was recorded at the end of fiscal and collected in fiscal net cash of million was provided by investing activities in fiscal  a decrease of over million from fiscal this decrease was mainly the result of the winding down of norstan s leasing activity which led to a significant reduction in proceeds from lease contracts between fiscal and financing activities utilized net cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the high level of cash used for financing activities in each of the fiscal years  and was due to repayment of bank debt and discounted lease rentals
