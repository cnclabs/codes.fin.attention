item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations k is a premier  branded consumer products company with a primary focus on sporting goods and other recreational products as well as certain niche industrial products 
the sporting goods segment represents million  or  of k s consolidated net sales  and other recreational products represent million  or in net sales 
industrial products had sales of million  or of net sales in on march   k completed the acquisition of rawlings sporting goods company  inc rawlings  a designer  manufacturer and marketer of equipment and apparel for baseball  basketball and football  in an all stock merger transaction 
under the terms of the merger  each share of rawlings common stock was converted into shares of common stock of k based on the number of common shares outstanding of rawlings  approximately million shares of k s common stock were issued to the rawlings shareholders  and the purchase price of the transaction was valued at approximately million and the assumption of long term and seasonal working capital debt 
this transaction will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  accordingly the purchased assets and liabilities will be recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the preliminary purchase price allocation is estimated to result in an excess of cost over net tangible assets acquired  to be determined during april based on k s final evaluation of the net tangible assets 
this preliminary allocation assumes the excess purchase price will be allocated to goodwill  and is thus not amortized  however the final allocation could include identifiable intangible assets with finite and indefinite lives separate from goodwill 
should there be assets with finite lives  those assets would be subject to amortization resulting in additional amortization expense 
the final allocation of the purchase price will also be completed during april based on k s final evaluation of such assets and liabilities 
the results of the operations of rawlings will be included in the consolidated financial statements of k beginning with the date of acquisition 
during  k began to reduce the cost structure of its ski and snowboard operations by restructuring and downsizing its washington ski manufacturing operation in favor of lower cost manufacturing and sourcing opportunities 
during  in ongoing cost reduction moves  k completed the move of its remaining ski production to china  closing the washington ski manufacturing facility during in addition  three other smaller manufacturing facilities  which serviced the stearns and hilton operations were shut down in minnesota and alabama  with most of the production also moving overseas 
in addition to the factory closures  k experienced a substantial industry wide slowdown of sales of small wheeled products in  necessitating a downsizing of k s small wheeled products operations 
consequently  the factory closures and downsizing activities resulted in charges to cost of products sold and general and administrative expenses for restructuring and downsizing costs of million and million  respectively 
approximately million of the total amount was a charge to earnings that resulted in or will result in a cash payment 
these costs are associated with the reduction of personnel  the write down of facilities and equipment  and the reduction in the net carrying value of small wheeled products inventory 
certain amounts included in prior years net sales and selling expenses have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for details 
the following discussion reflects the effects of such changes 
unless stated otherwise  all per share calculations refer to shares of common stock 
review of operations comparison of to net sales declined to million from million in the prior year 
net income for was million  or 
per diluted share  as compared to a net loss of million  or 
per diluted share  in the prior year 
the net loss for included million  or 
per diluted share  in after tax charges for restructuring and downsizing 
net sales 
in the sporting goods segment  net sales for totaled million as compared with million in the overall decline in sales was attributable to worldwide declines in snowboard and in line skates sales of and million  respectively 
these declines were partially offset by increased worldwide sales of shakespeare fishing tackle of million  stearns outdoor products of million and skis of million 
the decline in snowboard sales was due to cautious ordering by retailers in the soft economy  despite growing market shares of both k ride snowboard products 
orders for in line skates  declined as retail inventories were reduced following a sharp decline in the worldwide in line skate market 
k s position in the market has benefited from its brand  its strength as the performance skate leader coupled with the benefits of a market consolidating around a handful of brands 
shakespeare fishing tackle sales benefited from market share gains  led by higher sales of new fishing reels  ugly stik fishing rods  and kits and combos 
higher sales of stearns outdoor products were the result of the increased popularity of children s flotation devices and new applications for the us navy 
the improvement in ski sales was due to growing market shares in the us and strong sell through of k products at retail 
in the other recreational products segment  net sales for were million as compared with million in the prior year 
the growth in adio skateboard shoes of million only partially offset the decline in sales of corporate apparel in continued sluggish market conditions 
in the industrial products group  net sales for were million as compared with million in the sales decline reflected reduced sales of marine antennas of million and monofilaments sold to the paperweaving industry of million  partially offset by increased sales of cutting line of million 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year was million  or of net sales in  as compared with million  or of net sales in gross profit for included charges for restructuring and downsizing of million a discussion regarding an additional million which was charged against general and administrative expenses is included below 
during  k closed the washington ski manufacturing facility and three other smaller manufacturing facilities in minnesota and alabama which serviced the stearns and hilton operations  with most of the production moving to china and elsewhere 
in addition to the factory closures  k experienced an industry wide slowdown in sales of small wheeled products  necessitating a downsizing of k s small wheeled products operation 
the downsizing of the small wheeled products business  the shutdown of the domestic manufacturing facilities and additional cost reduction measures resulted in charges to cost of products sold of million primarily related to severance  the write down of facilities and equipment  and the reduction in the net carrying value of small wheeled products inventory 
the overall improvement in gross profit dollars and margins for was attributable to the restructuring and downsizing charges discussed above and reduced product costs obtained from selling products manufactured in china 
these improvements were more than offset by a million adjustment in to the carrying value of the scooter inventory  and higher sales of reduced margin products  particularly in line skates in europe  in conjunction with k s inventory reduction initiatives 
k s inventory reduction initiatives helped to reduce overall inventory levels by million from the prior year 
costs and expenses 
selling expenses decreased to million  or of net sales as compared with million  or of net sales  in the dollar and percentage decline was attributable to the decline in sales volume in and k s cost reduction programs initiated during general and administrative expenses for were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in expenses for included downsizing charges of million  primarily for severance and the write down of facilities associated with the downsizing of the small wheeled products operation 
the dollar and percentage increase in was attributable to additional allowances recorded for doubtful accounts of million  higher insurance costs of million  severance expense related to the former ceo of million and higher pension costs of million 
research and development expenses declined to million from million in as the result of k s cost reduction initiatives 
beginning in the first quarter  in accordance with k s adoption of new accounting pronouncements  amortization expense of goodwill is no longer being recorded against earnings 
this resulted in reduction of general and administrative expenses of approximately million during the current year as compared to operating income 
operating income for improved to million from million  or of net sales  as compared to operating income of million  or of net sales  in the period included million of restructuring and downsizing charges as discussed above 
the improvement in earnings for the period reflects the impact of the restructuring and downsizing charges  lower selling expenses of million and lower research and development expenses of million partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense declined million  or  to million in lower average borrowings resulted in interest savings of million and lower average interest rates resulted in an additional million of savings  the average interest rate decrease was due to general interest rates declines that occurred during and a higher percentage of borrowings under k s accounts receivable purchase facility during rather than under to k s other long term liquidity facilities which have higher interest rates 
other income 
other income  which includes royalties  interest income and other miscellaneous income  declined to million from million in income taxes 
the effective income tax rate for increased to an expected rate of as the result of the income from operations versus the credit in the prior year as the result of the loss from continuing operations 
segment information 
total segment operating profit before interest expense  corporate expenses and income taxes improved to million from million in the period included million of restructuring and downsizing charges as discussed above of which million was reflected in the sporting goods segment  million in the other recreational products segment and million in the industrial products segment 
in the sporting goods segment  operating profit was million as compared with an operating loss of million in the current year improvement was attributable to the restructuring and downsizing costs discussed above and lower selling and research and development expenses as the result of k s cost reduction initiatives 
these improvements were partially offset by increased insurance costs  higher allowances for doubtful accounts and a million adjustment to the carrying value of the scooter inventory 
in the other recreational products segment  an operating loss of million was reported in as compared with an operating loss of million in the increase in the loss was attributable to the decline in corporate apparel sales due to continued sluggish market conditions and lower gross margins as the result of k s inventory reduction efforts 
in the industrial products segment  operating profit declined to million from million in the decline was due to lower gross margins as the result of k s inventory reduction efforts and sluggishness in the industry as well as higher insurance costs and allowances for doubtful accounts 
review of operations comparison of to net sales declined to million from million in the prior year 
the net loss for was million  or 
per diluted share  as compared to net income of million  or 
per diluted share  in the prior year 
the net loss for included million  or 
per diluted share  in after tax charges for restructuring and downsizing 
net sales 
in the sporting goods segment  net sales for totaled million as compared with million in the overall decline in sales was attributable to a million decline in scooter sales  primarily in the european market  and a reduction in worldwide in line skate sales of million 
the scooter market experienced explosive growth in  however  orders for scooters abruptly stopped early in the first quarter 
orders for in line skates began to decline in the second quarter in response to higher than expected retail inventory levels 
orders for in line skates remained soft throughout the remainder of the year  however  the rate of decline diminished by the fourth quarter as retail inventory levels improved 
partially offsetting these declines were increases in sales of k skis of million  stearns outdoor products of million  and domestic shakespeare fishing tackle products of million 
sales of k skis improved in despite historically low reorder sales caused by the economy and poor snow conditions  reflecting gains in market shares in the north american market fueled by the success of the ski line that featured mod technology 
fishing tackle sales improved  led by the growth of reels  kits and combos and accessories reflecting new product introductions and increased market share 
sales of stearns products improved due to higher sales of drywear  industrial and cordage products 
partially offsetting these increases was a modest decline in snowboard sales due to the sluggish economy and poor snow conditions 
in the other recreational products segment  net sales for were million as compared with million in the prior year 
the growth in skateboard shoes  particularly the adio and hawk brands  partially offset the recession related decline of sales in the corporate casuals business 
in the industrial products group  net sales declined to million from million in the sales decline reflected soft demand for paperweaving monofilaments  composite light poles and marine antennas 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year was million  or of net sales in  as compared with million  or of net sales in gross profit for included charges for restructuring and downsizing of million a discussion regarding an additional million which was charged against general and administrative expenses is included below 
during  k closed the washington ski manufacturing facility and three other smaller manufacturing facilities in minnesota and alabama  which serviced the stearns and hilton operations  with most of the production moving to china and elsewhere 
in addition to the factory closures  k experienced an industry wide slowdown in sales of small wheeled products  necessitating a downsizing of k s small wheeled products operation 
the downsizing of the small wheeled products business  the shutdown of the domestic manufacturing facilities and additional cost reduction measures resulted in charges to cost of products sold of million primarily related to severance  the write down of facilities and equipment  and the reduction in the net carrying value of small wheeled products inventory 
the decline in gross profit dollars and margins for was attributable to the restructuring and downsizing charges discussed above  higher sales of reduced margin products  including close out sales of in line skates in europe  and an increase in the percentage of sales of lower margin goods 
this decline was partially offset by reduced product costs obtained from selling products manufactured in china 
costs and expenses 
selling expenses decreased to million  or of net sales as compared with million  or of net sales  in the increase as a percentage of sales reflects the decline in sales volume for  without a corresponding decrease in expenses 
expenses did not decline at a corresponding rate due to the initiation of certain sales and marketing programs early in  before there was indication of a market contraction in small wheeled products 
general and administrative expenses for were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in expenses for included downsizing charges of million  primarily for severance and the write down of facilities associated with the downsizing of the small wheeled products operation 
the increase in expenses as a percentage of sales was attributable to the downsizing charges discussed above  partially offset by cost reduction measures initiated during research and development expenses declined to million from million in operating income 
operating income was million  or of net sales  as compared to operating income of million  or of net sales  in the decrease in earnings for the period was attributable to the million of restructuring and downsizing charges discussed above  and to a decline in small wheeled products sales and earnings  partially offset by improved operating results for skis  snowboards  bikes  fishing tackle and stearns outdoor products  and decreased selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense declined million to million in lower average borrowings resulted in interest savings of million  which was offset by million of additional interest as the result of higher average interest rates 
the average interest rate increase was due to lesser receivables sold under the accounts receivable purchase facility in  which has lower average interest rates than k s other long term liquidity facilities and an increase in borrowing costs beginning in the fourth quarter 
other income 
other income  which includes royalties  interest income and other miscellaneous income  increased to 
million from 
million in income taxes 
the income tax rate for decreased due to the tax benefit recognized in from the recording of carrybacks and benefits from carryforward of tax losses in the united states and germany 
segment information 
total segment operating profit before interest expense  corporate expenses and income taxes declined to million from million in in the sporting goods segment  operating loss was million as compared with an operating profit of million in the current year decline was attributable to million of restructuring and downsizing costs discussed above  and an overall decline in sales and margins of small wheeled products as compared to the prior year 
in the other recreational products segment  an operating loss of million was reported in as compared with an operating loss of million in the increase in the loss was attributable to million of restructuring costs associated with plant closures in  and the decline in corporate apparel sales due to continued sluggish market conditions 
this decline was partially offset by improved sales volume of skateboard shoes and apparel 
in the industrial products segment  operating profit declined to million from million in the decline was due to reduced sales volume of monofilament line used in the paper industry  marine antennas and composite light poles 
liquidity and sources of capital k s operating activities provided million of cash in the current year as compared to million provided by k s operating activities during at december   k had a million accounts receivable purchase facility purchase facility  that was placed in effect in march replacing an asset securitization program 
the prior asset securitization program was accounted for as a sale of accounts receivable and accordingly  received off balance sheet treatment 
the current purchase facility is treated as a borrowing under long term debt 
as a result  the cash used in operating activities in the current year includes million used to repurchase the receivables under the prior asset securitization program  funded by borrowings under the purchase facility included in financing activities and other cash flow provided by operations 
cash from operating activities benefited from higher net income  reductions in accounts receivable and inventories  and an increase in accrued liabilities 
in march  k completed amendments to its credit facilities and notes 
pursuant to the amendments  k granted security interests to the lenders under the credit line and the notes in substantially all of its assets  except for certain domestic trade accounts receivable  which are utilized in the purchase facility as discussed above 
because of the amendments  there have been modifications to certain financial covenants 
in march  k refinanced its credit line  purchase facility and senior notes by entering a three year million revolving credit facility the facility with several banks and other financial institutions  as discussed below 
net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was million  as compared to million in the decrease in cash used in was due to lower capital expenditures of million and due to the purchase of the assets of an industrial business for million in cash 
no material commitments for capital expenditures existed at year end 
cash used in financing activities was million as compared with cash provided of million in the cash used in financing activities as compared to cash provided in the prior year was due to the overall increase in cash provided from operations and the decrease in cash used in investing activities 
these improvements resulted in net repayments of long term debt in  partially offset by borrowings under the purchase facility  as compared to net borrowings during at december   k s principal long term borrowing facility  as amended during see discussion above  was a million credit line the credit line  secured by certain of the assets of k the principal under the credit line was due on december  additionally  k had a million accounts receivable purchase facility purchase facility which was due on march  a discussion of the refinancing of the credit line and purchase facility below 
at december   although there were no borrowings  there were million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit line  with an additional million available for borrowings  subject to certain covenants 
at december   there were million of borrowings outstanding under the purchase facility  with an additional million available for borrowings pursuant to the terms of the facility 
k also had million of secured senior notes due through  payable in two remaining equal principal payments  and million of secured notes due through  payable in seven equal principal payments commencing in senior notes 
at december   k had million outstanding under foreign lines of credit 
the credit facilities limit k s ability to pay cash dividends and make stock repurchases 
as of december   million of retained earnings were free of such restrictions 
the following summarizes the outstanding borrowings and long term contractual obligations of k at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
contractual obligations total less than year years years after years thousands long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations on february  k completed a transaction with k ventures ltd  a singapore based investment company  in which k sold million of convertible subordinated debentures due march the debentures are initially convertible into  shares of k common stock at per share 
pursuant to the agreement  k ventures also received warrants to purchase  additional shares of k s common stock at per share  exercisable within five years 
the proceeds from the sale were used to pay down a portion of k s senior notes outstanding 
on march   k refinanced its credit line  purchase facility and senior notes by entering the facility as discussed above 
the facility is expandable to million subject to certain conditions 
the facility has a million limit for the issuance of letters of credit 
borrowings under the facility are secured by substantially all of k s assets 
actual borrowing availability under the facility is based on k s trade receivable and inventory levels in the united states  canada and england  subject to eligibility criteria and defined advance rates 
borrowings under the facility bear an initial interest rate at a rate equal to the prime rate plus  or a libor interest rate plus  and the facility has an unused commitment fee of per year 
in addition to the facility  k also obtained a three year million term loan from certain banks participating in the facility bearing interest at an initial rate equal to the libor rate plus per annum  payable in equal monthly installments over the three year period 
the facility and term loan include various covenants  including requirements that k maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio and tangible net worth  as well as limiting annual capital expenditures and certain investment activities 
the proceeds of the facility were used to pay off the outstanding borrowings under the purchase facility  the remaining balances outstanding under the senior notes  and to securitize outstanding standby and trade letters of credit under the credit line through their original maturity dates 
in conjunction with the refinancing  k will expense approximately million million  or 
per diluted share  after tax in the first quarter of capitalized debt costs related to the credit line  purchase facility and senior notes  an additional million will be paid in cash and expensed million  or 
per diluted share  after tax for a make whole premium related to the prepayment of the senior notes 
k believes that the credit availability under the facility  together with cash flows from operations and the sale of the convertible subordinated debentures in february will be sufficient for k s business needs during k s ability to arrange debt financing from other sources  should such additional financing become necessary  could be limited by the fact that substantially all of k s assets  other than accounts receivable sold pursuant to the purchase facility  are subject to security interests pursuant to the facility 
for further information regarding k s borrowings  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters k is one of several named potentially responsible parties prp in three environmental protection agency matters involving discharge of hazardous materials at old waste sites in south carolina and michigan 
although environmental laws technically impose joint and several liability upon each prp at each site  the extent of k s required financial contribution to the cleanup of these sites is expected to be limited based upon the number and financial strength of the other named prps and the volume and types of waste involved which might be attributable to k environmental and related remediation costs are difficult to quantify for a number of reasons including the number of parties involved  the difficulty in determining the extent of the contamination  the length of time remediation may require  the complexity of environmental regulation and the continuing advancement of remediation technology 
k accrues for liabilities of this nature when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
at december  and  k had recorded an estimated liability of approximately  and  respectively  for environmental liabilities and made no provision for insurance recovery 
the estimates are based on k s share of the costs to remediate as provided by the prp s consultants and in ongoing discussions with the epa or other environmental agencies 
the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty  however  and taking into consideration reserves provided  management does not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on k s financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
newly adopted accounting standards effective january   k adopted new accounting standards on business combinations  and goodwill and other intangible assets 
the business combination changes require the use of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
the changes require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead reviewed at least annually for impairment  and more often when impairment indicators are present 
in addition  this new accounting standard includes provisions  upon adoption  for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
had k adopted the new goodwill accounting on the first day of  amortization expense for the year ended december  would have been lowered by approximately million  and the net loss for that period would have decreased by the same amount or 
per diluted share to million 
had k adopted the new goodwill accounting on the first day of  amortization expense for the year ended december  would have been reduced by approximately million  and the net income for that period would have increased by the same amount or 
per diluted share to million 
the adoption of this new standard resulted in an increase in operating income through a reduction of amortization expense of approximately million for the year ended december  in accordance with these new standards  while amortization of goodwill and assets with indefinite lives is no longer recorded  these accounts must be reviewed for impairment  at least annually  or when events indicate that an impairment exist 
k completed the impairment tests in the first quarter of and continues to review the accounts for impairment on an on going basis 
k estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using a discounted cash flow analysis 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement on financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
these new standards will be prospectively applied for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  if exit or disposal activities are initiated after that date  sfas no 
will affect the timing of the recognition of the related costs 
k does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
k will be required to follow the prescribed format and provide the additional disclosures required by sfas no 
in its financial statements for fiscal and must also provide the disclosures in the quarterly reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning with the quarterly period ending march  effective january   k adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on k s financial statements 
in and  the fasb emerging issues task force issued several changes to the accounting for incentives to customers resulting in k recording such items as deductions from sales rather than selling expense 
the impact of k s adoption of these changes on the financial statements was immaterial 
critical accounting policies k s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon k s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires k to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
discussed below are several significant accounting policies  which require the use of judgments and estimates that may materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
the estimates described below are reviewed from time to time and are subject to change if the circumstances so indicate 
the effect of any such change is reflected in results of operations for the period in which the change is made 
establishment of the reserves affecting inventories and the allowance for doubtful accounts are among the most important 
revenue recognition k recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment to its customers  net of reserves for estimated returns 
as a general matter  customers have no right of return  however returns do occur from time to time for a variety of reasons  including local business practices in one of the foreign countries in which k does business 
reserves for estimated returns are established based upon historical return rates and recorded as reductions of revenue 
warranty k records the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
k estimates warranty obligation by reference to historical product warranty return rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting the product 
should actual product warranty return rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the historical rates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
accounts receivable and allowances accounts receivable are the result of k s worldwide sales activities 
although k s credit risk is spread across a large number of customers within a wide geographic area  periodic concentrations within a specific industry occur due to the seasonality of its businesses 
at december  and  k s receivables from sporting goods retailers who sell skis  skates  snowboards and bikes  before giving consideration to receivables sold during the year  amounted to and  respectively  of total receivables 
k generally does not require collateral and performs periodic credit evaluations to manage its credit risk 
k evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where there is knowledge of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collected 
for all other customers  reserves are established based on historical bad debts  customer payment patterns and current economic conditions 
the establishment of these reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
if the financial condition of k s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required resulting in an additional charge to expenses when made 
during the year ended december   certain customers of k in the united states  europe and japan experienced financial deterioration resulting in an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
k records adjustments to its inventory for estimated obsolescence or diminution in market value equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  based on market conditions from time to time 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual experience if future economic conditions  levels of consumer demand  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
in  k recorded a total charge of approximately million  relating to the write down in the value of small wheeled products as the result of a significant softening of the market for such products during the year  and for inventory disposals resulting from the closure of certain manufacturing facilities and an additional million in income taxes income taxes are recorded using the liability method 
k estimates actual current tax exposure together with temporary differences that result from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
k then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is unlikely  a valuation allowance must be established 
a significant portion of k s deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards for both domestic and foreign purposes 
the realization of these assets is based upon estimates of future taxable income 
in those jurisdictions where the realization of these carryforwards is not likely  a valuation allowance has been established 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  additional income tax expense may be required 
pensions k sponsors several trusteed noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of its domestic employees 
pension costs and liabilities are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on assumptions related to the discount rate  projected compensation increases and expected return on assets 
k evaluates the assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments as necessary 
as of december   k s assumption related to the discount rate  projected compensation increases and expected return on assets was  and  respectively 
due to the declining stock market and interest rate environment in  k lowered its discount rate and expected return on assets assumptions to and  respectively  at december  a continued variance in the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase could have a significant impact on the pension costs recorded 
due to the declines in the stock market  actual asset returns on k s pension assets during the year did not meet k s assumption of expected returns 
this resulted in pension expense being higher than pension expense by approximately  which is reflected in the current year s general and administrative expenses 
for the year  market conditions remained unsteady which resulted in negative asset returns on the pension assets for the year 
these negative returns will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately million 
in addition  k anticipates there will be an additional reduction in the discount rate assumption  which will result in an additional increase to pension expense of approximately  finally  as a result of the declines in the pension asset values  k estimates a required cash contribution of approximately million to the pension plans in based on the negative asset returns realized during  the accumulated benefit obligation of the pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by million at december  these asset shortfalls resulted in k recording a non cash charge to other comprehensive income  a component of k s shareholder s equity  of million million  net of taxes 
based on this amount recorded  k had million of net long term pension liabilities as of december   consisting of million in asset shortfalls and an intangible asset for the unrecognized prior service cost of million 
foreign currency translation the functional currency for most foreign operations is the local currency 
the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been translated into united states dollars 
asset and liability accounts have been translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expense accounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the year 
the gains and losses associated with the translation of the financial statements resulting from the changes in exchange rates from year to year have been reported in the other comprehensive income or loss account in shareholders equity 
to the extent assets and liabilities of the foreign operations are realized or the foreign operations pay back intercompany debt  amounts previously reported in other comprehensive income or loss account would be included in net income or loss in the period in which the transaction occurs 
transaction gains or losses  other than those related to intercompany accounts and investments deemed to be of a long term nature  are included in net income or loss in the period in which they occur 
impact of inflation and changing prices the inflation rate  as measured by the consumer price index  has been relatively low in the last few years  and therefore  pricing decisions by k have largely been influenced by competitive market conditions 
depreciation expense is based on the historical cost to k of its fixed assets  and therefore  is considerably less than it would be if it were based on current replacement cost 
while buildings  machinery and equipment acquired in prior years will ultimately have to be replaced at significantly higher prices  it is expected this will be a gradual process over many years 
statement regarding forward looking disclosure this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these represent k s beliefs concerning future events  including  but not limited to  the following future sales and earnings  market trends for products sold by k  retail inventory levels  product acceptance and demand  growth efforts  cost reduction efforts  margin enhancement efforts  product development efforts  success of new product introductions  dependence on foreign manufacturing  foreign exchange fluctuations  future acquisitions and dispositions  successful integration of acquired businesses  debt reduction and overall market trends 
all such forward looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially by reason of a number of factors  many of which are outside of k s control 
among such factors are the following k s strategic plan involving growth through the acquisition of other companies may not succeed 
k s strategic plan involves rapid growth through the acquisition of other companies 
such growth involves a number of risks  including difficulties related to combining previously separate businesses into a single unit  the substantial diversion of management s attention from day to day operations  the assumption of liabilities of an acquired business including unforseen liabilities  the failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements  the risks of either highly leveraging or engaging in dilutive issuances of equity securities in order to fund the acquisitions  the potentially substantial transaction costs associated with acquisitions  and difficulties related to assimilating the products  personnel and systems of an acquired business 
current and future financings may place a significant debt burden on k draws on k s facility to accommodate the additional working capital requirements of rawlings and to fund future acquisitions  as well as potential future financings  may substantially increase k s current indebtedness 
among other things  such increased indebtedness could adversely affect k s ability to expand its business  market its products and make investments in capital expenditures  adversely affect the cost and availability of funds from commercial lenders  debt financing transactions and other sources  adversely affect the ability of k to pursue its acquisition strategy  and create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with lower debt levels 
financial conditions of customers 
a large portion of k sales are to sporting goods retailers 
many of k s smaller retailers and some larger retailers are not strongly capitalized 
adverse conditions in the sporting goods retail industry can adversely impact the ability of retailers to purchase k products  or could force retailers to insist upon credit terms that would involve significant risks of nonpayment 
international operations may seriously harm k s financial condition because of weak foreign economies and the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
k s revenue from international operations was approximately of total revenue for fiscal  and approximately of k s sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
k expects that revenues from its international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenues 
k s international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including recessions in foreign economies  currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations  limitations on repatriation of earnings  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  social  political and economic instability  the adoption and expansion of government trade restrictions  unfavorable political developments affecting international trade  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
reliance on overseas manufacturing 
the majority of k products are manufactured in china 
in the event of hostilities with iraq or north korea  disruptions of international trade or shipping could adversely affect the availability or cost of k products 
in addition  any disruption of relations between the united states and china could negatively affect the cost and availability of products manufactured in china 
acts of war or terrorism may have an adverse effect on k s business 
acts of war or terrorism may have an adverse effect on the economy generally  and more specifically on k s business 
among various other risks  such occurrences have the potential to significantly decrease consumer spending on leisure products and activities and or could adversely impact k s ability to consummate future debt or equity financings 
competitive developments and initiatives by k s competitors 
new product introductions  financial incentives to retailers  the affects of excess industry capacity and other initiatives by k competitors could weaken the market position of k products 
rapid changes in marketing strategies  product design  styles and tastes 
consumer demand for recreational products is strongly influenced by matters of taste and style 
k s success is dependent  in significant part  on its ability to keep abreast of  and lead  such changes 
weather 
sales of k s recreational products are strongly influenced by the weather 
poor snow conditions in the winter or summer conditions unfavorable to outdoor sports can adversely affect sales of important k products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect k s earnings and cash flows 
k manages its exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain firm purchase commitments and anticipated  but not yet committed purchases  by entering into some foreign currency forward contracts 
k s risk management objective is to reduce its exposure to the effects of changes in exchange rates on the cost of products sold over quarterly time horizons 
foreign currency exchange rate movements also affect k s competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors and may affect the profitability and pricing strategies of k as well 
k s foreign currency risk policies entail entering into foreign currency derivative instruments only to manage risk of currency fluctuations over a given period of time  not for speculative investments 
considering both the anticipated cash flows from firm purchase commitments and anticipated purchases for the next quarter and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year end  a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies would not materially adversely affect expected first quarter earnings or cash flows 
this analysis is dependent on actual purchases during the next quarter occurring within of budgeted forecasts 
the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
in addition  it is unlikely currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen
