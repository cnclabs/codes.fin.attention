the company has since expanded its analysis to consider psychographics such as fashion consciousness in the marketplace as well as local area market research 
the company has also retained a third party consulting firm to analyze each potential market 
finally  a committee of senior officers considers the collected data and analysis  and approves any potential new store location

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while the company believes that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that its estimates and assumptions will be accurate  which could require the company to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 
following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a first in first out basis  using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
the use of rim results in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail values of inventories 
based on a review of historical markdowns  current business trends and seasonal inventory categories  additional inventory reserves may be recorded to reflect estimated markdowns which may be required to liquidate certain inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management believes its inventory valuation methods approximate the net realizable value of clearance inventory and result in valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market 
long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors used in the review include management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the assets 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
insurance reserve estimates the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for various risks including workers compensation  general liability and associate related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by the covered employees 
the company is responsible for paying the claims that are under the insured limits 
the reserves recorded for these claims are estimated actuarially  based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
these reserve estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims filed and settled 
the estimated accruals for these reserves could be significantly affected if future claims differ from historical trends and other actuarial assumptions
