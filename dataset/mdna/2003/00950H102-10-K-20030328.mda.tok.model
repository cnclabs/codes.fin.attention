item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a global supplier of broadband fixed wireless access fwa equipment that allows communications service providers often referred to as local exchange carriers  or simply telephone companies  internet service providers often referred to as isps and other telecommunications users  such as enterprises  to cost effectively deliver high speed data and voice services using radio frequencies rather than wires 
we call this transmission method wireless broadband 
the market for our systems is a subset of the fixed wireless access systems market  which is the fixed point to multipoint market in radio frequencies below ghz 
our systems are based on a code division multiple access  or cdma  digital wireless technique  which provides wide area coverage  security and resistance to fading 
our systems can be deployed rapidly and cost effectively  providing an attractive alternative or complement to traditional copper wire  cable  or fiber optic communications access networks 
our products also include software tools that optimize geographic coverage of our systems and provide ongoing network management 
to facilitate the deployment and operation of our systems  we also offer network installation  training and support services 
during  we began shipping our products  which were among the first fixed point to multipoint wireless systems to be commercially deployed 
in october  we strengthened our position in the fwa equipment market with the acquisition of the wipll wireless internet protocol in the local loop business from marconi plc pursuant to a stock purchase agreement  and renamed the business airspan networks israel limited airspan israel 
the products and services produced by airspan israel enable operators in licensed and unlicensed wireless bands to offer high speed  low cost  wireless broadband connections for data and voice over ip 
we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock and debt of marconi wipll in exchange for million of cash 
we expect to continue to expand our business in certain areas through the acquisition of businesses  technologies  products  and or services from other businesses that may complement our product and service offerings 

table of contents our fwa systems the airspan fwa solutions have been installed by more than network operators in more than countries and are being tested by numerous other service providers 
we were originally organized in as a unit within dsc communications corporation  a telecommunications equipment manufacturer 
dsc began developing fixed wireless access systems in in january we created a new corporation that purchased the airspan unit from dsc for million  million of which was due in the form of debt payable over three years beginning february  and the balance through the issuance of million shares of preferred stock 
when alcatel acquired dsc in  we redeemed the preferred stock held by dsc for a cash payment of million 
in the first half of  we extinguished the debt owed to dsc by a payment of million  which gave rise to an extraordinary gain of million 
during february we moved to our own premises in uxbridge  uk in september we relocated our corporate head office to boca raton  florida 
our primary operations  manufacturing and product development centers remain in uxbridge  uk  and lod  israel 
we generated revenue of million in  million in and million in we have incurred net losses of million million and million for  and  respectively 
since becoming an independent company  we have generated significant net losses and negative cash flow and expect to continue to do so in we have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we generate revenue from sales of our systems including both hardware and software and from services related to implementation and support activities 
revenue from services has always been under of our total revenue 
our proprietary software is integral to our products and is not sold separately 
customer service contracts are generally of a short term nature  for days and weeks rather than months  and are sold separately from sales of our systems 
although service revenue does not currently constitute a material portion of our revenue  we believe that going forward  services will increase as a percentage of our revenue 
we recognize revenue pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 as amended by sab a and b revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenues are recognized when all of the following conditions are met an arrangement exists with the customer  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price for the product or service is fixed and determinable  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales  including sales to our distributors and resellers  is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
revenue is deferred when customer acceptance is required  rights of return exist  or other significant obligations remain that are essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
once these conditions have been satisfied  revenue is recognized 
the estimated cost of any post sale obligations  including basic product warranties  is accrued at the time revenue is recognized based on historical experience 
revenue from time and material service contracts is recognized once the services have been performed 
revenue from service contracts that relate to a period of cover is recognized ratably over the given contract period 
revenue is recognized on fixed price service contracts using the percentage of completion method unless we are not unable to make reasonable estimates under that method  in which case revenue is recognized on a completed contract basis 
in certain cases  we enter into agreements with customers whereby we are obligated to deliver multiple products and or multiple services multiple deliveries 
in these transactions  we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements based on their relative fair value 
revenue for these transactions is recognized on each element when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for that element 
we recognize revenue for delivered products and services only if i the above product revenue or service revenue criteria are 
table of contents met  ii undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  iii payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent upon delivery of the remaining products or services  and iv the fair value for each of the undelivered elements is known 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force and  to a lesser extent  through distribution channels 
we have direct sales offices in the us  us  australia  brazil  canada  china  czech republic  germany  indonesia  new zealand  the philippines  poland  russia  south africa and sri lanka 
we also sell through independent agents and resellers in markets where we do not have a direct sales presence and to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who may sell our products under their name 
our sales cycle is typically long and unpredictable and typically varies from one month to two years  often involving extensive testing and evaluation by prospective customers  which makes it difficult for us to anticipate the quarter in which particular sales may occur 
in  our non us sales accounted for of our total revenue 
of the us sales  consisted of systems sold to us customers that were shipped to destinations outside the us in  our top ten customers accounted for of our revenue 
in  our non us sales accounted for of our total revenue 
of the us sales  consisted of systems sold to us customers that were shipped to destinations outside the us in  our top ten customers accounted for of our revenue 
we currently derive  and expect to continue to derive  a substantial percentage of our revenue from fewer than ten customers 
in the year ended december   siemens telecommunications pty ltd 
in south africa and speednet inc in japan represented and respectively  of our revenue 
in the year ended december  there were no customers that individually accounted for more than ten percent of the year s revenue 
in the year ended december   suntel private ltd 
in sri lanka  eircom plc in ireland and telbeskid sp 
zo 
o in poland represented  and  respectively  of our revenue 
while we anticipate that our operating results will continue to depend on sales to a small number of key customers in the foreseeable future  we believe that the concentrated dependence will continue to lessen 
the following table identifies the percentage of our revenue by geographic region in the periods identified 
percentage of revenue geographic area year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  united states asia pacific europe africa and middle east south america cost of revenue consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  warranty costs  royalties  overhead related to manufacture of our products and customer support costs 
our gross margin is affected by changes in our product mix because our gross margin on base stations and related equipment is higher than the gross margin on subscriber terminals 
in addition  our gross margin is affected by changes in the average selling price of our systems  volume discounts granted to significant customers and the proportion of total revenue of sales of software  which typically carries a higher gross margin than hardware 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline and we intend to continue to implement product cost reductions  complete outsourcing of manufacturing and develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in an effort to maintain or increase our gross margins 
further  we expect to derive an increasing proportion of our revenue from the sale of our integrated systems through distribution channels 
revenue derived from these sales channels typically carries a lower gross margin than direct sales 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel and expenses for design  development and testing facilities and equipment 
these expenses also include costs associated with product development efforts  including consulting fees and prototyping costs from initial product concept to manufacture and production 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related costs for personnel  sales commissions  consulting fees and expenses for advertising  travel  technical assistance  trade shows  and promotional and demonstration materials 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures related to sales and marketing activities including 
table of contents costs associated with the recruitment of additional sales and marketing personnel and for the expansion of our distribution channels 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for personnel  professional and consulting fees and other related expenses and facilities costs 
during the third quarter of  in an effort to reduce our expenses to a level that supported our revised revenue expectations at the time  we reduced our then prevailing rates of period costs of revenue  research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
in the fourth quarter of our then prevailing rate of expenses for such items increased as a result of the acquisition of the wipll product line 
in  we expect that our research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses will remain broadly in line with levels of expenditure we experienced in the fourth quarter of we outsource most of our manufacturing processes for the as as products to solectron scotland ltd 
and  to a lesser extent  flextronics international 
we outsource most of the manufacturing for the wipll product to racamtech limited  part of the cam group of companies  in israel 
we expect to continue to use contract manufacturers 
we also purchase some of the key components of our products from single vendors for which alternative sources are generally not readily available 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  reserves for doubtful debt  excess or obsolete inventory  warranty costs  restructuring costs  the valuation goodwill  and legal proceedings 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may change as future events occur 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are dependant on significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition under our revenue recognition policy see note in the notes to the financial statements we are required to assess the credit worthiness of our customers 
we use our own judgment in assessing their credit worthiness  and the criteria by which each judgment is made may change in future periods and therefore may change future revenue recognition 
accounts receivable we are required to assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable balances 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
significant changes in required reserves have been recorded in recent periods to reflect our current judgment  and changes may occur in the future due to the market environment 

table of contents inventory we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
as a result  we exercise judgment as to the level of provisions required for excess and obsolete inventory 
these judgments are based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
should we decide in the future that actual market conditions have become less favorable  or our assumptions change due to changing market conditions  additional inventory provisions may be required 
warranty costs typically our products are covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
our estimate of costs required to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity  increased costs or our assessment of future conditions change  our warranty accrual will increase  which will result in decreased gross profit 
restructuring during and we recorded restructuring charges arising from our cost reduction programs 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee termination costs  the loss on subletting excess facilities  and the write down of assets to be disposed of as part of the restructuring 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from the amount of the reserves 
valuation of goodwill on january   fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  was implemented and as a result  we ceased to amortize our goodwill 
we were required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we performed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of the carrying value of goodwill was compared to its implied fair value by using the expected present value of future cash flows 
the result of this review was that no impairment of goodwill was recorded during the year ended december  in the impairment review  we make various assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of goodwill 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge that would adversely affect our results 
legal proceedings we are subject to class action complaints related to alleged false and misleading information in our registration statement and prospectus see item legal proceedings  and may also face litigation for labor and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to changes in circumstances within each case 

table of contents results of operations the following table provides operating data as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  revenue cost of revenue inventory provision gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing bad debt expense general and administrative acquired in process research and development and amortization of intangibles restructuring provision total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net income taxes net loss before extraordinary item extraordinary item gain on extinguishment of debt income tax charge gain after tax net loss restructuring in the third quarter of  the company implemented a restructuring program to reduce operating expenses and recorded a charge of million in relation to this program 
included in this charge were costs related to excess facilities and severance 
the company initially expected to sublease its excess facility space in sunrise  florida by the end of the first quarter of  but due to the continued economic slow down in the florida sublease market  a further thousand was recognized as restructuring in the income statement in the first quarter of on july  the lease was successfully assigned to a third party and all facility related restructuring charges were utilized by the end of the third quarter of in conjunction with the assignment of the lease we moved our headquarters to a smaller office at boca raton  florida 
the total number of employees terminated as part of the restructuring program was and all severance payments were made by the end of the third quarter in the third quarter of  a new restructuring program was initiated to further reduce our operating expenses 
a charge of million was recorded in the quarter 
included in this charge were costs related to the write off of tradeshow equipment and severance costs 
eighteen employees were terminated as part of this restructuring program in the fourth quarter of and another employee left the company in the first quarter of in the fourth quarter of the decision was made to complete outsourcing of the manufacturing activities then carried on in our riverside facility in uxbridge  uk as a result we recorded a million restructuring charge for the closure of this facility in all of this charge relates to the facility closure 

table of contents the restructuring charge and its utilization is summarized as follows balance at beginning of period restructuring charge utilized balance at end of period year ended december  facility related severance and other year ended december  facility related severance and other included in the third quarter facility restructuring charge was million for the write down of certain fixed assets  mainly furniture and fixtures 
these assets were disposed of as part of the lease assignment of our sunrise  florida head office 
included in the restructuring charge was thousand for the write down of certain fixed assets used at tradeshows and the riverside facility 
all charges  other than the fixed asset write downs  will result in direct cash outlays 
the realizable value of these assets has been estimated from the expected market price of similar assets 
we believe the restructurings described above will enable us to reduce our otherwise projected expenses and uses of cash for operations by approximately million in  including approximately million  million and million of cost reductions associated with sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative  respectively 
a vast majority of the cost reductions are associated with lower personnel costs 
in addition  general and administrative expenditures are also projected to decrease as a result of the closure of the riverside facility 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december revenue revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million decline in revenue is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues in the first half of relative to the first half of in the second half of our revenue improved and revenue for the second half of was greater than the comparable period of we believe the drop in revenue in the first half of was primarily due to a decrease in demand for telecom equipment in the usa  asia and south america 
in the second half of revenue was principally driven by growth in africa  primarily sales to siemens in south africa  and asia  mainly as a result of sales by airspan israel  which we acquired in october cost of revenue and inventory provision cost of revenue decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to the decrease in revenue 
during both and we wrote down material amounts of inventory 
during the third quarter of we ceased marketing certain product variants and we also undertook a detailed review of the levels and mix of related inventory 
as a result we wrote down inventory in the third quarter of by million 
as a result of the decline in revenue for the first six months of  we reassessed the levels of excess and obsolete inventory and decided to write down inventory by million in the second quarter of without giving effect to the inventory write downs  our gross margin 
table of contents would have been for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the decline in gross margin was primarily a function of certain relatively fixed period costs being allocated to a relatively smaller revenue base 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  as part of our operating expense reduction programs introduced in the third quarters of and  we re focused our research and development priorities to lower our ongoing product development costs 
we believe these cost savings will initially be offset by the additional research and development expenses that will be incurred to further develop the wipll business  which was acquired in october sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decline in sales and marketing expenses is primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue and the effect of our expense reduction programs 
the airspan israel products are being sold though our existing sales network and there has been no material increase in sales costs arising out of the acquisition 
in we wrote down receivables by million due to our concerns with customers in asia and eastern europe 
during we wrote down receivables by million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of our cost reduction programs  including reductions in personnel and our relocation from our original headquarters in sunrise florida to smaller offices in boca raton 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense decreased from million in the year ended december  to thousand in the year ended december  this reflects the full write down of all intangibles from the original set up of the company and the implementation of fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  where goodwill in no longer amortized 
the charge recorded during arises from the amortization of intangibles identified after our fourth quarter acquisition of airspan israel 
restructuring provision during both and we implemented expense reduction programs 
during the third quarter of  we made a restructuring provision of million to cover employee termination costs and facility closures 
during  we made restructuring provisions totaling million to cover further employee termination costs and facility closure costs 
as part of this million we recorded a million restructuring charge for the closure of our riverside  uxbridge facility 
the closure of this facility was a direct result of the decision to fully outsource all of our as and as product manufacturing 
for more information regarding restructuring  see the section above entitled restructuring 
interest and other income net interest and other income  which decreased from million for the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   consisted of interest earned on cash deposits with financial institutions  foreign exchange gains and losses on cash balances and the cost of purchasing foreign exchange contracts and options 
the decrease in interest income arose from lower cash balances and lower interest rates in amounts from interest income were partially offset by interest expense of million in the year ended december 
table of contents  and million in the year ended december  interest expense decreased in as a result of the repayment of debt 
income taxes in general we did not record an income tax benefit for the tax losses generated in the uk because we have experienced operating losses since inception 
the tax credit provision of million includes a million credit to offset the income tax expense recorded on our extraordinary gain and a million income tax benefit for us tax losses offset against previous years federal income taxes paid on intercompany interest income 
the tax credit relates to the receipt million from the united kingdom tax authorities in lieu of carrying forward tax losses related to research and development costs 
the company has surrendered million of carry forward tax losses in the uk as a result 
extraordinary gain the company negotiated a settlement of its million promissory note with dsc telcom lp in the first quarter of under the settlement agreement  the company agreed to pay million in the first half of  in exchange for complete forgiveness of the debt owed by the company that was originally repayable in equal installments over three years starting february  in addition  the company and dsc telcom lp mutually released each other from certain claims made by the parties relating to the formation of airspan in january the extraordinary gain of million that arose from this transaction was partially offset by tax on the gain of million to show an extraordinary gain  net of taxes  of million 
net loss net loss increased by from million in to million in without giving effect to inventory provisions  bad debt provisions  restructuring provisions and extraordinary gains and taxes our loss for would have been million  and our loss for would have been million 
the decreases in gross profits million  without giving effect to inventory provisions and net interest and other income million  were more than offset by decreases in research and development costs million  sales and marketing expenses million and general and administrative expenses million 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december revenue revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the growth in revenue was due to the increased demand from the usa  africa and south america  which was partially offset by declines in europe 
the growth in africa and south america occurred as a result of further network build outs and the addition of new customers in those regions 
the strong growth in the usa was significantly aided by fcc mandated usage rules for pcs spectrum that was auctioned in  which require pcs operators to use that spectrum within years of acquiring it or to give it back to the us government 
our increase in revenue was driven by volume  rather than price increases 
cost of revenue cost of revenue increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the substantial increase in revenue 
during the third quarter of we ceased marketing certain product variants and we also undertook a detailed review of the levels and mix of related inventory 
as a result we wrote down inventory in the third quarter of by million 
excluding the inventory write down  gross margin was for the year ended december  and we were able to keep the gross margin at as a result of cost savings from product design changes and  to a lesser extent  efficiencies from increased volume and introduction of lower priced components in products sold  offset by lower selling prices 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  as part of our operating expense reduction program introduced in the third quarter of  we have re focused our research and development priorities to lower our ongoing product development costs 
under the program  we will focus spending only on those products we can sell in large volumes and in markets that we believe are strategic to our long term growth 
the full year effect of this program will be felt in sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   reflecting a higher headcount and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
during we wrote down receivables by million due to our concerns with customers and countries that have been most effected by economic slow downs 
in we created bad debt provisions of million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  this reflected our higher headcount  additional costs associated with being a public company and the full year costs of our corporate headquarters facility in florida that opened at the end of amortization of goodwill and intangibles amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   reflecting the full write off of purchase contracts and patents 
restructuring provision in the middle of  we announced our plan to reduce spending levels as a result of the global economic slow down in the telecommunications sector 
during the third quarter of  we made a restructuring provision of million to cover employee termination costs and facility closures 
there was no corresponding restructuring charge in interest and other income net interest and other income  which decreased from million for the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   consisted of interest earned on cash deposits with financial institutions  foreign exchange gains and losses on cash balances and the cost of purchasing foreign exchange contracts and options 
the decrease in interest income arose from lower cash balances and lower interest rates in amounts from interest income were partially offset by interest expense of million in the year ended december   predominantly on outstanding indebtedness owed to alcatel related to the purchase of the company s assets in january and million in the year ended december  interest expense decreased as a result of the prepayment of the debt to alcatel 
income taxes in general we did not record an income tax benefit for the tax losses generated in the uk because we have experienced operating losses since inception 
the tax provision relates to the repayment of overpaid us federal income taxes 
the tax credit provision of million includes a million credit to offset the income tax expense recorded on our extraordinary gain and a million income tax benefit for us tax losses offset against previous years federal income taxes paid on intercompany interest income 

table of contents extraordinary gain the company negotiated a settlement of its million promissory note with dsc telcom lp in the first quarter of under the settlement agreement  the company agreed to pay million in the first half of  in exchange for complete forgiveness of the debt owed by the company that was originally repayable in equal installments over three years starting february  in addition  the company and dsc telcom lp mutually released each other from certain claims made by the parties relating to the formation of airspan in january the extraordinary gain of million that arose from this transaction was partially offset by tax on the gain of million to show an extraordinary gain  net of taxes  of million 
net loss net loss decreased by from million in to million in before the inventory provision  bad debt provision  restructuring provision and extraordinary gain our net loss for was million  a decrease over this was primarily due to the increase in gross profit of million before provisions  and decrease in research and development costs of million  which were partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses of million and million  respectively  and a decrease in net interest and other income of million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  short term investments totaling million and million of restricted cash that is held as collateral for performance guarantees on customer and supplier contracts and with landlords 
we do not have a line of credit or similar borrowing facility  nor do we have any material capital commitments 
since inception  we have financed our operations through private sales of convertible preferred stock  which totaled million net of transaction expenses and an initial public offering of common stock  which we completed on july  in that offering  we issued  shares of common stock for approximately million in cash net of underwriting discounts  commission and other expenses 
we have used the net proceeds of the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
at december   we had outstanding debt of million compared to million at december  until we are able to generate cash from operations  if ever  we intend to use our existing cash resources to finance our operations 
we believe we have sufficient cash resources to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months 
for the year ended december   we used million cash in operating activities compared with million for the year ended december  the difference between our net loss of million and the million cash used in operating activities principally arose from tighter working capital control 
during we reduced our receivables by million and while inventory increased by million this included million from the fourth quarter acquisition of airspan israel 
the net cash provided in investing activities for the year ended december  of million was the sum of the net movement in investment securities of million partially offset by capital equipment purchases of million  and the purchase of airspan israel  net of cash acquired  for million 
the net cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  of million was related to capital equipment purchases of million and the net increase in investment securities of million 
our financing cash flow for the year ended december  was a net inflow of million 
the inflow arose from a decrease of million in short term investments  a million purchase of treasury stock and a million increase in restricted cash 
restricted cash increases whenever the company issues a guarantee secured by cash collateral and decreases whenever such a guarantee is cancelled or expires according to its terms 

table of contents we have no material commitments other than obligations under our long term debt  operating leases  and the forward exchange contracts mentioned herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
as of december  and we had cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  in and  million and million related to investments with purchase to maturity dates between and days 
substantially all of the remaining amounts consisted of highly liquid investments with purchase to maturity terms of less than days 
these investments are exposed to interest rate risk  but a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by two percentage points from december  rates would cause the fair market value of these short term investments to change by an insignificant amount 
due to the short duration of these investments  a short term increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
declines in interest rates over time would  however  reduce our interest income 
due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken to mitigate this  and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis does not take into account any such action 
foreign currency exchange rate risk for the year ended december   of our sales were denominated in us dollars  were denominated in australian dollars  and the remaining were denominated predominantly in euro 
for the year ended december   of our sales were denominated in us dollars  and the remaining was denominated predominantly in euro 
our total australian dollar denominated sales for the year ended december  were aus million  which were recorded at an average exchange rate of us aus 
our total euro denominated sales for the year ended december  were million  which were recorded at an average exchange rate of us 
our total euro denominated sales for the year ended december  were million  which were recorded at an average exchange rate of us 
if the average exchange rates used had been higher or lower during by they would have decreased or increased the total australian dollar and euro denominated sales value by million 
we expect the proportions of sales in australian dollars and euro to fluctuate over time 
the company s sensitivity analysis for changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in changes in sales volumes 
since may  we have from time to time entered into fair value currency hedging contracts that lock in minimum exchange rates for payments due to us under some of our sales contracts where those payments are to be made in currencies other than us dollars 
we do not enter into any currency hedging activities for speculative purposes 
there was no impact from such contracts during on earnings  nor were there any fair value hedges outstanding at december  we will continue to monitor our foreign currency exposures and may modify our hedging strategies  as we deem appropriate 
we have also entered into cash flow currency hedges 
our operating results are affected by moves in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the rate between us dollars and us pounds sterling 
this is because most of our operating expenses  which may fluctuate over time  are incurred in pounds sterling and israeli shekels 
to manage our pound foreign currency risk we have  at various times in and  forecast our likely net spending in non us dollars until december  and  based on these forecasts  we have entered into forward exchange contracts to cover at least of the projected exposure 
we have entered into the following forward exchange contracts in october  we entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase million pounds sterling at an average exchange rate of us pounds sterling in eight equal amounts  from may to december at december  there were no contracts outstanding 

table of contents in may  we entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase million pounds sterling at an average exchange rate of us pounds sterling in six equal amounts  from january to june at december  these were outstanding at an average exchange rate of us pounds sterling 
in november  we entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase million pounds sterling at an average exchange rate of us pounds sterling in six equal amounts  from july to december at december  these were outstanding at an average exchange rate of us pounds sterling 
the total forward purchases of pounds sterling for the year ended december   was million pounds sterling  and we paid expenses in local currency of approximately million pounds sterling over the same period 
the effectiveness of the contracts as a hedge was therefore 
if the expenses in pounds sterling had not been hedged and the average exchange rates had been higher or lower by  the pound sterling denominated operating expenses would have decreased or increased by million 
for the years ended december  and we incurred the majority of our cost of revenue in us dollars 
equity price risk we do not own any equity investments  other than in our subsidiaries 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct equity price risk 
commodity price risk we do not enter into contracts for the purchase or sale of commodities 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct commodity price risk
