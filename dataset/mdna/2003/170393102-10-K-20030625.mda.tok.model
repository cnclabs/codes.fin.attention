overview we develop  manufacture and market products that perform diagnostic testing at sites outside of traditional hospital and clinical laboratories to assist in assessing for risk of heart disease  diabetes and certain liver diseases and in the monitoring of therapy to treat those diseases 
currently  we manufacture and sell the ldx system  which consists of an analyzer  a test cassette  a printer and accessories  and sell the gdx system  which consists of an analyzer  a test cartridge and accessories 
until december  our subsidiary wellcheck conducted consumer testing within the united states to help assess the risk of heart disease and other diseases 
using the ldx system and its test event activity management software teams  wellcheck collected test results and other patient data and aggregated that data for testing event sponsors use in marketing programs 
in december  we completed the sale of certain assets and the assignment of certain obligations of wellcheck to impacthealth 
we received a secured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of  due on the first anniversary of the issuance of the note  the right to receive an additional  contingent upon the attainment of certain performance measures and a royalty per participant tested with teams for three years after the date of the agreement 
in addition  we entered into a three year renewable supply agreement with impacthealth involving the purchase of the ldx system and single use test cassettes by impacthealth on an exclusive basis 
today  our revenue is from sales of diagnostic products  test cassettes  test cartridges and related accessories 
although we began marketing and distributing the gdx system in july  we expect that a substantial majority of our revenue will continue to be generated from sales of our ldx product for the foreseeable future 

table of contents net income in fiscal included a million gain from an income tax benefit 
the net deferred income tax benefit of million results from the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance previously established for our net operating losses 
based on our recent positive operating results  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that it was increasingly likely that we would be able to realize a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards in future periods thereby reducing taxes to be paid in those periods 
in connection with our long term growth strategy  we plan to dedicate additional resources in sales and marketing to enhance our market penetration of the physician office laboratory market 
we also plan to accelerate our research and development activities in order to introduce new products which can be utilized on our ldx analyzer 
in addition  we are investing a significant amount of capital to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations 
we also intend to seek opportunities to acquire or distribute single use test cassettes or other products which can be sold through our established distribution channels 
in addition  legislation to allow medicare reimbursement for cholesterol  was introduced on february  in both the senate and house of representatives  and for diabetes screening  was introduced on march  in the senate and may  in the house of representatives 
if this legislation is enacted  it may provide further opportunity for us to capitalize on the increasing need for testing in the physician office laboratory market to assess risk for heart disease and diabetes in individuals that we believe could result from passage of such legislation 
further  a major class of cholesterol lowering medications called statins may be approved by the fda for over the counter sales in the future  which could provide pharmacies with an incentive to conduct testing of patients in the pharmacy as part of a health awareness initiative and provide us with additional opportunities to market our products

the  provision for income taxes in fiscal represented the estimated state income taxes payable  reduced for the use of nols and tax credit carryforwards 
we recorded no provision for income taxes in fiscal due to the use of the net operating loss 
management expected to use nols and other tax carryforward amounts to the extent taxable income is earned in fiscal and beyond

therefore  we believed there was sufficient uncertainty at that time regarding our ability to generate future taxable income and use these nols and tax credit carryforwards such that a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was required at march  discontinued operations 
discontinued operations include all revenue  cost of revenue  compensation  benefits  travel and expenses for outside professional services including information services and legal related to the operations of wellcheck 
in december  we completed the sale of certain assets and the assignment of certain obligations of wellcheck 
discontinued operations costs decreased million  or  to million for fiscal  from million in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease was a fiscal impairment charge of million relating to certain capitalized website costs as we no longer expected future cash flows from the website to be sufficient to recover the capitalized development costs 
additionally  we entered into a large  non renewable contract from a single customer in january  which resulted in a higher revenue and contribution margin than in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  including employee stock option exercises  and net cash provided by operations 
from inception to march   we have raised million in net proceeds from equity financings 
as of march   we had million of cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments an increase of million  or from march  in addition to these amounts  we have available an million revolving bank line of credit agreement 
while the agreement is in effect  we are required to deposit assets with a collective value  as defined in the line of credit agreement  equivalent to no less than of the outstanding principal balance 
amounts outstanding under the line of credit bear interest at either our choice of below the bank s prime rate or above the libor rate  depending on the payment schedule 
the line of credit agreement expires on july  there were no borrowings under this line of credit during fiscal  and as of march   there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit 
net cash provided by operations during fiscal was million  which was million less than in fiscal the decline was primarily attributable to a decline in operating income before deferred taxes of  and an increase of million in cash used to fund working capital  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cash used for working capital in included an increase in accounts receivable of million due to an increase in revenues in the fourth fiscal 
table of contents quarter of compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of  an increase in inventories of million due to investment in inventory for single use test cassettes and gdx products  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of  due primarily to increased directors and officers insurance premiums 
this was offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  primarily due to increased inventory purchases 
additions to plant and equipment were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase relates mainly to tenant improvements as we expanded our office  warehouse and production space at our hayward location 
net investments in marketable securities were million  which were million  or  less than fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal for both years  cash provided by financing activities was primarily from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase and employee stock incentive plans 
during fiscal  we intend to invest approximately million in capital purchases related to expansion of our manufacturing capacity  tenant improvements  and research and development 
future minimum payments due under lease obligations  including the new lease for our hayward facility that commenced april   as of march in thousands non cancelable fiscal year operating leases total we expect that cash generated from our projected revenue  existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next months 
in the event that we would need additional financing for the operation of our business  we can draw upon our existing million line of credit which would require us to maintain cash and investments as collateral 
however  we may be required to finance any additional requirements through additional equity  debt financing or credit facilities

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories and income taxes 
we use 
table of contents authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is pervasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has transferred to our customers  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
provisions for discounts to customers  returns or other adjustments are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon analyses of historical discounts and returns 
we recognize revenue associated with services upon completion of the services to be performed under contract when all obligations are satisfied  and collection is reasonably assured 
if all conditions to recognize revenue are not met  we are required to defer revenue recognition 
in the event that the actual operating environment changes  our operating results for a particular period could be adversely affected 
we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for an estimated amount of losses that may result from a customer s inability to pay for product purchased 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we establish provisions for excess  obsolete and unusable inventories after evaluation of historical sales  forecasted sales  product expiration and current inventory levels 
during fiscal   was charged to cost of revenue to increase the provision for excess  obsolete and unusable inventory 
if the market value of our products decline  the demand for our products decline or if a significant amount of the material were to become unusable  our operating results could be adversely affected 
through the end of fiscal  we provided for income taxes based on estimated federal and state alternative minimum taxes payable  reduced for the use of nols and tax credit carryforwards 
we had historically experienced significant operating losses and operate in an industry subject to rapid technological changes  therefore  we believed there was sufficient uncertainty regarding our ability to generate future taxable income and use these nols and tax credit carryforwards such that a full valuation allowance for deferred tax asset was required at march  due to our ongoing profitability from continuing operations over the last eight fiscal quarters  management has elected to release million of our tax valuation allowance 
this represents our estimated tax benefits to be incurred over the next two fiscal years 
if we continue to remain profitable during the coming fiscal year and determine that realization of all or a portion of the nols is likely  then we will further reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance 
if the federal or state governments change the corporate income tax laws  our ability to use nols and tax credits could be reduced  adversely affecting our operating results

factors affecting future operating results we have a history of operating losses and fluctuating operating results  which may result in the market price of our common stock declining our revenue and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our first profitable quarter was the third quarter of fiscal  and our first profitable year was fiscal we recorded a net loss of million for fiscal  a net profit of million for fiscal and a net profit of million for fiscal the following are among the factors that could cause our revenue  operating results and margins to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter the timing and level of market acceptance of the ldx system and the gdx system  variations in manufacturing efficiencies  the timing of the introduction  availability and market acceptance of new tests and products  the timing and level of expenditures associated with research and development activities  
table of contents the timing and establishment of strategic distribution arrangements and the success of the activities conducted under such arrangements  changes in demand for our products based on changes in third party reimbursement  competition  changes in government regulation and other factors  the timing of significant orders from  and shipments  to customers  product pricing and discounts  additional cost of expanded leased facilities  promotional program spending by european pharmaceutical companies  variations in the mix of products sold  and general economic conditions 
these and other factors are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
fluctuations in quarterly demand for our products may cause our manufacturing operations to fluctuate in volume  increase uncertainty in operational planning and or affect cash flows from operations 
we commit to many of our expenses in advance  based on our expectations of future business needs 
these costs are largely fixed in the short term 
as a result  when business levels do not meet expectations  our fixed costs will not be recovered and we will experience losses 
this situation is likely to result in the future because of the variability and unpredictability of our revenue 
this also means that our results will likely not meet the expectations of public market security analysts or investors at one time or another  which may result in the market price of our common stock declining 
our business depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology through patents and other means and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others our success depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we have nine united states patents and have filed patent applications relating to our technology internationally under the patent cooperation treaty and individual foreign patent applications 
the risks of relying on the proprietary nature of our technology include our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of any patents  or  if issued  such patents may not offer protection against competitors with similar technology  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future  and the rights created under our patents may not provide a competitive advantage  competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources than us and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may seek to apply for and obtain patents covering technologies that are more effective than ours 
this could render our technologies or products obsolete or uncompetitive or could prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products either in the united states or in international markets  
table of contents the medical products industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may in the future become subject to patent infringement claims and litigation or interference proceedings conducted in the united states patent and trademark office to determine the priority of inventions 
litigation may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued to us  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  patent interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming and will likely result in substantially diverting the attention of technical and management personnel from our business operations 
we may also be subject to significant damages or equitable remedies regarding the development and sale of our products and operation of our business 
for information concerning current legal proceedings see legal proceedings in this annual report on form k 
we rely on trade secrets  technical know how and continuing invention to develop and maintain our competitive position 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology 
we may also be unable to adequately protect our right to our trade secrets 
our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile  which could result in substantial losses for investors the market price of our common stock has in the past been  and in the future is likely to be  highly volatile 
these fluctuations could result in substantial losses for investors 
our stock price may fluctuate for a number of reasons including quarterly variations in our operating results  developments in or disputes regarding patent or other proprietary rights  announcements of technological or competitive developments by us and our competitors  regulatory developments regarding us or our competitors  changes in the current structure of the healthcare financing and payment systems  stock market price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for medical products and high technology companies and which are often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies  and general economic  political and market conditions 
with the advent of the internet  new avenues have been created for the dissemination of information 
we do not have control over the information that is distributed and discussed on electronic bulletin boards and investment chat rooms 
the motives of the people or organizations that distribute such information may not be in our best interest or in the interest of our shareholders 
this  in addition 
table of contents to other forms of investment information  including newsletters and research publications  could result in a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock 
in addition  stock markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices for diagnostic product companies have been affected by these market fluctuations and such effects have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause a decline in the market price of our common stock 
securities class action litigation is often brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its stock 
this type of litigation has been brought against us in the past and could be brought against us in the future  which could result in substantial expense and damage awards and divert management s attention from running our business 
we depend on technology that we license from others  which may not be available to us in the future and would prevent us from introducing new products and harm our business our current products incorporate technologies that are the subject of patents issued to  and patent applications filed by  others 
we have obtained licenses for certain of these technologies 
we may in the future be required to obtain licenses for new products 
we may be unable to obtain licenses for technology patented by others on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we also may be unable to develop alternative approaches if we are unable to obtain licenses 
our future licenses may also not be adequate for the operation of our business 
failure to obtain adequate licenses on commercially reasonable terms could prevent us from introducing our products and severely harm our business 
if third party reimbursement for use of our products is eliminated or reduced  our sales will be greatly reduced and our business may fail in the united states  healthcare providers that purchase products such as the ldx system and the gdx system generally rely on third party payors  including private health insurance plans  federal medicare  state medicaid and managed care organizations  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure in which the product is being used 
we will be unable to successfully market our products if their purchase and use is not subject to reimbursement from government health authorities  private health insurers and other third party payors 
if this reimbursement is not available or is limited  healthcare providers will be much less likely to use our products  our sales will be greatly reduced and our business may fail 
there are current conditions in the healthcare industry that increase the possibility that third party payors may reduce or eliminate reimbursement for tests using our products in certain settings 
these conditions include third party payors are increasingly scrutinizing and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services  healthcare providers are moving toward a managed care system in which they provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per patient and authorize fewer elective procedures  such as the use of our products for diagnostic screening  general uncertainty regarding what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods used by third party payors and how that will affect the use of products such 
table of contents as ours  which may deter healthcare providers from adopting the use of our products  and an overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to and will continue to lead to increased pressures on the healthcare industry  both domestic and international  to reduce the cost of products and services  including products offered by us 
market acceptance of our products in international markets is also dependent  in part  on the availability of reimbursement or funding  as the case may be  within prevailing healthcare systems 
reimbursement  funding and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country and include both government sponsored healthcare and private insurance 
third party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the united states or international markets  and current reimbursement or funding amounts may be decreased in the future 
also  future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors may adversely affect demand for our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
any of these events could materially harm our business 
if the healthcare system in the united states undergoes fundamental change  these changes may harm our business we believe that the healthcare industry in the united states is likely to undergo fundamental changes due to current political  economic and regulatory influences 
we anticipate that congress  state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems 
potential alternatives include mandated basic healthcare benefits  controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and medicare and medicaid spending  the creation of large insurance purchasing groups  price controls and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system 
we expect legislative debate to continue in the future and for market forces to demand reduced costs 
we cannot predict what impact the adoption of any federal or state healthcare reform measures  future private sector reform or market forces may have on our business 
any changes in the healthcare system could potentially have extremely negative effects on our business 
we may be unable to effectively compete against other providers of diagnostic products  which could cause our sales to decline the market for diagnostic products in which we operate is intensely competitive 
our competition consists primarily of clinical and hospital laboratories  as well as manufacturers of bench top analyzers 
to achieve and maintain market acceptance for the ldx system and the gdx system  we must demonstrate that the ldx system and the gdx system are attractive alternatives to bench top analyzers as well as to clinical and hospital laboratories 
this will require physicians to change their established means of having such tests performed 
the ldx system and the gdx system may be unable to compete with these other testing services and analyzers 
in addition  companies with a significant presence in the market for clinical diagnostics  such as abbott laboratories  bayer diagnostics  beckman coulter  inc and roche diagnostics a subsidiary of roche holdings  ltd 
have developed or are developing analyzers designed for point of care testing 
these competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than us 
these competitors also offer broader 
table of contents product lines than us  have greater name recognition than us and offer discounts as a competitive tactic 
in addition  several smaller companies are currently making or developing products that compete or will compete with ours 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
even if we do have such resources and capabilities  we may not employ them successfully 
our ldx system and gdx system have not yet achieved broad market acceptance in all of our target markets and if broad market acceptance does not occur  our operating results will be harmed our ldx system  including the ldx analyzer and single use test cassettes  currently accounts for substantially all of the revenue of our business 
if this revenue does not grow  our overall business will be severely harmed 
in addition  we have limited experience marketing and distributing the gdx system  and it is uncertain whether this product will achieve broad market acceptance in our target markets and generate significant revenue in the future 
for us to increase revenue  sustain profitability and maintain positive cash flows from operations  the ldx system and the gdx system must continue to and begin to gain market acceptance among healthcare providers  particularly physician office laboratories 
we have made only limited sales of the ldx system to physician office laboratories to date relative to the size of the available market 
factors that could prevent broad market acceptance of the ldx system and the gdx system include low levels of awareness of the availability of our technology in both the physician and other customer groups  the availability and pricing of other testing alternatives  many managed care organizations have contracts with laboratories  which require participating or employed physicians to send patient specimens to contracted laboratories  physicians are under growing pressure by medicare and other third party payors to limit their testing to medically necessary tests  and a decrease in the amount of reimbursement for performing tests on the ldx system and the gdx system 
if our ldx system does not achieve broader market acceptance and our gdx system does not achieve favorable market acceptance  our business will not grow 
even if we are successful in continuing to place our ldx analyzer at physician office laboratories and other near patient testing sites and marketing our gdx system  there can be no assurance that placement of these products will result in sustained demand for our single use test cassettes and single use test cartridges 
in addition  we must leverage our installed base of systems in order to increase the sales of our single use test cassettes and single use test cartridges 
if we are unable to increase the usage of cassettes on our current installed base  we will have to identify new customers and induce them to purchase an analyzer  which requires more time and effort and has a significantly larger purchase price than the single use test cassettes 
as a result of these many hurdles to achieving broad market acceptance for the ldx system and the gdx system  demand may not be sufficient to sustain revenue and profits from operations 
because 
table of contents the ldx system currently contributes the vast majority of our revenue  and we expect the gdx system to contribute a material portion of our revenue in the future  we could be required to cease operations if the ldx system and the gdx system do not achieve and maintain a significant level of market acceptance 
if we do not successfully develop  acquire or form alliances to introduce and market new tests and products  our future business will be harmed we believe our business will not grow significantly if we do not develop  acquire or form alliances for new tests and products to use in conjunction with the ldx system and the gdx system 
if new tests and products are not developed and accepted in the market  our business will not grow significantly and will be harmed 
developing new tests involves many significant problems and risks  including research and development is a very expensive process  research and development takes a very long time to result in a marketable product  significant costs including diversion of resources may be incurred in development before knowing if the development will result in a test that is commercially viable  a new test will not be successful unless it is effectively marketed to its target market  the manufacturing process for a new test must be reliable  cost efficient and high volume and must be developed and implemented in a timely manner to produce the test for sale  new tests must meet a significant market need to be successful  and new tests must obtain proper regulatory approvals to be marketed 
we could experience difficulties that delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new tests and products 
for example  regulatory clearance or approval of any new tests or products may not be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
we have experienced difficulties obtaining regulatory approval for tests in the past 
because the evaluation of applications by the fda for clia waived status is not based on precisely defined  objectively measurable criteria  we cannot predict the likelihood of obtaining clia waived status for future products 
we face risks from failures in our manufacturing processes we manufacture all of the single use test cassettes that are used with the ldx analyzer 
the manufacture of single use test cassettes is a highly complex and precise process that is sensitive to a wide variety of factors 
in the past  we have experienced lower than expected manufacturing yields that have adversely affected gross margins and delayed product shipments 
if we do not maintain acceptable manufacturing yields of test cassettes or experience product shipment delays  our business  financial 
table of contents condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we may reject or be unable to sell a substantial percentage of test cassettes because of raw materials variations or impurities  manufacturing process variances and impurities  and decreased manufacturing equipment performance 
our ldx and cassette manufacturing lines would be costly and time consuming to repair or replace if their operation were interrupted 
the interruption of our manufacturing operations or the loss of associates dedicated to the manufacturing facility could severely harm our business 
the risks involving our manufacturing lines include as our production levels have increased  we have been required to use our machinery more hours per day and the down time resulting from equipment failure has increased  the custom nature of much of our manufacturing equipment increases the time required to remedy equipment failures and replace equipment  we have a limited number of associates dedicated to the operation and maintenance of our manufacturing equipment  the loss of whom could impact our ability to effectively operate and service such equipment  we manufacture all cassettes at our hayward  california manufacturing facility  so manufacturing operations are at risk to interruption from earthquake  fire  power outages or other events affecting this one location  and we have recently completed the process of scaling up a new manufacturing line to production capability 
our failure to maintain production levels and operate this line at production capability for an extended period would impact our ability to increase our manufacturing capacity 
our operating results may suffer if we do not reduce our manufacturing costs we believe we will be required to reduce manufacturing costs for new and existing test cassettes to achieve sustained profitability 
we currently operate two manufacturing lines for dry chemistry cassettes 
a third manufacturing line is currently used solely for research and development purposes 
the complexity and custom nature of our manufacturing process increases the amount of time and money required to add an additional manufacturing line 
in addition  we may need to implement additional cassette manufacturing cost reduction programs 
failure to maintain full production levels for our new manufacturing line could prevent us from satisfying customer orders in a timely manner  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of business and a failure to reduce manufacturing costs for dry chemistry tests  which could prevent us from achieving sustained profitability 
our future results could be harmed by economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with international sales historically  a significant portion of our total revenue has been generated outside of the united states 
international revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was approximately in fiscal 
table of contents and in fiscal we anticipate that international revenue will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
our revenue is generally denominated in united states dollars  however  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and  as a result  our future revenue from international operations may be unpredictable 
we make foreign currency denominated purchases related to our gdx system in the united kingdom 
this exposes us to risks associated with currency exchange fluctuations 
to minimize this risk  we have undertaken certain foreign currency hedging transactions  however  weakening of the dollar could make the cost of the gdx system less competitive in the domestic market  resulting in less predictable domestic revenue 
in addition to foreign currency risks  our international sales and operations may also be subject to the following risks our dependency on pharmaceutical companies promotional programs as a primary source of international revenue  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging nations  less effective protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  changes in tariffs and other trade protection measures  difficulties in managing international operations  and potential insolvency of international distributors and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods 
if we are unable to minimize the foregoing risks  they may harm our current and future international sales and  consequently  our business 
we depend on single source suppliers for certain materials used in our manufacturing process and failure of our suppliers to provide materials to us could harm our business we currently depend on single source vendors to provide certain subassemblies  components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products 
we also depend on a third party manufacturer for the gdx system 
any supply interruption in a single sourced material or product could restrict our ability to manufacture and distribute products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified 
we may not be successful in qualifying additional sources of supply on a timely basis  or at all 
failure to obtain a usable alternative source or product could prevent us from manufacturing and distributing our products  resulting in inability to fill orders  customer dissatisfaction and loss of business 
this would likely severely harm our business 
in addition  an uncorrected impurity or supplier s variation in material  either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process  could interfere with our ability to manufacture and distribute products 
because we are a small customer of many of our suppliers and we purchase their subassemblies  components and materials with purchase orders instead of long term commitments  our suppliers may not devote adequate resources to supplying our needs 
any interruption or reduction in the future supply of any materials currently obtained from single or limited sources could severely harm our business 

table of contents we depend on distributors to sell our products and failure to maintain and expand these relationships could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue to increase revenue and achieve sustained profitability  we will have to maintain and expand our existing distribution relationships and develop new distribution relationships 
we are dependent on our distributors to assist us in promoting market acceptance of the ldx system and the gdx system 
however  we may be unable to enter into and maintain new arrangements on a timely basis  or at all 
even if we do enter into additional distributor relationships  those distributors may not devote the resources necessary to provide effective sales and marketing support to our products 
in addition  our distributors sell products offered by our competitors 
if our competitors offer our distributors more favorable terms or have more products available to meet their needs  those distributors may de emphasize or decline to carry our products 
if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with distributors or to expand our distribution channels  our business will suffer 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a substantial part of our revenue sales to a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in each fiscal period 
we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue in future periods 
our top ten customers comprised of our revenue in fiscal in fiscal  pss accounted for approximately of our total revenue and mckesson accounted for of our total revenue 
in fiscal  pss accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
we have experienced periods in which sales to some of our major customers  as a percentage of total revenue  have fluctuated due to delays or failures to place expected orders 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our customers  who generally purchase our products pursuant to cancelable short term purchase orders 
if we were to lose a major customer or if orders by or shipments to a major customer were to otherwise decrease or be delayed  our operating results would be harmed 
our products are subject to multiple levels of government regulation and any regulatory changes are difficult to predict and may be damaging to our business the manufacture and sale of our diagnostic products  including the ldx system and the gdx system  is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
we are unable to commence marketing or commercial sales in the united states of any of the new tests we develop until we receive the required clearances and approvals 
the process of obtaining required regulatory clearances and approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
as a result  our new tests under development  even if successfully developed  may never obtain such clearance or approval 
additionally  certain material changes to products that have already been cleared or approved are subject to further review and clearance or approval 
medical devices are subject to continual review  and later discovery of previously unknown problems with a cleared product may result in restrictions on the product s marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market 
if we lose previously obtained clearances  or fail to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements  we may be unable to market the affected products  which would depress our revenue and severely harm our business 
in addition  any future amendment or addition to regulations impacting our products could prevent us from marketing the ldx system and the gdx system 
regulatory changes could hurt our business by increasing burdens on our products or by reducing or eliminating certain competitive advantages of 
table of contents the ldx system s and the gdx system s waived status 
food and drug administration clearance or approval of products such as ours can be obtained by either of two processes the k clearance process  which generally takes from four to months but may take longer  and the pre market approval process  which is a longer and more costly process than a k clearance process  involves the submission of extensive supporting data and clinical information and generally takes one to three years but may take significantly longer 
if our future products are required to obtain a pre market approval  this would significantly delay our ability to market those tests and significantly increase the costs of development 
the use of our products and those of our competitors is also affected by federal and state regulations  which provide for regulation of laboratory testing  as well as by the laws and regulations of foreign countries 
the scope of these regulations includes quality control  proficiency testing  personnel standards and inspections 
in the united states  clinical laboratory testing is regulated under the clinical laboratory improvement act of the ldx analyzer  our total cholesterol  high density lipoproteins  triglycerides and glucose tests in any combination  our alt test cassette  the gdx analyzer and ac test cartridges have been classified as waived from the application of many of the requirements under the clia 
we believe this waived classification is critical for our products to be successful in their domestic markets 
any failure of our new tests to obtain waived status under the clia will severely limit our ability to commercialize such tests 
loss of waived status for existing diagnostic products or failure to obtain waived status for new products could limit our revenue  which would severely harm our business 
we may not be able to use some or all of our deferred tax asset  which may adversely affect our financial results 
during fiscal we determined  based on eight consecutive quarters of income from continuing operations  it would be prudent to reduce our tax valuation allowance by million reflecting the economic benefits of our enterprise 
changes in existing tax law or adoption of new governmental tax laws or policies could limit  prevent or delay the use of our tax asset 
additionally  changes in the general domestic or world economic condition could result in significant reduction  or elimination of taxable income precluding us from using or eliminating our deferred tax asset 
in addition  united states income tax law imposes limitations on the ability of corporations to use net operating loss carryforwards if the corporation experiences a more than change in ownership during any three year period 
we cannot assure you that we will not take actions  such as the issuance of additional stock  that would cause an ownership change to occur 
accordingly  we may be limited to the amount we can use in any given year  so even if we have substantial net income  we may not be able to use our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
in addition  the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to examination by the internal revenue service  or irs  and are thus subject to adjustment or disallowance resulting from any such irs examination 
if we have taxable income in the future  and we are unable to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  our future tax payments could be higher and our financial results may suffer 

table of contents we may face fines or our manufacturing facilities could be closed if we fail to comply with manufacturing and environmental regulations our manufacturing processes and  in certain instances  those of our contract manufacturers  are subject to stringent federal  state and local regulations governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes 
failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in many things  including warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant pre market clearance or pre market approval for devices  withdrawal of approvals and criminal prosecution 
any of these developments could harm our business 
we and our contract manufacturers are also subject to federal  state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture of healthcare products and diagnostic devices  including quality system regulations  which requires the maintenance of a quality system consistent with food and drug administration regulations  iso en requirements  which is an industry standard for maintaining and assuring conformance to quality standards  and other foreign regulations and state and local health  safety and environmental regulations  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
changes in existing regulations or adoption of new governmental regulations or policies could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products or require us to incur significant costs to comply with manufacturing and environmental regulations  which could harm our business 
a continuation of the general economic downturn in the united states or abroad may reduce our revenue and harm our business the primary customers for our products are physician office laboratories and entities conducting health promotion programs 
any significant downturn in domestic or global economic conditions which results in the reduction of the capital spending budgets of our customers or a delay in capital equipment purchases would likely result in a decline in demand for our products and could be detrimental to our business 
economic growth in the united states and other countries has slowed significantly and many commentators believe that the united states economy is experiencing a recession 
overall  customer spending is getting tighter and spending decisions are being more closely scrutinized 
these conditions have negatively impacted our business and may continue to do so if they persist 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions which could have an adverse impact on our business if they are unsuccessful we continue to evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and we may pursue product  technology or business acquisitions 
these acquisitions could be very costly  could result in dilution to existing investors and could result in integration problems that harm our business as a whole 
any acquisition could result in expending significant amounts of cash  issuing potentially dilutive equity securities or incurring debt or unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business 
in addition  our acquisitions may not be successful in achieving our desired strategic objectives  which could materially harm our operating results and business 
acquisitions may also result in difficulties in assimilating the operations  technologies  products  services and personnel of the acquired company or business or in 
table of contents achieving the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated 
these difficulties could result in additional expenses  diversion of management attention and an inability to respond quickly to market issues 
any of these results could harm us financially 
if we are successful in growing sales  our business will be harmed if we cannot effectively manage the operational and management challenges of growth if we are successful in achieving and maintaining market acceptance for the ldx system and the gdx system  we will be required to expand our operations  particularly in the areas of sales  marketing and manufacturing 
as we expand our operations  this expansion will likely result in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and place significant strain on our management  operating and financial systems and resources 
to accommodate any such growth and compete effectively  we will be required to implement and improve our information systems  procedures and controls  and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
any failure to implement and improve operational  financial and management systems or to manage our work force as required by future growth  if any  could harm our business and prevent us from improving our financial condition as a result of increased sales 
we depend upon key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and  without additional qualified associates  we cannot grow our business our success depends in significant part on the continued service of certain key scientific  technical  regulatory and managerial personnel 
our success will also require us to continue to identify  attract  hire and retain additional highly qualified personnel in those areas 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our industry 
we may be unable to retain our key personnel or attract or retain other necessary highly qualified personnel in the future  which would harm the development of our business 
product liability and professional liability suits against us could result in expensive and time consuming litigation  payment of substantial damages and an increase in our insurance rates sale and use of our products and the past performance of testing services by our formerly wholly owned subsidiary could lead to the filing of a product liability or professional liability claim 
if any of these claims are brought  we may have to expend significant resources defending against them 
if we are found liable for any of these claims  we may have to pay damages that could severely hurt our financial position 
loss of these claims could also hurt our reputation  resulting in our losing business and market share 
the medical testing industry has historically been litigious  and we face financial exposure to these liability claims if use of our products results in personal injury or improper diagnosis 
we also face the possibility that defects in the design or manufacture of our products might necessitate a product recall 
we currently maintain product liability insurance and professional liability insurance for claims relating to the past performance of testing services  but there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate 
insurance is expensive and difficult to obtain  and we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability 
inability to maintain insurance at an 
table of contents acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability could prevent or inhibit the continued commercialization of our products 
in addition  a product liability or professional liability claim in excess of relevant insurance coverage or a product recall could severely hurt our financial condition 
we may need additional capital in the future to support our growth  and such additional funds may not be available to us we intend to expend substantial funds for capital expenditures and working capital related to research and development  expansion of sales and marketing activities and other working capital and general corporate purposes 
although we believe our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash flow anticipated to be generated by future operations and available bank borrowings under an existing line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future  we may still require additional financing 
for example  we may be required to expend greater than anticipated funds if unforeseen difficulties arise in expanding manufacturing capacity for existing cassettes or in the course of completing required additional development  obtaining necessary regulatory approvals  obtaining waived status under clia or introducing or scaling up manufacturing for new tests 
if we need additional capital in the future  we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our existing shareholders or have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders 
if we raise additional capital through borrowings  the terms of such borrowings may impose limitations on how our management may operate the business in the future 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could prevent us from developing our products and our business 
we have made use of a device to limit the possibility that we are acquired  which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders 
to date  our board of directors has designated  shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our poison pill antitakeover plan 
the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of our company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock 
the poison pill may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
the poison pill may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors  except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation  purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the poison pill 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures our exposure to market risks is inherent in our operations  primarily to interest rates relating to our investment portfolio 

table of contents we are subject to interest rate risks on cash and cash equivalents  available for sale marketable securities and any future financing requirements 
interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by managing maturities in our marketable securities portfolio 
we have concluded that the fair market value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by short term changes in interest rates due to the nature of our marketable securities  which have maturity dates that do not exceed fiscal and have primarily fixed interest rates 
we enter into forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exposures arising from inventory purchases and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies 
our policy is to hedge of all committed purchase contracts and a lesser percentage for forecasted purchases 
at march   we had outstanding forward contracts to purchase million for approximately million 
the open contracts mature at various dates through december  and hedge certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in the british pound sterling 
the unrealized loss on the forward contracts at march  was  all of which is expected to be reclassified to earnings within the next months 
there was no gain or loss recorded in the period from hedge ineffectiveness or from forecasted transactions no longer expected to occur 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 
we do not expect gains or losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our financial results 
the following table presents the future principal cash flows or amount and related weighted average interest rates expected by year for our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments 
fiscal year total fair value in thousands cash  cash equivalents short term marketable securities weighted average interest rate long term marketable securities weighted average interest rate qualitative disclosures our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to available for sale securities will fall in value if market interest rates increase  and the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations 
we have the ability to hold at least a portion of the fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect the operating results or cash flows to be affected to a significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short and long term marketable securities portfolio
