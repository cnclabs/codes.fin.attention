item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes and tables included elsewhere in this report 
throughout this report the terms ynb  company  we  us  our  and corporation refer to yardville national bancorp  our wholly owned banking subsidiary the yardville national bank the bank and other wholly owned subsidiaries as a consolidated entity 
the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to assist in the understanding and the evaluation of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of our operations 
overview the rebound of our profitability in was primarily due to the significant increase in our net interest income 
the reduction in our cost of liabilities  and continued strong loan and deposit growth in resulted in a increase in net income 
loans and deposits grew and  respectively  this past year 
our strong philosophy of relationship banking has contributed to the growth in ynb s asset base  which totaled billion at december  our goals are to further develop the earnings power of ynb s branches and increase the value of our franchise 
in  we continued our retail expansion  opening three new branches in the demographically strong markets of hunterdon and middlesex counties in new jersey 
we also expect to open our first branch in attractive somerset county  new jersey in to support the strong growth experienced and continued growth plans  we raised additional equity capital in the last quarter of a common stock offering  completed in december  raised net new capital of million and will support our ongoing expansion 
summary of financial results ynb earned net income of million or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to million or for the year ended december  this represents an increase of and  respectively  in we posted net income of million or per diluted share in the improvement in net income of million in was driven by an increase of million in net interest income 
the improvement in net interest income was primarily the result of the reduction in our cost of funds and continued strong commercial loan growth 
ynb s cost of liabilities declined million in from certificates of deposit cds  which represented of our total deposit base at december   repriced basis points lower during reducing the cost of those funds from in to in total loans outstanding increased reaching a record level of billion at december  interest and fees on loans increased million from million in to million in overall loan quality remained strong as nonperforming assets to total assets decreased to in earnings per share  on a diluted basis  increased for the same reasons previously discussed 
due principally to the higher average shares outstanding related to the full impact of the private equity placement completed in august the percentage increase in diluted earnings per share in was less than net income 
the key profitability ratios of return on average assets roa and return on average stockholders equity roe rebounded in as well 
our roa increased to from in while roe increased to in from in we expect that the implementation of our retail strategy  described in this annual report  which is designed to further lower our cost of funds and build non interest income  should begin to move our roa higher in the future 
conversely  the issuance of million common shares from our public common stock offering in late will have a negative impact on our roe and earnings per share measurements in as the new capital is put to work over time  we expect roe to return to levels experienced previously 
our higher level of net interest income also had a positive impact on ynb s efficiency ratio  which declined to in from in net interest income net interest income is the largest and most significant component of our operating income 
net interest income is the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
this component represented of ynb s revenues in net interest income depends upon the relative amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
net interest income is also impacted by changes in interest rates and the shape of market yield curves 
our goal is to optimize net interest income performance in varying interest rate environments 
the following tables set forth our consolidated average balances of assets and liabilities and the related yields and costs for the years ended december     and average yields for each year are derived by dividing income by the average balance of the related assets and average costs are derived by dividing expense by the average balance of the related liabilities 
the yields and costs include fees  costs  premiums and discounts  which are considered adjustments to interest rates

for the purpose of calculating loan yields  average loan balances include nonaccrual loans with no related interest income 
the interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
in order to present pre tax income and resultant yields on tax exempt investments and loans on a basis comparable to those on taxable investments and loans  a tax equivalent adjustment is made to interest income 
the tax equivalent adjustment has been computed using a federal income tax rate of and has the effect of increasing interest income by     and  for the years ended december      and  respectively 
average balances  yields and costs continued december  december  december  average average average average yield average yield average yield balance interest cost balance interest cost balance interest cost changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction between the volume and composition of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  related yields  and associated funding costs

net interest income totaled million in  an increase of million or from net interest income of million in the prior year s decrease was from s net interest income of million 
the principal factor contributing to the increase in net interest income in was a decrease in interest expense of million resulting from a lower cost of basis points on interest bearing liabilities  and to a lesser extent  the change in composition of our deposit base and the increased volumes of loans and securities 
in  the interest rate spread increased basis points and the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis increased basis points to 
in  the net interest spread declined basis points and the net interest margin declined basis points to from in interest income for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  average interest earning assets increased by million or to billion for compared to average interest earning assets of billion and billion in and  respectively 
due to the aggressive lowering of short term interest rates in prime rate declined basis points by the federal reserve and the low interest rate environment that continued through  the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points to by year end as compared to led by commercial loans  our average loan portfolio grew by to billion  with loan yields averaging in or basis points lower than ynb s floating rate commercial loans tied to the prime rate totaled approximately of the entire commercial portfolio at december  the average prime rate decreased from in to in contributing to the decline in our loan portfolio yield 
interest income on loans increased due to the growth shown above 
although our average securities portfolio increased million in  the decline in yield of basis points caused interest income on securities to decrease million 
during  we implemented a strategy to reduce the investment portfolio duration to better position our balance sheet for rising interest rates 
this action  while improving our longer term interest rate risk position for further information see market risk  negatively impacted net interest income and our net interest margin in interest expense was million for  a decrease of million  or from million a year ago 
interest expense totaled million in the decrease in interest expense in resulted primarily from lower rates on all interest bearing deposits  and to a lesser extent  on borrowed funds 
lower interest expense was partially offset by higher average balances on all interest bearing liabilities 
in december  we retired million in federal home loan bank fhlb advances early 
this transaction was designed to reduce longer term interest rate risk by repositioning a portion of our borrowed funds portfolio  and also resulted in positive improvement to net interest income and the net interest margin in interest expense on these funds declined approximately million in average interest bearing liabilities rose million or to billion for compared to average interest bearing liabilities of billion and billion in and  respectively 
the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in from in and in net interest income was million in  a decrease of from the million reported in the principal factor contributing to the decrease in net interest income in was an increase in interest expense of million resulting from increased borrowed funds and time deposit volumes 
in addition  the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities did not decline in proportion to yields on interest earning assets in the lower interest rate environment of compared to this was partially offset by increased volumes of loans and securities and the related interest income 
other factors  such as the investment growth strategy  the level of nonaccrual loans  and the balance of non interest bearing demand deposits have impacted our net interest income and net interest margin 
we manage a portion of our investment portfolio with the primary objective of enhancing return on average stockholders equity and earnings per share 
we refer to this as our investment growth strategy 
the income from this strategy has helped to offset the costs from the growth of our infrastructure and enhanced total net interest income 
in connection with this strategy  we utilize asset liability simulation models to analyze risk and reward relationships in different interest rate environments  based on the composition of investments in the portfolio and our overall interest rate risk position 
while this strategy has minimal credit risk  it does increase our overall interest rate risk 
the amount of securities managed in the investment growth strategy totaled million at december   or of our assets  and we have currently capped the strategy at million 
the net interest margin was negatively impacted by the investment growth strategy by approximately basis points in  basis points in  and basis points in effective credit management has resulted in relatively low levels of nonaccrual loans 
nonaccrual loans totaled million in  an increase of million from the million reported in had such nonaccrual loans been paid based upon original contract terms  we would have recognized additional interest income of approximately  in   in  and  in moreover  ynb s net interest margin would have been higher in and  and higher in the targeting of small to mid size businesses and individuals who value long term relationships and personal service has led to success in acquiring core business and personal checking accounts 
average non interest bearing demand deposits increased to million in from million in throughout the comparative periods  increases in average non interest bearing demand deposits have made a positive contribution to net interest income and the net interest margin 
we are continuing our efforts to improve our net interest margin in the low interest rate environment and higher than anticipated prepayment speeds on mortgage backed securities in the last quarter of negatively impacted the investment portfolio yield by basis points  which accounted for the slight margin compression in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarters in we have implemented several strategies during and into designed to increase net interest income and our net interest margin 
interest rate floors were instituted on approximately of our floating rate commercial loans in  which should protect net interest income should rates continue to fall 
the investment portfolio has been repositioned to generate higher levels of net interest income in what  we believe  will be a gradually increasing interest rate environment in the second half of the greatest opportunity  however  to enhance net interest income will be the successful implementation of our retail strategy 
the expansion of our branch network in new and existing markets  the enhancement of our brand image and marketing of our products and services is expected to reduce ynb s cost of funds and raise our net interest margin over time 
non interest income in  non interest income primarily consisted of service charges on deposit accounts  net securities gains  earnings on bank owned life insurance boli and other service fees 
non interest income totaled million in compared to million the prior year  an increase of  or 
the primary reason for the improvement was service charges on deposit accounts  which increased  non interest income in increased by million  or from s total of million 
the increase for that period was due to higher securities gains and an increase in earnings on boli 
the major components of non interest income are presented in the following table 
year ended december  in thousands service charges on deposit accounts    securities gains  net   earnings on bank owned life insurance   other service fees  investment and insurance fees gains on sales of mortgages  net other non interest income total    service charges on deposit accounts represent the largest single source of core non interest income 
service charges on deposit accounts increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increases were due principally to increased income from overdraft fees and to additional branch locations generating a larger base of transaction accounts and the related fee income 
we have continued targeted marketing campaigns on lower cost or interest free demand deposit accounts designed to lower our cost of funds and generate additional service charge or fee income 
net gains on the sale of securities totaled million in compared to net securities gains of million and  respectively  in and in  net gains resulted primarily from the sale of fixed rate year mortgage backed securities  year fixed rate trust preferred securities and other securities with longer duration or extension risk 
this strategy restricted the improvement in our net interest margin during to achieve the asset and liability objective of reducing longer term interest rate risk in a rising interest rate environment 
earnings on boli totaled million in  a decrease of  or compared to million in the modest decline in income was primarily due to lower yields on the floating rate portion of boli assets we own 
income from boli totaled  in in december  we purchased an additional million of boli assets  bringing our total investment in boli assets to approximately million 
the purchase of boli assets in had little impact on our liquidity position 
as was the case with all of our boli asset purchases  after the initial purchase there are no additional premiums paid on these policies 
boli assets offset the cost of deferred compensation plans and reduce our overall effective tax rate 
we also generate non interest income from a variety of fee based services 
these include second check r fees  automated teller machine atm fees on non customers  cash management and other customer related service fees 
fee schedules are reviewed annually to reflect our current costs and competitive factors 
other service fees increased to million in from  in other service fees totaled  in other non interest income is primarily composed of income derived from mortgage servicing and safe deposit box rentals 
other non interest income totaled  in  a decrease of  or when compared to  in other non interest income totaled  in non interest income represented only of our total revenues in as part of our longer term strategic objective of increasing non interest income  we have introduced several initiatives over the last few years and will continue to do so 
started in  ynb financial services  inc generated  in investment and insurance fees in by offering a comprehensive array of financial planning  investment  and insurance products to individual and business customers through third party providers 
in  we introduced enhanced internet banking services  that include electronic bill payment 
looking forward in  we will be offering enhanced cash management services 
we anticipate these services  requested by our customers  will provide additional non interest income or increased non interest bearing balances  which would be expected to generate additional net interest income 
non interest expense non interest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment and all other operating expenses we incur 
non interest expense totaled million in  an increase of million or  compared to million in non interest expense in increased from million in the largest increases in non interest expense in compared to were primarily in salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expense 
in  we early adopted statement of financial accounting standards board fasb no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement eliminated the treatment of the early retirement of debt expense as an extraordinary item 
consequently  the early retirement of debt expense of million has been reclassified as a non interest expense for the increase in non interest expense was partially offset by the absence of early retirement of debt expense in the following table presents the major components of non interest expense for the years indicated 
year ended december  in thousands salaries and employee benefits    occupancy expense  net    equipment expense    marketing   stationery and supplies communication and postage outside services and processing audit and examination fees other real estate expenses attorneys fees insurance other fdic insurance premium amortization of trust preferred expenses early retirement of debt expense  other    total    salaries and employee benefits  which represent the largest portion of non interest expense  increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in these expenses increased million or over the opening of two branches and our northern regional headquarters office during contributed to the increase in salaries and employee benefits 
also  executive management was strengthened  and experienced retail  lending and administrative personnel were hired as part of our strategic plan 
full time equivalent employees increased to at december  from at december  from these staffing increases and in addition to annual merit increases  salaries rose approximately million or 
employee benefit expense totaled million  an increase of  or from increases in benefits costs are primarily related to higher health benefit costs on a broader employee base  various payroll taxes  and our employee stock ownership plan esop 
salaries and employee benefits were million in  an increase of from million in the increase was primarily due to the addition of new branch staffing  administrative staff and lending professionals 
rising health benefit expenses  payroll taxes  and costs associated with executive deferred compensation plans also contributed to the increase for the comparable periods 
salaries and employee benefits  as a percent of average assets  were in  in  and in  respectively 
net occupancy expense increased  or to million in from million in total rent expense on leased properties increased  and was the primary reason for the increase in occupancy expense in the increase in rent expense and other facility related expenses was due to several factors 
occupancy expense in reflected a full year s rent expense for our operations center relocated in the last quarter of and our bordentown branch opened in in addition  we opened two new branches in hunterdon county  including one in our regional headquarters  and our first branch in middlesex county in the increase in occupancy expense in compared to was due primarily to higher rent expense from new branches in flemington  lawrence and bordentown and normal rent increases on other leased branch properties  as well as the relocation of our operations center into a new leased facility 
occupancy expense as a percentage of average assets remained constant at in   and equipment expense increased  or to million in from million in the increase in equipment expense was primarily due to higher depreciation expense  costs related to equipment maintenance  and the upgrade of technology to increase processing capacity  efficiency and service levels 
expenses associated with our atm machines also increased in the increase in equipment expenses in compared to was due to the same factors 
investment in technology and equipment has allowed us to improve service response time at our branches and further develop business and consumer products and services 
our expense base is reflective of a growing institution 
expenses such as communication and postage  stationery and supplies have grown as the number of facilities  phone lines and new accounts have increased 
in  we are projecting additional expenses associated with the continuing implementation of our retail strategy 
marketing expenses increased by  or in to million  compared to  in marketing expenses were million in we continue focused marketing campaigns with the goal of attracting lower cost deposits 
we also continued our support of community activities in projected marketing expenses for are expected to increase as we further develop our brand image and market our products and services in both new and existing markets 
other real estate ore expenses decreased  to  in when compared to more efficient management and the lower level of ore properties held in resulted in less expenses 
ore expenses for decreased  to  from  in other expenses include various professional fees  loan related expenses and other operating expenses 
other expenses totaled million in compared to million in and the decrease in other expenses was primarily due to cost containment programs initiated during the year 
our ratio of non interest expense to average assets decreased to for compared to in and for we continuously assess the efficiency of our operations  seeking ways to best serve our customers while reducing operating costs 
an important industry productivity measure is the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total operating expenses by net interest income and other income 
an increase in the efficiency ratio can indicate that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income while a decrease would indicate a more efficient use of resources 
ynb s efficiency ratio decreased in to compared to in  and in the efficiency ratio improved in as our net interest income increased 
excluding net securities gains and the early retirement of debt expense  our efficiency ratio was  and for   and  respectively 
further improvements to the efficiency ratio depend on increases in net interest income  the level of non interest income and growth in non interest expenses 
income taxes the provision for income taxes  which is comprised of federal and state income taxes  was million in compared to million in and million in for  the income tax expense and effective tax rate reflect the reclassification of early retirement of debt expense 
the increase in tax expense in resulted from higher taxable income and increased new jersey state taxes  partially offset by higher levels of tax exempt income 
in july  the new jersey business tax reform act was passed 
this act created an alternative minimum assessment for companies that operate in new jersey 
the tax was retroactive to january  the alternative minimum tax may be used to offset future tax liabilities  and as such  a deferred tax asset of approximately  was established for the excess of this tax over the regular new jersey corporate business tax 
the provisions for income taxes for   and were at effective tax rates of   and  respectively 
financial condition years ended december  and total assets ynb s assets were billion at year end versus billion the previous year  an increase of million  or 
the growth in our asset base throughout was primarily due to an increase in loans and securities 
average loans and securities grew and  respectively  in ynb s strength as a business focused  relationship oriented independent community bank was reflected in our financial results in headquartered in mercer county for years and having established commercial loans as the foundation for our growth  we are now focusing our efforts in expanding our retail network in the demographically attractive markets of hunterdon  somerset and middlesex counties in new jersey 
we believe that the strength of our markets  relationship banking philosophy and experienced management team  combined with industry consolidation  provide us with continued opportunities to expand market share and attain the goal of enhancing our franchise value 
average interest earning assets in were billion  a increase from billion in the growth in average interest earning assets was principally funded by the increase in average interest bearing deposits  and  to a lesser extent  borrowed funds 
further supporting average interest earning asset growth was a increase in average stockholders equity 
ynb s ratio of average interest earning assets to average assets increased slightly to in  compared to in securities ynb s securities portfolio totaled million or of assets at december  versus million  or of assets at december  this represents a million or increase from in addition to providing a reliable income stream  effective investment portfolio management has provided a stable secondary liquidity source  a tool for managing interest rate risk and a method of reducing our overall effective tax rate 
we also manage a portion of our investment portfolio  in our investment growth strategy  with the primary goals of enhancing return on average stockholders equity and earnings per share 
on an average basis  the securities portfolio represented of average interest earning assets for the year ended december   compared to of average interest earning assets for the year ended december  securities included in the investment growth strategy totaled approximately million at december   compared to approximately million at december  this represents a decrease of in this strategy is comprised primarily of fixed rate agency mortgage backed securities 
we determined in mid  based on the limited market opportunities in a lower interest rate environment  not to replace cash flows from our investment growth strategy 
we believe the investment growth strategy  as a percentage of our total assets  will continue to decline over time as our asset base continues to grow 
the available for sale afs securities portfolio increased million to million at december  from million at december  the available for sale portfolio principally consists of us agency mortgage backed securities and government agency bonds  both callable and non callable 
a continuing lower interest rate environment  in addition to strategies implemented to reduce longer term interest rate risk exposure in a rising rate environment  resulted in a change in the composition of the afs portfolio in during  we sold year fixed rate mortgage backed and trust preferred securities  and other securities with longer duration or extension risk to reduce the average duration of the securities portfolio and more effectively manage longer term interest rate risk in a rising rate environment 
shorter duration securities and floating rate trust preferred securities were purchased with the sale proceeds 
the repositioning of the afs portfolio is expected to provide more consistent cash flows to invest in securities in what we project to be a higher interest rate environment over the next eighteen months 
fixed rate us agency securities and fixed rate us agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos increased million and million  respectively in  accounting primarily for the net increase in the afs portfolio 
shorter duration us agency cmos and short term agency callable bonds were purchased to meet the asset and liability objectives of managing longer term interest rate risk and enhancing liquidity 
these securities were also purchased to reduce higher federal funds sold balances as the average yield for all of was only 
conversely  fixed rate us agency mortgage backed securities decreased million in  indicative of sales activity and higher than projected prepayment speeds 
the yield on the available for sale portfolio decreased basis points to in in the fourth quarter alone  our investment portfolio  which is made up of afs securities representing of the total  dropped in yield by approximately basis points  principally due to higher prepayment speeds which negatively impacted the yield on mortgage backed securities 
we also continue to invest in two money market funds 
the average investment in money market funds during was million 
the yields on these funds exceeded the yield on federal funds sold by approximately to basis points in activity in the afs portfolio is undertaken primarily to manage liquidity and interest rate risk and to take advantage of market conditions that create more attractive returns 
afs securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  included as a separate component of stockholders equity 
volatility in the bond market continued throughout with the yield curve fluctuating often 
indicative of this volatility was the change in the market value of the afs portfolio 
to achieve previously stated asset and liability objectives  we took advantage of the volatile yield curve to reposition securities throughout  which resulted in net securities gains of million 
at december   securities available for sale had net unrealized gains of million compared to net unrealized gains of  at december  the net unrealized gain  net of tax effect  was million at december  compared to a net unrealized gain of  at december   and is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
trading securities are purchased specifically for short term appreciation with the intent of selling in the near future 
minimal net gains of  were realized on trading securities for there were no trading securities outstanding at december  investment securities classified as held to maturity totaled million at december  compared to million at december  securities in this category  for which there is the intent and the ability to hold to maturity  are carried at amortized historical cost 
this portfolio is comprised of state and municipal and agency mortgage backed securities 
the decline in the held to maturity portfolio was due to the call of million in callable agency securities 
partially offsetting this decline was net growth of million in the municipal bond portfolio 
the municipal bond portfolio grew to million at december  from million at december  municipal bonds were purchased to reduce our effective tax rate and enhance the tax equivalent yield of the portfolio 
based on our anticipated levels of taxable income  we expect in to increase the size of our municipal bond portfolio 
at december   investment securities had unrealized gains of million compared to net unrealized losses of  at december  the yield on this portfolio increased basis points to in as compared to in the following tables present the amortized cost and market values of ynb s securities portfolios as of december    and securities available for sale december  amortized market amortized market amortized market in thousands cost value cost value cost value us treasury securities and obligations of other us government agencies       mortgage backed securities       corporate obligations       federal reserve bank stock       federal home loan bank stock       total       investment securities december  amortized market amortized market amortized market in thousands cost value cost value cost value obligations of other us government agencies     obligations of state and political subdivisions       mortgage backed securities       total       the expected maturities and average weighted yields for ynb s securities portfolios as of december  are shown below

mortgage backed securities experience principal cash flows based on the activity on the underlying mortgages 
investments in mortgage backed securities involve prepayment and interest rate risk 
we attempt to minimize these risks by diversifying the coupons and final maturity dates of the mortgage backed securities  buying seasoned securities with consistent and predictable prepayment histories  average lives and yields 
at december   ynb had mortgage backed securities totaling million  of which million were fixed rate 
at december   ynb had mortgage backed securities totaling million  of which million were fixed rate 
certain of these securities can be purchased at premiums or discounts 
the risk of fixed rate mortgage backed securities is similar to fixed rate loans 
in rising interest rate environments  the rate of prepayment on fixed rate mortgage backed securities tends to decrease because of lower prepayments on the underlying mortgages  and conversely  as interest rates fall  prepayments on such securities tend to rise 
the yield and average lives of these securities will change based on prepayment speeds and how the premium or discount must be amortized or accreted 
significantly lower interest rates and higher than projected prepayment speeds led to lower than projected yields and million in principal cash flows from mortgage backed securities in  compared to million in included in mortgage backed securities are us agency cmos  which totaled approximately million at december   compared to million at december  a cmo is a mortgage backed security created by prioritizing the cash flows from the underlying mortgage pool in order to meet different objectives 
all cmos at december  were held in the available for sale portfolio 
loans we continue to emphasize commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending to small to mid sized businesses and individuals 
from december  to december   we increased our total loans from million to billion for a compound annual growth rate during that period 
we have achieved these results by stressing quality growth  product and industry diversification  while maintaining strong underwriting standards in a competitive environment 
loans historically have been the primary component of our earning assets 
by expanding geographically into new markets  we have continued to experience robust credit demand 
our larger capital base has resulted in a higher legal lending limit and attracted larger loan relationships and increased business from existing customers 
during  total loans increased million or  reaching billion at december  from billion at december  the following table sets forth ynb s loan portfolio composition at the dates indicated

ynb s loan portfolio represented of total assets at december  versus at year end at december   commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans represented of our total loans 
in underwriting these loans  we first evaluate the cash flow capability of the borrower to repay the loan as well as the borrower s business experience 
in addition  a majority of commercial loans are also secured by real estate and business assets  and supported by the personal guarantees of the principals 
we also diligently monitor the composition and quality of the overall commercial loan portfolio including significant credit concentrations by borrower or industry 
commercial real estate loans increased by million  or in to million from million at december  commercial real estate loans consist of owner occupied  investor occupied  and construction and development loans 
commercial real estate loans generally have a final maturity of five to fifteen years 
construction and development loans include residential and commercial projects 
loans are typically made to experienced residential or commercial construction developers 
residential construction loans include single family  multi family  and condominium projects 
commercial construction loans include office and professional development  retail development and other commercial related projects 
generally  construction loan terms run between one and two years and are interest only  adjustable rate loans indexed to the prime rate 
our lending policies generally require an or lower loan to value ratio for commercial real estate mortgages 
collateral values are established based upon independently prepared appraisals 
growth in commercial real estate loans accounted for of the total loan growth in compared to in residential loans are comprised of family and multi family loans 
this segment of the portfolio totaled million at december   up million  or from the prior year total of million 
the low interest rate environment stimulated ongoing refinancing activity and growth in this portfolio during residential family loans represented million  or of the total 
our residential mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the underlying real property 
we are a participating seller servicer with the federal national mortgage association fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and we generally underwrite our single family residential mortgage loans to conform with standards required by these agencies 
multi family loans  which represented million of the total  primarily consist of loans secured by apartment complexes 
commercial and industrial loans include term loans  lines of credit  and demand loans 
commercial and industrial loans increased million  or  at december  to million from million at december  higher balances on business lines of credit from both new and existing relationships primarily accounted for the increase in commercial and industrial loans 
these loans accounted for of the total loan growth in commercial and industrial loans are typically loans made to small to middle market businesses and consist of working capital loans  which are used to finance inventory  receivables  and other working capital needs of commercial borrowers 
in addition  term loans are provided for equipment needs 
as shown in the table below  we have maintained diversification of risk within industry classification concentrations with the goal of limiting the risk of loss from any single unexpected event or trend

home equity loans and lines represented of total consumer loans 
in  we believe that comparatively lower interest rates and increased marketing accounted for the increased activity in the home equity portfolio 
the expansion of our retail network is expected to generate additional opportunities to increase the size of our consumer loan portfolio 
substantially all of our business is with customers located within mercer county and contiguous counties 
changes in the region s economic environment and real estate market conditions could affect our borrowers ability to repay their loans  which could result in an adverse impact to our financial condition  performance and loan growth 
competition and future consolidation in our markets could also impact future loan growth 
total loan portfolio in millions we enter into a variety of financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit  both of which involve  to varying degrees  elements of risk in excess of the amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk for letters of credit is managed by limiting the total amount of arrangements outstanding and by applying normal credit policies to all activities with credit risk 
collateral is obtained based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
the contract amounts of off balance sheet financial instruments as of december  and for commitments to extend credit were million and million  respectively  and for letters of credit were million and million  respectively 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit may expire without being drawn upon  and therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements 
the following table provides information concerning the maturity and interest rate sensitivity of ynb s commercial and industrial and commercial real estate construction and development loan portfolios at december  after one after within but within five in thousands one year five years years total maturities commercial and industrial     commercial real estate construction and development    total     type floating rate loans     fixed rate loans     total     asset quality we have successfully grown our loan portfolio while at the same time maintaining high asset quality standards 
our significant lending experience  collateral based approach to lending  and the effective development and management of our commercial lending relationships have resulted in low levels of nonperforming assets and net charge offs 
nonperforming assets decreased  to million at december  compared to million at december  for the five years ended december   ynb s nonperforming assets have averaged less than million 
credit quality has remained strong during periods of robust loan growth 
nonperforming assets represented of total assets at december  and at december  the improvement in this ratio was due to both the growth in ynb s asset base and the reduction in nonperforming assets 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate were at december   compared to at december  indicative of our collateral based approach to lending  the ratio of net loan charge offs as a percent of average total loans was for the year ended december  and  based on year end ratios  has averaged for the five year period ended december  nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned 
nonperforming loans are composed of loans on a nonaccrual basis  loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but have not been classified as nonaccrual and loans whose terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
our policy regarding nonaccrual loans varies by loan type 
generally  commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual when they are days past due  unless these loans are well secured and in the process of collection or  regardless of the past due status of the loan  when management determines that the complete recovery of principal or interest is in doubt 
consumer loans are generally charged off after they become days past due 
residential mortgage loans are not generally placed on nonaccrual unless the value of the real estate has deteriorated to the point that a potential loss of principal or interest exists 
subsequent payments are credited to income only if collection of principal is not in doubt 
if principal and interest payments are brought contractually current  and future collectibility is reasonably assured  loans are returned to accrual status 
restructured loans remain on nonaccrual until collectibility improves and a satisfactory payment history is established  generally six consecutive monthly payments 
the following table sets forth nonperforming assets and risk elements in ynb s loan portfolio by type for the years indicated 
nonperforming assets december  in thousands nonaccrual loans commercial real estate    residential    commercial and industrial   consumer total nonaccrual loans      restructured loans loans days or more past due residential commercial and industrial consumer total loans days or more past due  total nonperforming loans      other real estate      total nonperforming assets      nonperforming loans totaled million at december   an increase of million from the million amount reported at december  the increase in nonperforming loans resulted from an increase in nonaccrual loans 
nonaccrual loans were million  or of total loans  at december  an increase of million from the december  total of million 
commercial real estate loans accounted principally for the increase in nonaccrual loans 
commercial loans represent approximately of total nonaccrual loans 
there was one restructured commercial loan totaling  at december  compared to  at december  based upon the recent payment history  this loan returned to accruing status in january at december   loans that were days or more past due but still accruing interest represented  or of total loans  compared to  or of total loans at december  six residential mortgage loans accounted for of total loans days or more past due 
management s decision to accrue interest on these loans is based on the level of collateral and the status of collection efforts 
other real estate ore totaled million at december   down from million at december  the decrease in ore for was principally due to the sale of one property 
ore is reported at the lower of cost or fair value at the time of acquisition and at the lower of fair value  less estimated costs to sell  or cost thereafter 
we believe that our historical low level of nonperforming assets in relation to an increasing loan portfolio is reflective of our credit culture  which includes strict underwriting standards  active loan review  and strong credit policies 
our objective is to maintain a high credit quality loan portfolio regardless of the economic climate 
the continuing weakness of the economy  however  could cause nonperforming asset levels to increase from their current or historical levels  which would have a negative impact on our earnings 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets allowance for loan losses we have identified the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy 
we utilize a system to rate substantially all of our loans based on their respective risk 
our emphasis on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans has provided higher earnings 
these loans  however  entail greater risk than residential mortgage and consumer loans 
the primary emphasis in our risk rating system is on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans 
risk is measured by use of a matrix  which is customized to measure the risk of each loan type 
risk ratings of to are considered to be acceptable risk and consist of loans rated as either minimal  modest  better than average  average and acceptable 
loans with acceptable risk were reserved at a range of to at december  risk ratings of between and are considered higher than acceptable risk and consist of loans rated as special mention  substandard and doubtful 
due to the higher level of risk  these loans were reserved at a range of to at december  loans with a risk rating of were considered to be a loss and reserved at at december  residential mortgage and consumer loans are assigned individual reserve percentages of between for the lowest risk to for higher risk loans 
in setting the reserve percentage for each risk rating  we utilize a computer software program to perform migration analysis to determine historical loan loss experience 
in addition  we use our judgment concerning the anticipated impact on credit risk of economic conditions  real estate values  interest rates and level of business activity 
allocations to the allowance for loan losses  both specific and general  are determined after this review 
we provide for possible loan losses by a charge to current operations to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level according to our documented allowance adequacy methodology 
the provision for loan losses for was million  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for loan losses in was principally due to three factors 
first  we continued to experience strong loan growth  principally commercial  in second was the modest increase of million in nonperforming loans 
a third factor was the weakening of credit quality of certain borrowers as reflected by risk rating downgrades in we believe that most of these downgrades reflected the impact of a slowing economy on the level of business activity 
if these trends continue in  there may be an increase in nonperforming loans 
our gross charge offs in totaled million  compared with million in and million in losses on loans and loans which are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance and subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to it 
our gross recoveries totaled  in  compared to  in and  in allowance for loan losses at or for the year ended december  in thousands allowance balance  beginning of year      charge offs commercial real estate residential commercial and industrial consumer total charge offs     recoveries commercial real estate commercial and industrial consumer total recoveries net charge offs    provision charged to operations      allowance balance  end of year      loans  end of year      average loans outstanding      allowance for loan losses to total loans net charge offs to average loans outstanding nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total assets nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate owned allowance for loan losses to nonperforming assets allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans at december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million  an increase of million or from million at december   which compares to million at december  the increase of the allowance reflected the extensive analysis previously discussed 
it is our assessment  based on our judgment and analysis  that the allowance is appropriate in relation to the credit risk at december  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was   and  at december    and  respectively 
another measure of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is the ratio of the allowance to total nonperforming loans 
at december  this ratio was versus at december  extending credit to businesses and consumers exposes us to credit risk 
we manage credit risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to strict underwriting standards  guidelines and limitations 
various approval levels  based on the amount of the loan and other credit considerations  have also been established 
we recognize that despite our best efforts to minimize risk  losses will occur 
in times of economic slowdown  either within our markets or nationally  the risk inherent in ynb s loan portfolio will increase 
the timing and amount of loan losses that may occur is dependent upon several factors  most notably current and expected general  regional and local economic conditions and the specific financial condition of our borrowers 
although we use the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term changes 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses the following table describes the allocation for loan losses among various categories of loans and certain other information as of the dates indicated 
an unallocated allowance is distributed proportionately among each loan category 
this unallocated portion of the loan loss allowance is important to maintain the overall allowance at a level that is adequate to absorb potential credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio 
the allocation is made for analytical purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future loan losses may occur 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of loans

ynb s deposit base consists of non interest and interest bearing demand deposits  savings and money market accounts  and time deposits 
in  we continued to implement our retail strategy 
our goal is to further develop the earnings power and increase the value of our retail franchise 
to achieve these goals  we plan to further reduce our cost of funds and increase our non interest income by attracting lower cost transaction and other core deposit accounts 
in  we continued our geographic expansion into the demographically attractive markets of hunterdon and middlesex counties with a planned entry into somerset county by mid through marketing of our expanded deposit product offerings  we expect to attract core deposits in our primary mercer county market in addition to targeted markets such as hunterdon  somerset and middlesex counties 
total deposits grew to billion at december  compared to billion at year end  an increase of 
the successful opening of branches in new markets and increased marketing resulted in growth across all deposit types 
the growth in our deposit base in was primarily in money market deposits  and  to a lesser extent  other time deposits 
average total deposits for totaled billion compared to billion for  an increase of 
the average rate paid on ynb s deposits during was  a basis point decrease from the average rate for as anticipated  our cost of funds dropped dramatically as higher costing time deposits repriced lower in due to the lower interest rate environment in and a strong liquidity position supported by cash flows from the investment portfolio we have aggressively lowered rates on time deposits 
our depositors preference in was our competitively priced premier money market account 
the result has been a lower cost of funds and change of composition in our deposit base 
time deposits were almost of total deposits at the end of and have declined to of our deposit base at december  growth in money markets accounted for almost of the total increase in deposits in deposit growth experienced in was also led primarily by money markets

during  we continued our strategy of reducing these generally higher costing cds generated through this service 
these cds  which totaled million at december   declined to million at year end the average maturity of these cds is approximately eleven months 
this funding source has represented a dependable source of secondary liquidity during times of increased loan demand 
we will continue our efforts to reduce our reliance on this generally higher cost of funds through the successful implementation of our retail strategy 
the average balance of non interest bearing demand deposits was million during  an increase of million  or from million during non interest bearing demand deposits represent a stable  interest free source of funds 
the increase in demand deposits is primarily from the growth in new and existing business relationships 
the increase in business and personal checking accounts has contributed positively to net interest income 
average interest bearing demand  money market and savings deposits increased   and  respectively  from to our primary deposit gathering strategy emphasizes growth in non interest bearing demand deposits and other low cost core deposits  such as interest bearing demand and money market accounts 
in  we marketed our core deposit accounts to both business and personal depositors 
money market deposits experienced the highest average growth  increasing by million 
the average cost of these deposits decreased from in to in due to the lower interest rate environment 
total average time deposits  which consist of certificates of deposit of  or more and other time deposits  which include individual retirement accounts  increased or million to million from million in the average months to maturity on the entire cd portfolio at december  was approximately twelve months 
as we expected  the cost of average time deposits decreased modestly in  due to the repricing characteristics of these deposits 
as these time deposits matured in  the cost of these deposits significantly decreased due to the lower interest rate environment and the aggressive lowering of cd or time deposit rates 
the average cost of time deposits declined basis points in to from in as we move into  time deposit costs should continue to drop 
the following table details amounts and maturities for certificates of deposit of  or more for the years indicated december  in thousands maturity range within three months   after three months but within six months   after six months but within twelve months   after twelve months   total   total deposits at year end in millions certificates of deposit of  or more totaled million  or of deposits  at december  compared to million  or of deposits at december  we believe the successful implementation of our retail strategy  which includes the expansion of our branch network  enhancing our brand image  and upgrading our technology infrastructure  will be the critical factors in attracting lower cost deposits and reducing our overall cost of funds 
by creating and expanding relationships in our established and new markets  we believe we can expand our net interest margin 
competition in our markets  our ability to fund our loan growth with lower costing core deposits  and the depositors desire to achieve the highest return possible on their money when interest rates eventually move higher  could affect net interest income levels and our net interest margin 
borrowed funds we utilize borrowed funds for our earning asset growth not supported by deposit generation and for asset and liability  and liquidity management purposes 
borrowed funds consist primarily of fhlb advances and  to a much lesser extent  securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
borrowed funds totaled million at december   an increase of million or when compared to million at december  the increase in borrowed funds was due to the addition of fhlb advances 
at december   borrowed funds represented of our assets compared to at year end fhlb advances totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the million increase in advances in was attributable to the purchase of callable advances with extended lockout periods to reduce interest rate risk exposure in a rising rate environment 
our fhlb advance portfolio includes callable advances that have terms of two to ten years and are callable after periods ranging from three months to five years 
callable borrowings totaled million at december   of which million have call dates in generally  when rates rise  some or all of these advances could be called and would then be replaced with higher costing borrowings 
conversely  when interest rates fall  advances will not be called and the duration would extend 
based on an analysis at year end  an increase of basis points in interest rates in would not trigger significant calls 
since  we have been a member of the fhlb of new york and have utilized advances for funding earning asset growth  enhancing liquidity  managing interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  funding for the investment growth strategy 
fhlb advances require no deposit insurance premiums and operational overhead costs are considerably less than those associated with deposits 
in december  million in fhlb advances were retired early  which resulted in a pre tax loss of million 
the purpose of this transaction was to strategically reposition a portion of our borrowed funds portfolio to meet asset and liquidity objectives designed to reduce longer term interest rate risk 
interest expense reduction on these liabilities totaled million in in april  management curtailed the use of year callable advances for purposes of the investment growth strategy 
much of the longer term interest rate risk in our balance sheet is embedded in the fhlb callable advances 
with the decreasing level of the investment growth strategy  fhlb advances are not expected to be used for that purpose in borrowed funds also include  related to our employee stock ownership plan esop 
initiated in  the esop purchased  shares of ynb s common stock with a loan from a nonaffiliated financial institution 
borrowed funds averaged million in  an increase of million from the million average reported in the average cost of borrowed funds decreased basis points during the year to compared with in the retirement of callable fhlb advances in late and repositioning into floating rate libor based advances primarily accounted for the decrease in the cost of borrowed funds in it is our goal in to reduce our level of fhlb borrowings 
there are million in advances maturing in based on our current liquidity projections our intent is to pay off these advances as they become due 
within approved policy guidelines  we will  however  continue to use borrowed funds as an alternative funding source or to meet desired business  asset and liability  and liquidity objectives 
asset and liability management the objective of asset and liability management is the prudent control of liquidity risk  market risk and the appropriate use of capital  while maximizing profitability 
our asset liability and investment committees provide oversight to the interest rate risk management process and recommend policy guidelines regarding exposure to interest rates for approval by the board of directors 
adherence to these policies is monitored on an ongoing basis and decisions related to the management of interest rate exposure due to changes in balance sheet composition and or market interest rates are made when appropriate and agreed to by these committees and approved by the board of directors 
liquidity liquidity represents the ability to maintain adequate cash flows to satisfy all of our present and anticipated financial obligations and commitments 
liquidity management refers to ynb s ability to support asset growth while satisfying the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers 
in addition to maintaining liquid assets  factors such as our capital position  profitability  asset quality and availability of funding affect our ability to meet liquidity needs 
traditional sources of liquidity include deposit growth  asset maturities and asset prepayments 
our focus on increasing core deposits to strengthen liquidity is ongoing 
in addition  we may use borrowed funds to further support and enhance liquidity 
liquidity can also be generated by the acquisition of funds through liability management 
as previously discussed  we strategically utilize a nationwide computer based service to generate cds to bolster liquidity and fund loan growth as well 
asset prepayments include proceeds from principal on loans and mortgage backed securities mbs 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mbs are generally a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and investment prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rates and competition 
brokered cd facilities are also available as another source of liquidity 
as part of liquidity management  we also have a contingency funding plan in place 
our contingency funding plan is structured to manage potential liquidity concerns due to changes in interest rates  credit markets or other external risks 
liquidity was again actively managed in  as strong earning asset growth continued 
we maintain a portion of our assets in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities  including us government agency and mortgage backed instruments  from which funds could be promptly generated 
total unpledged securities were approximately million at december  and million at december  we have built the unpledged security position by purchasing short term high quality securities with comparatively modest market value risk 
a higher level of federal funds sold may be experienced from time to time instead of building the unpledged security position 
this may be due to projected loan growth or investment opportunities in the marketplace 
liquidity can be further analyzed by utilizing our consolidated statements of cash flows 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was million 
this was primarily due to net increases in non interest bearing demand  money market  and savings deposits of million and borrowed funds of million 
net cash used by investing activities was million  consisting primarily of million in purchases of securities available for sale and a million net increase in loans  partially offset by maturities  calls  paydowns  and proceeds from sales of securities available for sale of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million 
overall  cash and cash equivalents increased million at year end compared to year end we are eligible to borrow additional funds from the fhlb subject to its stock level and collateral requirements  and individual advance proposals based on fhlb credit standards 
fhlb advances are collateralized by securities as well as residential and commercial mortgage loans 
we also have the ability to borrow at the federal reserve discount window 
we also maintain unsecured federal funds lines totaling million with four correspondent banks for daily funding needs 
active liquidity management remains a strategic focus  due to the strong asset growth we have experienced over the last several years 
we continue to develop additional funding sources to ensure our ability to continue to grow while maintaining sufficient liquidity 
our entry into new markets and branch expansion in our primary market  mercer county  should help to build our deposit base and further enhance our liquidity profile 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in lending  investment  deposit and borrowing activities 
we seek to manage our asset and liability portfolios to help reduce any adverse impact on net interest income caused by fluctuating interest rates 
interest rate risk due to a sudden and significant change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings to the extent that the interest rates of assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
accordingly  we actively analyze and manage our interest rate exposures 
the primary goal of our interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk inherent in the balance sheet  determine the level of risk appropriate given our strategic objectives and manage the risk consistent with the board of directors approved limits and guidelines 
these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both short and long term time horizons 
our asset and liability and investment committees meet monthly to discuss pertinent asset and liability issues 
on a quarterly basis  management provides a detailed review of our interest rate risk position to the board of directors 
our interest rate risk  and the related risk to net interest income  is derived from the difference in the maturity and repricing characteristics between assets and liabilities 
in  time deposits  which represented over of ynb s deposit base at december   repriced significantly lower throughout the year based on the aggressive lowering of short term rates by the federal reserve in and the maturity characteristics of time deposits 
the liability sensitive position of the balance sheet in the first half of resulted in increased net interest income levels 
we control interest rate risk by identifying and quantifying interest rate risk exposures using simulation and economic value risk models  as well as a simpler gap analysis described below 
we currently do not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  but may do so in the future to mitigate interest rate risk 
one measure of interest rate risk is the gap ratio  which is defined as the difference between the dollar volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified period of time as a percentage of total assets 
a positive gap results when the volume of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds that of interest rate sensitive liabilities within comparable time periods 
a negative gap results when the volume of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds that of interest rate sensitive assets within comparable time periods 
the following table sets forth certain information at december  relating to ynb s assets and liabilities by scheduled repricing for adjustable assets and liabilities  or by contractual maturity for fixed rate assets and liabilities 
rate sensitive assets and liabilities december  six more than more than more than more than under months one year two years five years ten years six through through through through and not in thousands months one year two years five years ten years repricing total assets cash and due from banks   federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits   available for sale securities        investment securities      loans        other assets  net    total assets        liabilities and stockholders equity non interest bearing demand   savings and interest bearing demand     money markets    certificates of deposit of  or more      other time deposits      total deposits       borrowed funds     trust preferred securities    other liabilities   stockholders equity   total liabilities and stockholders equity        gap       cumulative gap      cumulative gap to total assets as indicated in the table on the preceding page  our one year gap position at december  was a positive 
generally  a financial institution with a positive gap position will most likely experience an increase in net interest income during periods of rising rates and decreases in net interest income during periods of falling interest rates 
included in the analysis of our gap position are certain savings deposits  money markets and interest checking accounts  which are less sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates than other interest bearing sources of funds 
in determining the sensitivity of such deposits  we review the recent movement last months of deposit rates relative to market rates 
historically  we have used regression analysis to determine deposit sensitivity  but due to the sudden and significant drop in the last two years  recent patterns are considered a more accurate tool 
the negative gap in the one year timeframe turned positive in the third quarter of the change in our gap position resulted from a combination of a longer liability structure and at the same time a shorter asset structure 
liability durations were primarily driven longer by two year term cds resulting from deposit promotions in new markets and the purchase of fhlb advances with five year lockout periods 
on the asset side  the acceleration in actual and expected prepayment speeds in addition to securities sales shortened asset durations 
the one year cumulative gap position policy guideline is measured as a percentage of assets within a range 
at december   the gap position was within the policy guideline 
while gap analysis represents a useful asset liability management tool  it may not necessarily indicate the effect of interest rate movements on our net interest income due to discretionary repricing of some assets and liabilities  balance sheet options  and other competitive pressures 
simulation analysis involves dynamically modeling our interest income and expenses over specified time periods under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
we use simulation analysis primarily to measure the sensitivity of net interest income over and month time horizons  based on assumptions approved by the asset and liability committee and ratified by the board of directors 
in ynb s base case sensitivity scenario using a static balance sheet  the model measures the variance from a flat or unchanging rate environment in net interest income with a change in interest rates of plus and minus basis points over a month period and a continuation of rates at that level for the second year 
we utilized a minus basis point scenario due to the low interest rate environment that existed at year end 
the plus and minus base case scenario is measured within a policy guideline of change in net interest income in year one and change in year two 
to measure the change in interest rates  the following table reflects the estimated exposure of ynb s net interest income in the base case scenario measured for a two year period beginning january   based on the december  balance sheet percentage change in net interest income change in market interest rates basis points flat basis points the actions we have taken during have resulted in a more balanced interest rate risk position over the next and month period 
from an asset perspective  we have taken actions to protect net interest income in the policy simulation or base case scenario 
interest rate floors have been instituted on the majority of our floating rate commercial loan assets 
should interest rates move lower  income from these earning assets will not decline below the floor 
the repositioning of our investment portfolio  previously discussed  will provide additional income in a rising interest rate environment 
ynb s net interest income will benefit most from a gradually higher interest rate environment in our simulation results indicate that  if interest rates increase  net interest income will improve by approximately in if interest rates decrease  net interest income decreases by approximately in we also measure  through simulation analysis  the impact to net interest income based on projected balance sheet growth scenarios in addition to rate ramps greater than over and month periods 
there are several factors that management evaluates when constructing short term and longer term interest rate risk models 
there is uncertainty regarding the maturity  repricing and runoff characteristics of some of our assets and liabilities 
money market deposits  for example  have no contractual maturity  meaning customers have the ability to add or withdraw funds from these deposit accounts freely 
these deposits may fluctuate unexpectedly due to changes in market rates or even competitive factors 
accordingly  rates on money market deposits may have to be increased more or reduced less than expected 
given the uncertainties of deposit composition or repricing characteristics  the interest rate sensitivity of bank deposits cannot be calculated precisely 
this uncertainty also reflects options embedded in financial instruments  which include mortgage backed securities  callable bonds and fhlb advances 
to deal with the many uncertainties when constructing either short or longer term interest rate risk measurements  management has developed a number of assumptions 
depending on the product or behavior in question  each assumption will reflect some combination of market data  research analysis and business judgment 
assumptions are reviewed periodically with changes made when appropriate 
we also measure longer term interest rate risk through the economic value of equity eve model 
this model involves projecting future cash flows from ynb s current assets and liabilities over a longer time horizon  discounting those cash flows at appropriate interest rates  and then aggregating the discounted cash flows 
our eve is the estimated net present value of these discounted cash flows 
the variance in the economic value of equity is measured as a percentage of the present value of equity 
the sensitivity of eve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the sensitivity of long term earnings to changes in interest rates 
we use the sensitivity of eve principally to measure the exposure of equity to changes in interest rates over a relatively long time horizon 
the following table lists ynb s percentage change in eve in a plus or minus basis point rate shock at december  and due to the low interest rate environment in and  not all interest rates could be shocked basis points 
based on the underlying assumptions used percentage change in eve change in market interest rates rate shock basis points basis points our longer term interest rate risk profile has improved in and now reflects a more balanced position in the event of an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
the addition of new capital in late had a positive impact to the measurements 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the previously discussed interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in the simulation and eve analysis require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  although these models provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of change in market interest rates on ynb s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
we believe that more likely scenarios include gradual changes in interest rate levels 
we continue to monitor our gap and rate shock analyses to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on assets  sell securities  enter into derivative financial instruments  or seek funding sources with different repricing characteristics in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk 
stockholders equity and capital resources the management of capital in a regulated environment requires a balance between earning the highest return for stockholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels for proper risk management  satisfying regulatory requirements  and for future expansion 
our proactive capital management is designed to assure that we are always well capitalized as defined by regulatory authorities and have the necessary capital for our expansion plans 
on december   we completed the sale of million shares of our common stock in an underwritten common stock offering 
the common stock was sold at a price of per share and generated gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds after underwriting and other offering expenses were million  of which million was contributed to the bank to support asset growth 
stockholders equity at december  totaled million compared to million at december  this represents an increase of million or 
this increase resulted from earnings of million  net proceeds of million from the public common stock offering  proceeds of  from exercised stock options  a positive adjustment to equity of million related to the improvement in market value of securities available for sale  proceeds of  from allocated esop shares  and an increase of  associated with the fair market value adjustment related to the allocation of shares from the esop  offset by cash dividend payments of million and treasury shares acquired at an aggregate price of  on august   we completed the private placement of  shares of common stock 
the shares were sold to a limited number of accredited investors at an aggregate purchase price of approximately million and net proceeds of million 
we have an employee stock ownership plan esop that permits eligible employees to share in the growth of ynb through stock ownership 
initiated in  we initially sold  shares to the esop for million 
the esop financed the stock purchase with a nonaffiliated financial institution 
the financing is for a term of five years with an interest rate of with a maturity date of december  the full balance of the loan will be repaid in equal installments over the term of the loan 
the shares purchased by the esop were used as collateral for the loan 
the balance of unallocated esop shares at december  was  the annual expenses associated with the esop were  in   in and  in these expenses include compensation expense  debt service on the loan and any adjustment required due to changes in the fair value of the shares at time of allocation

recent accounting pronouncements in december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the additional disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ended after december  the company has adopted the expanded disclosure provisions of this statement effective december  in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation requires that the bank recognize the fair value of guarantee and indemnification arrangements issued or modified by the bank after december   if these arrangements are within the scope of that interpretation 
in addition  under previously existing generally accepted accounting principles  the bank continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to the guarantees and indemnifications to identify whether it is probable that a loss has occurred  and would recognize any such losses under the guarantees and indemnifications when those losses are estimable 
management does not anticipate that the initial adoption of fin will have a significant impact on the bank s financial statements 
critical accounting policies the disclosures included in this annual report are based on our audited consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including the adequacy of allowances for loan losses 
we believe our policies with respect to the determination of the allowance for loan losses involve a high degree of complexity and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
estimates are based upon historical experience  current economic conditions and other factors that we consider reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates result in judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities where these values are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements under summary of significant accounting policies
