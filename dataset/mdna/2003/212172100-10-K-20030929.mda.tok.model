item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a provider of integrated outpatient healthcare and home health services in florida 
as of june   we operated  owned and or managed fifteen staff model clinics in south and central florida  a pop based independent practice association ipa with six physicians  and five home health agencies 
in april  we entered into an agreement with an hmo to provide management services in connection with the oversight of physician groups on a no risk basis 
as of june   we managed approximately physicians under the terms of this agreement 
our managed care operations  which include the staff model clinics and the ipa  provide healthcare services to some of the nation s largest managed care organizations  including i humana for which we provided managed care services for approximately  and  member months members per month multiplied by the months for which services were available during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and ii vista  for which we provided managed care services for approximately  member months during both fiscal and fiscal at june   we were providing care on a full risk basis for approximately  and  patients for humana and vista  respectively 
at june   we were providing care on a full risk basis for approximately  and  patients for humana and vista  respectively 
our home health operations provide home health services to recovering  disabled  chronically ill and terminally ill patients in their home 
accounting policies general the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to our hmo agreements  accounts receivable  intangible assets and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
please refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements  particularly note  for a more detailed description of such policies 
revenue recognition revenue is recorded in the period services are rendered as determined by the respective contract 
under our full risk contracts with hmos  we receive a percentage of premium for each patient that chooses one of our physicians as their primary care physician and we assume responsibility for the cost of all medical services 
to the extent that patients require more frequent or expensive care  our revenue under a contract may be insufficient to cover the costs of care provided 
when it is probable that expected future health care costs and maintenance costs under a contract or group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated pop revenue on those contracts  we recognize losses on our prepaid healthcare services with hmos 
no contracts are considered loss contracts at june  because we have the right to terminate unprofitable physicians and close unprofitable centers under our managed care contracts 

table of contents under our limited risk and no risk contracts with hmos  we receive a management fee based on the number of patients for which we are providing services on a monthly basis 
the management fee is recorded as revenue in the period in which services are provided 
we record our medical services revenue for the treatment of individuals covered by medicare  medicaid and other contracted reimbursement programs based on the cost of services provided or predetermined rates  which are generally less than the established billing rates of our facilities 
reimbursement rates relating to these receivables  particularly governmental receivables  are complex and change frequently 
we base our determination of the amount to record as medical services revenue on historical experience  however  final determination of amounts received from medicare and medicaid is subject to review and audit by the appropriate agencies 
these estimates could be affected by a number of factors  including changes in legislation or results of audits of our cost reports 
differences between amounts recorded as estimated settlements and the audited amounts are reflected as adjustments to revenues in the period the final determination is made 
recording the cost of health care services the cost of health care services provided or contracted for is accrued in the period in which the services are provided 
management estimates medical claims expense and the related liability for medical claims incurred but not reported each month based on historical claims incurred per member per month 
we adjust our estimate if we have unusually high or low inpatient utilization 
we compare the estimated expense recorded in prior months to actual claims expense as claims are paid by the hmo and reported to us and adjust our estimates accordingly 
our estimate also considers annual changes in the benefits covered by the hmo plans 
if benefit changes are expected to significantly increase or reduce our claims exposure  we apply a trend factor to the historical claims experience 
this monthly calculation produces what we believe is the best estimate of medical claims expense and the related liability for medical claims incurred but not reported 
to further corroborate our estimate of medical claims  an independent actuarial calculation is performed on a quarterly basis 
this independent actuarial calculation indicates that medical claims incurred but not reported as of june  are between approximately  and  as of june   we had recorded a liability of approximately  for medical claims incurred but not reported  including the medical claims incurred but not yet reported for discontinued operations  based on our monthly calculation process 
as the amount recorded was within the actuarial range  no further analysis was necessary 
consideration of impairment of costs in excess of net tangible assets our balance sheet includes intangible assets  including goodwill and separately identifiable intangible assets 
effective july   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives to their estimated residual values and also reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise 
indicators of an impairment include  among other things  significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate  loss of a key hmo contract  an adverse action by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel or allocation of goodwill to a portion of business that is to be sold 
as we operate in a single segment of business  that of managing the provision of outpatient health care and health care related services in the state of florida  management has determined that we have a single reporting unit and perform our impairment test for goodwill on an enterprise level 
in performing the impairment test  we compare our fair value  as determined by the current market value of our common stock  to the current carrying value of the total net assets  including goodwill and intangible assets 
we perform our annual impairment test on may st of each year 
should we determine that an indicator of impairment has occurred  such as those noted above  we would be required to perform an additional impairment test which could result in the determination that a portion of our intangible assets are impaired and must be written off 
depending on the market value of our common stock at the time that an impairment test is required  there is a risk that a portion of our intangible assets would be considered impaired and must be written off during that period 

table of contents results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations

table of contents the financial results discussed below relate to our operations for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  revenue from continuing operations medical services revenue for fiscal increased to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of increases in the number of medicare members from whom we receive pop revenue and increases in the premium revenue per member 
additionally  on september   we were notified by our medicare fiscal intermediary that they had completed the reopening of the rms cost report which resulted in the original liability of approximately  being reduced to approximately  as a result  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded an adjustment of approximately  as a medicare cost report settlement  which is included in net medical services revenue

our claims loss ratio varies due to fluctuations in utilization  medical costs and premium revenues 
other direct costs include the salaries and benefits of health professionals providing primary care and home health services  capitation payments to our contracted primary care ipa physicians  and other costs necessary to provide medical services to our patients 
other direct costs were approximately  and  during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  or and of medical services revenues 
payroll and employee benefits for administrative personnel was approximately  or of total revenue during fiscal compared to approximately  or of total revenue during fiscal the increase in payroll and employee benefits during fiscal is primarily due to the following i director compensation of  ii the filling of the general counsel position which had been vacant for nine months in fiscal  and iii annual salary increases and bonuses 
general and administrative expenses during fiscal were approximately  or of total revenue compared to approximately  or of total revenue during fiscal during fiscal  we adjusted the accruals for various liabilities  including a settlement for a liability related to a closed subsidiary 
the adjustment of these liabilities resulted in a reduction of approximately  of general and administrative 
table of contents expenses during fiscal no similar transaction occurred during fiscal additionally  in fiscal  we experienced an increase in our liability insurance premiums of approximately  depreciation and amortization for fiscal decreased approximately to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the decrease is due primarily to certain intangible assets which became fully amortized during fiscal income from operations income from operations for fiscal was approximately  or of total revenues  compared to approximately  or of total revenues for fiscal these results include a loss from our home health operations of approximately  in fiscal compared to a loss of approximately  in fiscal  before allocating any corporate overhead expenses

interest expense during fiscal consisted primarily of approximately  related to amortization of deferred financing costs  approximately  of imputed interest expense on non interest bearing notes  interest expense of approximately  on our credit facility and interest expense of approximately  related to various notes payable 
provision for medicare settlement related to terminated operations the provision for medicare settlement related to terminated operations recorded during fiscal  relates to alleged overpayments by cms to a former subsidiary 
on february   we acquired the stock of rehab management systems  inc  integracare  inc 
and jr rehab associates  inc 
from integrated health services  inc rms operated numerous rehabilitation clinics in the states of florida  georgia  alabama  north carolina and south carolina as a medicare and medicaid provider of outpatient services 
on april   we sold substantially all the assets of rms and the assumption of certain liabilities to kessler rehabilitation of florida  inc on august   rms was formally dissolved as a corporation with the state of florida 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we became aware that cms was pursuing ihs  kessler and rms for collection of principal and interest for certain alleged medicare overpayments made to providers purchased from ihs or linked to the purchased entities through the use of a common provider number for services rendered during calendar years  and we were aware of our obligation to cms for any overpayments for services rendered by the providers during calendar years and at the time the cost reports were completed and submitted to cms for services rendered by the providers during calendar years and  we recorded an estimate for the overpayments indicated on those cost reports as part of our continuing operations 
when we purchased rms  the purchase agreement included indemnification from ihs for any overpayments prior to calendar year subsequent to our purchase of rms  ihs sought protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code and  as such  is protected from cms and rms efforts to collect on the alleged overpayments that relate to calendar year during the third quarter of fiscal  it became clear that we were being pursued by cms as the primary obligor for all of the alleged overpayments  including calendar year while we dispute the validity of these claims  in an effort to expedite the resolution of these matters and halt cms aggressive collection procedures which included the threat of withholding payments to our home health agencies  we entered into a memorandum of understanding for the and cost report years the repayment memorandum and the repayment memorandum 
under both the repayment memorandum and the repayment memorandum  we agreed to make monthly payments of  for months for each of the and cost report years with the balance due at the end of the respective terms 
although we began making payments under these memorandums  we retained the right to dispute the alleged overpayments 
while a liability for the cost 
table of contents report had previously been recorded  no amounts had been recorded for the cost report liability primarily due to i the indemnification we had received from ihs for any overpayments prior to calendar year  ii the cost report including providers which we never owned or operated  and iii lack of knowledge of a balance owed to cms for the cost report and cms ability to demand payment from us 
as such  during the quarter ended march  we recorded an approximately  provision for medicare settlement related to terminated operations 
during september  we requested a reopening of the and cost reports and supplied various documentation to demonstrate that the alleged overpayments are incorrect 
on april  the medicare fiscal intermediary notified us of their intent to reopen the and cost reports and review the documentation we submitted 
on september   the medicare fiscal intermediary notified us that they have completed the reopening of the cost report and they are currently reviewing the documentation we submitted for the cost report reopening 
there can be no assurance that the cost report reopening will result in a positive adjustment or reduce the liability outstanding 
see note commitments and contingencies 
income loss from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations was approximately  during fiscal as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of approximately  during fiscal effective january   we terminated the medicare and medicaid lines of business for all of the physician contracts associated with one of our independent practice associations the terminated vista ipa 
the terminated vista ipa  which consisted of physicians at the time of the termination and is considered discontinued operations  contributed approximately  and  in medical services revenue during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
while this termination was intended to streamline our cost structure and stem anticipated operating losses  we may not achieve any financial benefits as a result of terminating these ipa contracts

claims expense was approximately  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  or and of medical services revenues derived from our managed care services during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our claims loss ratio varies due to fluctuations in utilization  medical costs and premium revenues 
medical claims as a percentage of revenues declined in fiscal  primarily due to decreased utilization and various benefit changes instituted by the hmos that became effective january   such as requiring copayments for certain prescription drugs in selected counties in which we operate 
these positive trends were offset  to some extent  in the fourth quarter by an increase in the cost of stop loss insurance provided by vista for our medicare members of approximately per member per month 
other direct costs include the salaries and benefits of health professionals providing primary care and home health services  capitation payments to our contracted primary care ipa physicians  and other costs necessary to provide medical services to our patients

additionally  certain tangible assets became fully depreciated and other intangible assets became fully amortized during fiscal depreciation and amortization expense during fiscal was reduced by approximately  for these fully depreciated and amortized assets 
gain on extinguishment of debt effective june   we completed a restructuring the fiscal restructuring of our convertible subordinated notes and as a result recorded a gain on the extinguishment of debt of approximately  the gain resulted primarily from the conversion of  of the outstanding principal balance into  shares of common stock  which were valued at approximately  based on the closing price of our common stock on june   the recording of approximately  of interest which will accrue on the remaining balance of the notes under the revised terms of the agreement through the maturity date of october   the recording of a new note payable the new note in the amount of  and the recording of approximately  of interest which will accrue on the new note 
we have not provided for income taxes on the gain because we believe we will be able to utilize certain of our net operating loss carryforwards to offset any income tax liability related to this transaction 
income loss from operations income from operations for fiscal was approximately  or 
of total revenues  compared to a loss from operations of approximately  or of total revenues for fiscal these results include

provision for medicare settlement related to terminated operations as discussed above  the provision for medicare settlement related to terminated operations recorded during fiscal of approximately  relates to alleged overpayments by cms to a former subsidiary 
also see note to our consolidated financial statements 
loss income from discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations was approximately  during fiscal as compared to income from discontinued operations of approximately  during fiscal effective january   we terminated the medicare and medicaid lines of business for all of the physician contracts associated with one of our independent practice associations 
the terminated vista ipa  which consisted of physicians at the time of the termination and is considered discontinued operations  contributed approximately  and  in medical services revenue during fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in medical services revenue of approximately from fiscal to fiscal resulted from an amendment to this ipa contract the amendment 
among other things  the amendment terminated our association with certain physician practices effective april  through may   which represented approximately of this ipa s membership at that time  and eliminated the medical claims liability incurred by the ipa through march  and reduced other liabilities to the hmo 
as a result  we recorded a contractual revision of previously recorded medical claims and other liabilities of approximately  in fiscal the ipa s member months were approximately  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
net loss net loss for fiscal was approximately  compared to a net loss of approximately  for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our auditors opinion on the june  consolidated financial statements states that  although our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  there is a significant uncertainty as to whether we will be able to fund our obligations and satisfy our debt obligations as they become due in fiscal at june   our working capital deficit was approximately  our total indebtedness accounted for approximately of our total capitalization and we had principal and interest of approximately  outstanding under our credit facility 

table of contents our credit facility matures on march   is personally guaranteed by one of our principal shareholders see note to our consolidated financial statements  contains  among other things  a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of to beginning december  and measured quarterly thereafter and is collateralized by all of our assets 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to meet this financial covenant at december  or be able to maintain it as required by the credit facility 
our failure to satisfy this financial covenant could result in a default under our credit facility 
if a default occurs under our credit facility  the lender could elect to declare all our outstanding borrowings  as well as accrued interest  to be due and payable and require us to apply our available cash to repay these borrowings 
based on our current cash flow projections  it appears unlikely that we will have sufficient funds available to fully repay the credit facility on or before march  additionally  uncertainty exists as to whether we will be able to extend or replace the credit facility without extending the personal guarantee of our principal shareholder or finding replacement guarantees  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such guarantees 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our attempts to either repay  extend or replace the credit facility and  if so  if this will occur on terms acceptable to us 
on march   we modified the terms of our convertible subordinated notes payable 
the noteholders extended the principal payment of  which was due on october  to october  in consideration for this modification to the notes  we issued an aggregate of  shares of restricted stock to the noteholders and increased the annual interest rate on the deferred principal payment from to 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
in april  we executed a physician group participation agreement with one of our hmo partners 
pursuant to the pgp agreement  we will assume certain management responsibilities on a non risk basis for the hmo s medicare  commercial and medicaid members assigned to selected primary care physicians in miami dade and broward counties of florida 
revenue from this contract consists of a monthly management fee designed to cover our costs for providing these services 
simultaneously with the execution of the pgp agreement  we restructured the terms of a  contract modification note with the hmo 
pursuant to the restructuring  the contract modification note was cancelled 
the pgp agreement is for a period of two years and contains a provision for liquidated damages in the amount of  which can be asserted by the hmo in the event that i continued participation by us under this pgp agreement may affect adversely the health  safety or welfare of a member or bring the hmo or its provider networks into disrepute  ii we engage in or acquiesce to any act of bankruptcy  receivership or reorganization  iii we are excluded from participation in any federal healthcare program  iv the hmo determines that we have not used our best efforts to perform under the pgp agreement  or v we materially breach the pgp agreement 
because there are contingent circumstances under which future payments to the hmo for liquidated damages could exceed the amount of debt forgiven  the gain to be recognized from the extinguishment of debt will be deferred and recognized when the liquidated damages are less than the debt forgiven 
if we remain in compliance with the terms of the pgp agreement  humana  at its option  may reduce the liquidated damages by one fourth on each of the following dates october   april   october  and april  if we obtain these reductions  the deferred revenue will be recognized in a manner consistent with the reduction in the liquidated damages 
the deferred gain on extinguishment of debt is shown as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain reductions in the liquidated damages or that humana will not determine that one of the above events has occurred and assert a claim against us for liquidated damages 
in fiscal  we continued to review our operations and institute measures intended to operate profitably and reduce a significant working capital deficiency that resulted from losses incurred in prior years 
in spite of the measures we have instituted  our home health agencies have continued to experience significant increases in their direct and indirect costs while their revenues have decreased 
this has resulted in home health operating losses in fiscal   and of approximately   and  respectively  before consideration of interest expense 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to reorganize the home health agencies in an effort to reduce their overhead costs and began to explore new payor sources to increase patient referrals 
during fiscal  the claims loss ratio for our managed care operations has stabilized 
however  negative changes in the claims loss ratio  due to increases in the utilization of healthcare services as well as increases in medical costs without counterbalancing increases in premium revenues from our contracts with health maintenance organizations hmos  would reduce the profitability and cash flows from our managed care operations 
see our physician group practices contracts require us to assume the responsibility of providing medicare to our managed care patients 
historically  we have been able to realize advantageous hmo benefit 
table of contents changes and premium increases in our managed care operations in the third quarter of our fiscal year  which have a positive impact on profitability and cash flow 
however  there can be no assurance that any benefit changes will occur or be realized in the third quarter of fiscal or that premium increases  if any  will be able to offset any negative health cost trends 
if in fiscal we are unable to reduce our home health losses by increasing our referrals and reducing our indirect cost and are unable to maintain our current claims loss ratio for our managed care operations  these factors  compounded by the lack of availability of additional financing through the credit facility and the need to make annual payments for medical malpractice insurance which are due in the first and second quarters of fiscal  will result in a severe strain on our cash flow 
there can be no assurances that our efforts to reorganize the home health operations or any potential benefit changes or premium increases in our managed care operations will allow us to meet our cash requirements in fiscal at june   we have payments due on our long term debt  capital lease obligations  and contractual obligations as follows payment due by period total less than year years years long term debt obligations credit facility convertible subordinated notes payable  including capitalized interest related party notes payable  including capitalized interest capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total the payments shown above for our convertible subordinated notes payable and related party notes payable include interest that was capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the payments shown above for capital lease obligations and operating lease obligations reflect all payments due under the terms of the respective leases 
see note to our consolidated financial statements to reconcile the payments shown above to the capital lease obligation recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements and have not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated  limited purpose entities or commodity contracts 
we plan to fund our capital commitments  operating cash requirements and satisfy our obligations from a combination of cash on hand and operating cash flow improvements realized through decreased utilization  hmo premium increases  advantageous hmo benefit changes from our managed care operations and reducing indirect costs and increasing patient referrals for our home health agencies 
we continue to focus on strengthening our managed care operations by enhancing our physician network  streamlining our operations and implementing measures to contain the rising costs of providing health services to our members 
such measures include  among other things  emphasizing preventive care  encouraging frequent health check ups  monitoring compliance with drug therapies  entering into our own contracts with health care providers such as medical specialists and recommending that our members utilize hospitals and outpatient facilities that have favorable rate structures 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we began to reorganize our home health agencies in an effort to reduce their overhead costs and began exploring new payor sources to increase patient referrals 
if we can not maintain our current claims loss ratio for our managed care operations or reduce the home health losses  our business  results of operations  and cash flow may be materially adversely affected and we may be unable to meet our financial obligations as they become due 
if we are unable to satisfy our cash requirements  we may be required to take certain steps  such as borrowing additional funds  restructuring our indebtedness  selling assets  selling equity  reducing or delaying capital 
table of contents expenditures or payments to trade creditors and forgoing certain business opportunities 
if we need additional capital to repay our obligations or fund operations  there can be no assurances that such capital can be obtained or  if obtained  that it will be on terms acceptable to us 
the incurring or assumption of additional indebtedness could result in the issuance of additional equity and or debt which can have a dilutive effect on current shareholders and a significant effect on our operations 
our net income from continuing operations was approximately  for fiscal net cash provided by continuing operations was approximately  the following were the most significant items which are reflected in our net loss but did not affect our cash flows from operations depreciation and amortization  including the amortization of deferred loan costs  reduced net income by approximately  without reducing cash from operations 
the net increase in due to from medicare was approximately  this increase reflects the following i the transfer of amounts due to medicare for overpayments in prior years for filed cost reports to long term debt upon agreement of repayment terms with cms  ii a decrease in due from medicare for amounts due to us for filed cost reports for prior years  iii an increase in the due from medicare as a result of the settlement of the rms cost report reopening  and iv an increase in the receivable from medicare generated from current home health operations 
the transfer of amounts due to medicare to long term debt did not impact our loss from continuing operations and did not require a cash outflow from operations 
the decrease in due from medicare for amounts due to us for filed cost reports for prior years did not impact our loss from continuing operations but did provide cash 
the increase in the receivable from medicare resulting from the settlement of the rms cost report reopening reduced our loss from continuing operations but did not increase cash flows from operations 
the increase in the receivable from medicare for current operations reduced our loss from continuing operations but did not impact the cash flows from continuing operations 
the increase in patient receivables of approximately  reduced our net loss  but did not provide cash in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded  in director compensation which was paid through the issuance of  shares of restricted common stock 
this director compensation reduced income from continuing operations without reducing cash from operations 
the following were significant items that affected our cash flows but did not affect our net income decreases in other receivables of approximately  provided cash from operations but did not affect our net loss in fiscal decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately  used cash from operations but did not affect our net loss in fiscal our net receivable from hmos decreased by approximately  provided cash in fiscal  but did not impact our net loss 
cash used by discontinued operations was approximately  for fiscal our cash used in investing activities was approximately  for fiscal  includes approximately  primarily for the purchase of equipment and  for the purchase of a certificate of deposit offset by approximately  in maturities of restricted cash 
our cash used in financing activities was approximately  primarily due to payments of various notes payable 
the balanced budget act of directed the health care financing administration now cms to replace the existing system of risk adjustment  which previously relied solely on demographic factors  with one that took enrollees health status into account the medicare risk adjustment or mra 
the demographic only portion of the payment was adjusted for age  gender  medicaid eligibility  institutional status and working aged status 
the revised mra portion of the payment  however  includes these same categories but adds health status as a 
table of contents new criteria 
such health status is measured by the previous medical costs for inpatient hospital stays incurred by the individual 
these are then used to determine each individual s expected future medical risk and  therefore  how much the health plan in which they are enrolled should be paid 
to ensure that health plans had time to adjust to the new payment method  cms built a five year transition period into the mra methodology it adopted 
the initial data used to facilitate the transition to mra was based solely upon inpatient hospital encounter data 
for and  under the balanced budget refinement act of bbra the transition to risk adjustment was based upon a blend percentage consisting of risk adjustment payment and on the adjustment for demographic factors 
for  the blend percentage was adjusted to risk adjustment payment and on the adjustment for demographic factors 
the law requires that the ambulatory data be incorporated beginning january   at which time the blend percentage will consist of risk adjustment payment and on the adjustment for demographic factors 
in  the blend percentage will consist of risk adjustment payment and on the adjustment for demographic factors 
in  the blend percentage will consist of risk adjustment payment and on the adjustment for demographic factors 
in  the blend percentage will consist of risk adjustment payment and on the adjustment for demographic factors 
through fiscal  our payments from the hmos have substantially been based on the demographic model 
however  in fiscal  we anticipate that the payments we receive from the hmos will begin reflecting the mra methodology 
at this time  it cannot be determined if this impact will be favorable or unfavorable 
approximately of our medical services revenue from continuing operations during fiscal was derived from our hhas 
effective october   two of our hhas  which primarily provide services to patients eligible under the medicare program  began to be reimbursed by medicare under the prospective payment system 
under pps  we are paid a predetermined fee for services provided to patients for every day period for which care is rendered 
any reduction in reimbursement under a pps predetermined fee schedule would have a negative impact on our business  results of operations and cash flow 
prior to the implementation of pps  our hhas were reimbursed for services provided based on a reasonable cost methodology 
we were reimbursed for cost reimbursable items at a tentative rate with final settlement determined after submission of annual cost reports and subsequent audits by cms 
changes in the estimated settlements we recorded may be adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined and may have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and cash flow 
see note of our consolidated financial statements regarding amounts currently due to cms 
one of our hmo contracts requires that we fund a claims reserve fund for certain of our staff model clinics 
as a result of increased membership  our obligations under this reserve fund increased by approximately  effective may   and will be paid over five months 
at june  the unfunded portion of this required reserve was approximately  the hmo can only draw upon this reserve in the event that the staff model clinics in question have incurred an account deficit and that we are unable or unwilling to satisfy the hmos demand to fund the deficit 
at no time during fiscal were the staff model clinics in question in an account deficit position 
other factors that could affect our liquidity and cash flow are discussed elsewhere in this annual report  including risk factors and include i increasing costs of health care services  ii loss of a material contract  iii decreases in reimbursement rates by third party payors  iv retroactive cost report adjustments  v adverse governmental regulation  vi damage awards under pending or future litigation  and vii increased insurance costs 
on july   the american stock exchange notified us it had completed its review of our listing qualifications and has accepted our plan to regain compliance with continued listing standards by december  the plan includes quarterly milestones which  as of the date of the filing of this annual report  we have not met 
if we do not show progress in obtaining these milestones or if we are unable to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by december   our common stock may be delisted from the exchange 
as of the date of this filing  we are still below the continued listing requirements of the exchange with respect to requirements which include the need for us to maintain stockholders equity of at least million and not sustain losses from continuing operations and or net losses in three of our four most recent fiscal years 
we are unable to guarantee that the exchange will continue to list our common stock 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at june   our cash equivalents were invested in high grade  very short term securities  which are not typically subject to material market risk 
we have loans outstanding at fixed rates 
for loans with fixed interest rates  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments and would have an immaterial impact on the fair value of these instruments 
our credit facility is interest rate sensitive 
a basis point adverse movement increase in interest rates would have increased the net loss for fiscal and fiscal by approximately  and  respectively 
we have no material risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices
