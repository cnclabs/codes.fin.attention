item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations sales revenue consolidated sales revenue for the year ended december   was million compared to million in  a decrease of approximately percent 
sales revenue increased approximately percent in compared to million in during  the decrease in sales revenue is primarily due to several international markets experiencing declining sales revenue as a result of import restrictions  political unrest and currency devaluation 
during  the change in sales revenue is related to the growth of our international operations 
we distribute our products to consumers through an independent sales force comprised of managers and distributors 
active managers totaled approximately   and  at december   and  respectively 
active distributors totaled approximately   and  at december   and  respectively 
we anticipate the number of active distributors to increase as we expand our existing operations  enter new international markets and as current distributors grow their businesses 
sales revenue related to the united states operations decreased slightly in to million compared to million in sales revenue increased slightly for  compared to million in price increases of percent in our united states market went into effect in both and  and resulted in greater sales revenue for these years 
a price increase of approximately percent  primarily associated with increased raw material costs  is scheduled to become effective on april  management believes this price increase in its united states market will be acceptable to its sales force and will result in increased sales revenue 
international sales revenue decreased to million in compared to million in  a decrease of approximately percent 
sales revenue increased approximately percent in compared to million in price increases are planned in various international markets to adjust for foreign currency devaluations and increases in the cost of finished products 
management believes the price increases will be acceptable to its sales force and will result in increased sales revenue 
during  our operations in south korea and venezuela experienced decreases of approximately million in sales revenue as compared to the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in south korea was due to increased competition for our distributors 
the decrease in sales revenue in venezuela is primarily due to political unrest and currency devaluation 
sales revenue for  and in our operations in brazil were million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in sales revenue was due to import regulations imposed by the brazilian government 
we expect these new regulations to continue to adversely impact sales revenue and operating results during further information related to the united states and international segments is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
costs and expenses our costs and expenses  which include cost of goods sold  volume incentives  and selling  general and administrative  are identified as a percent of sales in the table below year ended december cost of goods sold volume incentives selling  general and administrative cost of goods sold cost of goods sold as a percent of sales decreased in as compared to  primarily as a result of decreased importation costs in several of our international operations as well as increased efficiency gained from our new manufacturing facility 
cost of goods sold increased as a percent of sales in as compared to  as a result of increased importation costs in several of the company s international operations  most notably brazil 
management believes that cost of goods sold as a percent of sales will remain relatively constant during as compared to volume incentives volume incentives are a significant part of our direct sales marketing program and represent payments made to its independent distributors and managers 
these payments are designed to provide incentives for reaching higher sales levels and for recruiting additional distributors 
volume incentives as a percent of sales increased slightly during as compared to and decreased slightly in as compared to  primarily as a result of the change in international sales revenue where volume incentives are slightly lower than in our united states operations 
management expects volume incentives as a percent of sales to remain relatively constant during as compared to due to our international operations 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to an increase of million in and an increase of million in  primarily as a result of incentive and promotional programs in the united states and international operations designed to increase distributor recruitment and increase sales revenue  as well as additional selling  general and administrative expenses associated with synergy  a direct marketing company involved in the distribution and sale of high quality nutritional  personal care and other products with an emphasis on the asian markets 
during  and  selling  general and administrative expenses associated with synergy totaled million  million and million  respectively 
selling  general and administrative as a percent of sales increased to percent in compared to percent in and percent in this category includes costs for research and development  distribution and incentive programs such as our conventions 
we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales will decrease during as compared to due to cost control measures  including the impact of a hiring freeze instituted in march  in the united states operations 
in our international operations reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses are planned in our synergy  south korea  japan and brazil operations 
other income other income decreased approximately million in as compared to as a result of an impairment of our investment in cetalon corporation of million offset  in part by foreign exchange gains 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was percent for  compared to percent in and in due to significant political and economic difficulties in chile  we dissolved operations in that country and liquidated our assets 
through this process  we realized a tax deduction in the united states for the loss arising from the write off of our investment in chile 
we anticipate our effective tax rate to be slightly higher during as compared to product liability similar to other manufacturers and distributors of products that are ingested  we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that  among other things  the use of its products results in injury 
as a result of increased regulatory scrutiny of products that contain ephedrine alkaloids and kava  we have not been able to obtain product liability insurance covering such products 
approximately percent of our products contain some amount of ephedrine alkaloids and kava 
we carry insurance in the types and amounts we consider reasonably adequate to cover the risks associated with our business 
premiums for our product liability coverage applicable to our products that are insurable increased approximately percent at june   providing significantly less coverage than that of the prior year 
there can be no assurance that product liability insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost if at all  to cover potential liabilities associated with our products 
in the event that product liability claims exceed product liability coverage  the results could have a material negative impact on us 
we are exploring various options to obtain other forms of coverage  including but not limited to  captive plans 
due to our inability to secure product liability insurance on ephedrine alkaloids and kava  we have accrued an amount that management believes is sufficient to cover any potential liability 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we generated cash from operating activities of million compared to million in the decrease in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to reduced net income in compared to  an increase in deferred income tax assets  reductions in accounts payable and accrued volume incentives due to the timing of payments and the impact of translation adjustments on foreign currencies 
capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the high level of capital expenditures in was primarily due to the expansion of the manufacturing  research and development and quality assurance areas of our manufacturing facility 
construction began during the fourth quarter of and was completed during the second quarter of capital expenditures not related to this expansion were primarily for equipment  computer systems and software  office furniture and leasehold improvements made to enhance existing operations as well as the expansion of international markets 
in february  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
the repurchase of these shares was completed in september also in september  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares of our common stock 
as of march   approximately  shares were available to be repurchased under this authorization 
in connection with these board authorized purchases of  shares each  we spent approximately million and million in cash to repurchase common stock in the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we entered into an operating line of credit agreement providing for borrowings of up to million 
the proceeds from this line of credit may be used to repurchase common shares of our outstanding stock under its board authorized repurchase program as well as to fund working capital  capital expenditures and related costs 
as of december   we had an outstanding balance of million on this line of credit 
proceeds from the line of credit were used to purchase approximately  shares of our stock under the repurchase program 
additional information with respect to this line of credit is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
during  we entered into an exclusive  marketing agreement with healthetech  inc  to make available personal health monitoring devices and personalized diet and nutrition software to our managers and distributors 
as part of this agreement  the company purchased approximately million worth of healthetech  inc common stock at fair market value 
during  our wholly owned subsidiary  innovative botanical solutions  inc  entered into an exclusive agreement with cetalon corporation to manufacture a proprietary line of cetalon branded herbs and vitamins 
additionally  innovative botanical solutions purchased approximately million in cetalon common stock 
a loan of million was also provided to cetalon corporation  and an option obtained for innovative botanical solutions to purchase additional shares of cetalon common stock 
during the first quarter of  we determined that our investments in cetalon were impaired and accordingly wrote down the entire investment 
for the year ended december   we used cash of approximately million to purchase certain assets of synergy worldwide  inc synergy 
additional information related to the purchase of certain assets of synergy is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we have certain commitments related to operating leases as set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we believe that our working capital requirements can be met through our available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities for the foreseeable future  however  a prolonged economic downturn or a decrease in the demand for our products could adversely affect our long term liquidity 
in the event of a significant decrease in cash provided by our operating activities  we might need to obtain additional external sources of funding 
we currently maintain an operating line of credit allowing for borrowings of up to million of which million has been borrowed as of december  the proceeds from this line of credit may be used to repurchase common shares  as well as to fund working capital requirements 
we do not currently maintain a long term credit facility or any other external sources of long term funding  however  we believe that such funding could be obtained on competitive terms in the event additional sources of funds become necessary 
the following table summarizes information about contractual obligations as of december  total less than year years years after years line of credit operating leases total contractual obligations key accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
revenue recognition we primarily derive sales revenue from the sale of nutritional and personal care products to independent distributors in the united states and our international operations 
sales revenue and related volume incentives are recorded when the merchandise is shipped to the independent distributor 
orders for our products are typically shipped within hours after receipt 
amounts received for unshipped merchandise are recorded as customer deposits and are included in accrued liabilities 
payments of volume incentives related to product orders are made in the month following the sale 
volume incentives accrual we accrue for expenses associated with volume incentives associated with our sales revenue 
volume incentives are a significant part of our direct sales marketing program and represent payments made to our independent distributors and managers 
we specifically analyze volume incentives based on historical and current sales trends when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued volume incentives 
self insurance liabilities we self insure for certain employee medical and specific product liabilities 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks are calculated using actuarial methods and are not discounted 
the liabilities include amounts for actual claims and claims incurred but not reported 
actual experience  including claim frequency and severity as well as health care inflation  could result in actual liabilities being more or less than the amounts currently recorded 
incentive trip accrual we accrue for expenses associated with incentive trips associated with our direct sales marketing program  which rewards independent distributors and managers with paid attendance at our conventions and meetings 
expenses associated with incentive trips are accrued over qualification periods as they are earned 
we specifically analyze incentive trip accruals based on historical and current sales trends as well as contractual obligations when evaluating the adequacy of the incentive trip accrual 
actual results could result in liabilities being more or less than the amounts recorded 
we have accrued convention and meeting costs of approximately  and  at december  and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct business in several countries and intend to continue to expand its foreign operations 
sales revenue  operating income and net income are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  interest rates and other uncertainties inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency 
in addition  our operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in social  political and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where it has operations as well as  to a lesser extent  changes in united states laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment 
foreign currency risk during the year ended december   approximately percent of our revenue and approximately percent of our expenses were realized outside of the united states 
inventory purchases are transacted primarily in us dollars from vendors located in the united states 
the local currency of each international subsidiary is considered the functional currency  and all revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the periods reported 
therefore  we reported sales and expenses will be positively impacted by a weakening of the us dollar and will be negatively impacted by a strengthening of the us dollar 
given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations  we cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on our future business  product pricing  results of operations or financial condition 
changes in currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which we sell our products 
we regularly monitor our foreign currency risks and periodically take measures to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results 
we do not use derivative instruments for hedging  trading or speculating on foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the following table sets forth average currency exchange rates of one us dollar into local currency for each of the countries in which sales revenue exceeded million during any of the years presented 
year ended december brazil mexico south korea venezuela during  venezuela experienced a significant devaluation in the bolivar  which adversely affected the results of operations 
continued devaluation could adversely affect the results of operations in future periods 
interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by purchasing investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of marketable securities 
at december   we had investments of million of which million were held as municipal obligations  carry an average fixed interest rate of percent and mature over a five year period 
a hypothetical percent change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
our remaining investments of million are not subject to interest rate risk
