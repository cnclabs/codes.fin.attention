the remaining unpaid benefits at december  of million are included in accrued liabilities 
other income other income consists primarily of dividend and interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
the decline in other income in is due to decreased yields in the tax exempt markets as well as less funds available for investment 
write down of other investments other investments include investments made by the company s strategic venture capital group  xr ventures  llc xrv see other investments  below 
each investment represents less than percent of the ownership of the respective investees 
since the company does not exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of each investee  the investments have been recorded at cost 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of each investment to determine whether a decline in fair value below cost has occurred 
if the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value is adjusted to the current fair value and a loss is recognized 
a comprehensive assessment of the continuing value of xrv s investments was performed in june  and the conclusion was reached that due to the continued erosion of the venture capital markets  and network middleware and telecommunications sectors of the economy  the value of certain investments had been permanently impaired 
accordingly  a charge of million was recorded in the second quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  xrv provided a working capital advance of million to a company in which it had previously invested and subsequently expensed that investment 
this new funding was made in conjunction with other previous third party investors 
this funding was intended to provide the investee operating cash for the next six months while it sought new sources of investment capital 
the investee has not been successful in securing new capital  and upon further analysis  this investment was deemed to be impaired and the appropriate charge was taken in the fourth quarter 
the company performed a similar assessment in the fourth quarter of  and it was determined that certain investments had been permanently impaired requiring a write down of million 
no such write downs occurred in tax benefits related to these write downs may not be realizable and accordingly were not recorded for either year

these companies are focused in the medical diagnostic device  market research and telecommunications components industries 
income taxes the company recorded a tax provision of million in against a loss before taxes of million and cumulative effective of change in accounting principle 
the provision was adjusted by the potential non deductible capital losses associated with the write down of investments by xr ventures  llc 
exclusive of these write downs  the company would have had approximately a percent tax rate in  compared to the us statutory rate of percent 
this lower rate benefited from tax reductions received as a result of the company s foreign sales operations 
the effective tax rate for was zero percent  and approximately percent for cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective december   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires companies to discontinue amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with an indefinite life 
instead  companies are required to review goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life for impairment annually and as indicators of impairment occur 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  during  the company completed steps one and two of the transitional testing required by sfas no 
 as well as  the annual impairment testing requirement 
step two testing was completed with the assistance of an independent valuation firm during the fourth quarter of under sfas no  goodwill impairment exists if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the company evaluated goodwill using three reporting units  labsphere and optronik combined  coherix  and x rite mediterranee 
upon completion of the step two transitional testing for the labsphere and optronik combined reporting unit  it was determined that an impairment of goodwill had occurred 
therefore  a non cash charge of million  or cents per share  was recorded 
the decline in fair value of the labsphere and optronik reporting unit is primarily attributable to a decline in revenue and profitability for the unit 
this decline has led to a reduction in the three to five year projection of operating earnings for the unit 
the impairment is recorded under the caption cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations  retroactive to the first quarter of the fair value of the remaining reporting units exceeded their net book value 
therefore  no impairment charges were recorded for these units 
in calculating the impairment charge  the fair value of the reporting unit was determined by using a discounted cash flow analysis 
this methodology was selected over the market value approach  due to a lack of comparable competitor data availability  which is necessary to complete a market value study

the price the company will pay the founders estates for these shares will reflect a percent discount from the market price  although the discounted price may not be less than per share a total of million or more than per share a total of million 
the cost of the purchase agreements will be funded by million of proceeds from life insurance policies the company has purchased on the lives of certain of these individuals 
the company anticipates that stock purchases will not coincide with the receipt of insurance proceeds  therefore  borrowed funds may be required periodically to finance the company s purchase obligations 
insurance was purchased at the million level in order to provide adequate funding for both the maximum aggregate purchase price and anticipated borrowing costs

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in some instances there may be alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
management maintains a thorough process to review the application of accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to the financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable allowances are based on known customer exposures  historic credit experience  and the specific identification of potentially uncollectible accounts 
in addition to known or judgmental components  a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivables is followed 
actual collections can differ requiring adjustments to the reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
reserves are established for excess and obsolete inventory  based on material movement and a component of judgment for current events such as market conditions or technological advancement 
the amount of reserve required may be adjusted as these underlying factors change 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with benefits paid under employee health care programs 
the measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historic loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim 
these costs are accounted by developing estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred  including those claims incurred but not reported 
this method provides estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
long lived assets evaluations are periodically made of long lived assets and the company s venture capital investments for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that this risk may be present 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on several factors including but not limited to  market conditions  operational performance  technological advancements and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its fair value 
goodwill the company has million of goodwill recorded as of december   related to prior acquisitions 
new accounting standards adopted in  require that goodwill must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and as indicators of impairment occur  and the cessation of amortization 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each reporting unit to determine estimated fair values 
changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates 
however  once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded it cannot be reversed 
other matters in november of  the company s board of directors adopted a shareholder protection rights plan the plan  which became effective in the first quarter of the plan is designed to protect shareholders against unsolicited attempts to acquire control of the company in a manner that does not offer a fair price to all shareholders 
under the plan  one purchase right automatically trades with each share of the company s common stock 
each right entitles a shareholder to purchase of a share of junior participating preferred stock at a price of  if any person or group attempts certain hostile takeover tactics toward the company 
under certain hostile circumstances  each right may entitle the holder to purchase the company s common stock at one half its market value or to purchase the securities of any acquiring entity at one half their market value 
rights are subject to redemption by the company at 
per right and  unless earlier redeemed  will expire in the first quarter rights beneficially owned by holders of percent or more of the company s common stock  or their transferees and affiliates  automatically become void 
forward looking statements this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as other sections of the company s form k  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act  as amended  that are based on management s beliefs  assumptions  current expectations  estimates and projections about the industries it serves  the economy  and about the company itself 
words such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  likely  plans  projects  should  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements  such as those related to refining manufacturing processes  new products and new markets  are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing  extent  likelihood and degree of occurrence 
therefore  actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what may be expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
furthermore  x rite  incorporated undertakes no obligation to update  amend or clarify forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks including foreign currency exchange fluctuations  and market volatility in its investment and insurance portfolios 
in the normal course of business the company employs established procedures to evaluate its risks and take corrective actions when necessary to manage these exposures 
the company is not a party to any derivative instruments 
foreign exchange foreign currency exchange risks arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency and from foreign denominated transactions translated into us dollars 
the company s largest exposures are to the euro and british pound sterling 
in  approximately percent of the company s sales were invoiced in foreign currencies 
as these currencies fluctuate relative to the dollar  it may cause profitability to increase or decrease accordingly 
founders stock redemption program during  the company entered into agreements with its founding shareholders for the future purchase of million shares see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the repurchases will be funded by life insurance policies purchased on certain members of the founders group and their spouses 
these policies have cash value accumulation funds that provide investment income that is used to offset increasing mortality charges as the insureds age 
the cash value funds are invested in a combination of equity and bond funds as well as variable interest rate products issued by the underwriting carrier 
should the policies experience prolonged investment losses  or lower than anticipated interest crediting rates the policies may require additional cash deposits to keep them in force
