the notes to griffin s consolidated financial statements included in item contain a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of griffin s consolidated financial statements 
however  in the opinion of management  griffin does not have any individual accounting policy that is critical to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
this is due principally to the definitive nature of the accounting requirements for the landscape nursery and real estate businesses in which griffin is engaged 
also  in many cases  griffin must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following is a review of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by griffin revenue recognition griffin recognizes revenues for its landscape nursery business upon shipment of products to customers when title and risk of loss pass to the customers 
in griffin s real estate business  rental revenue is recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for leases  which requires that rental revenue be recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
real estate sales are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate which establishes standards for recognition of profit on real estate sales 
these standards require that profit on a transaction not be recognized until the amount is determinable  collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured and the earnings process is complete 
depreciation and amortization griffin depreciates its property and equipment and its real estate held for lease using straight line methods 
griffin amortizes goodwill related to its investment in centaur on a straight line method over forty years 
beginning in fiscal  griffin  as required  will adopt sfas no 
accordingly  griffin will no longer amortize the goodwill related to its investment in centaur  but that goodwill  and any other  will be tested at least annually for impairment see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
inventories griffin s inventories of its landscape nursery business are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the average cost method 
although nursery stock includes certain inventories that will not be sold within one year  it is industry practice to include such inventories in current assets 
impairment of long lived assets griffin evaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets in relation to their operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal griffin s consolidated net sales and other revenue were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase of million reflects an increase in net sales and other revenue of million at imperial and an increase in net sales and other revenue of million at griffin land 
net sales and other revenue at griffin land increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase of million in net sales and other revenue at griffin land reflects an increase of million of revenue from its leasing operations partially offset by a decrease of million on revenue from property sales 
the higher net sales and other revenue from griffin land s leasing operations was due to a an increase of million in rental revenue from two buildings that were built and partially leased in fiscal and leased for the entire year in fiscal  b a net increase of million in rental revenue from leasing space that was previously vacant  net of previously leased space that was vacated in the current year  and c an increase of million in rental revenue from the  square foot building in the new england tradeport that was completed in fiscal and leased for a portion of the year  which was partially offset by a decrease of million in other revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to million received in fiscal in connection with an agreement to terminate early a lease and million from construction management fees received in fiscal net sales and other revenue at imperial increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in net sales and other revenue at imperial of million reflects an increase in net sales of imperial s container grown plants of million in fiscal partially offset by the inclusion in fiscal of million of net sales from the sscs prior to their sale in january the increase in net sales of container grown plants reflects an increase in sales of larger sized plants  which have a higher per unit sales price  which more than offset a decline in unit sales volume in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in sales of larger sized plants reflects changes in imperial s product mix made over the past several years 
management believes that fiscal net sales were hampered by unfavorable weather conditions in imperial s markets during the spring  its peak selling season 
drought conditions in the mid atlantic area and excessive rain and cold in the midwest negatively affected sales in those areas 
griffin incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal as compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal griffin s operating loss in fiscal included an operating loss of million from imperial s sscs prior to their sale in january excluding the operating loss from the sscs in fiscal  griffin s overall operating results were substantially unchanged in fiscal as compared to fiscal operating profit at griffin land increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase of million in operating profit at griffin land reflects an increase of million in profit from property sales and a decrease of million in general and administrative expenses offset by an increase of million in depreciation expense 
profit  before depreciation  from griffin land s commercial properties was million in fiscal and fiscal however  fiscal results included a million benefit from a lease termination 
excluding the early lease termination payment received in fiscal  profit  before depreciation  from griffin land s commercial properties increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this reflects an increase in the amount of space leased in fiscal as compared to fiscal at november   griffin land had  square feet of office  flex and industrial space available for lease including  square feet in the office building shell that was recently completed and is now ready for tenant work and the  square feet of office space in the two buildings owned by the joint venture in which griffin held a interest as of november   of which  square feet was occupied 
at december  griffin had  square feet of office and industrial space available for lease with  square feet occupied at that time 
the increase in the amount of square feet available reflects the completion in fiscal of a  square foot facility in the new england tradeport that is fully leased and the completion of the shell of a  square foot office building that is not yet leased 
profit from property sales at griffin land increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal despite the decrease in property sales revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increased profitability reflects the substantially lower cost basis of the land sold in fiscal compared to the cost basis of the land sold in the prior year 
the increase in depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects a full year of depreciation expense in fiscal  as compared to a partial year of depreciation expense in fiscal  on tenant improvements on two buildings totaling  square feet placed in service during fiscal and the start of depreciation on the  square foot building that was completed in fiscal general and administrative expenses at griffin land decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the lower general and administrative expenses reflects a decrease of million in donations expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal and a decrease of million in employee recruitment expenses partially offset by higher insurance expenses 
imperial incurred an operating loss of million in both fiscal and fiscal excluding the loss from the ssc operations of million before they were sold in january 
the increase in gross profit generated from the higher net sales in fiscal was substantially offset by higher charges for unsaleable inventory  which were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the charges for unsaleable inventory in the current year were caused principally by failures in certain crops  poor results from the propagation of new plants in florida and failure to sell certain parts of the inventory which then became unsaleable 
as a result of these issues  management has made changes in certain horticultural practices and changes of certain personnel 
imperial s gross margin on sales  excluding the charges for unsaleable inventory  was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the higher gross margin on sales was principally due to changes in imperial s product mix 
imperial s operating expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  excluding the effect of the sscs in fiscal the lower operating expenses in fiscal reflect principally lower central overhead expenses at imperial due to headcount reductions as a result of the sale of the sscs in fiscal griffin s interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the higher interest reflects increased borrowings outstanding in fiscal as compared to fiscal borrowings in the current year were used to support the working capital needs at griffin s businesses  and investment in griffin land s real estate operation and capital expenditures at imperial 
griffin s financing requirements in fiscal were met using the proceeds from the sale of the sscs that remained after paying down the balance then outstanding of griffin s revolving credit agreement 
griffin s average amount of debt outstanding in fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal in addition  in fiscal griffin had capitalized interest of million as compared to capitalized interest of million in fiscal the lower amount of capitalized interest in fiscal reflects the lower amount of construction activity in fiscal as compared to fiscal griffin s effective rate of the income tax benefit in fiscal is as compared to an effective income tax rate of in fiscal the high effective benefit rate in fiscal reflects the tax benefit on its pretax loss and the reversal of a liability of million for income taxes as a result of a favorable outcome of tax examinations for earlier years 
the tax examinations were made on tax returns filed by culbro corporation culbro  griffin s parent company prior to the distribution the distribution of griffin common stock to culbro s shareholders in under a tax sharing agreement  the liability for income taxes was assumed by griffin from culbro at the time of the distribution 
the high effective tax rate in fiscal reflects a basis difference in the writedown of an investment 
griffin s equity income from centaur was million in fiscal as compared to an equity loss of million in fiscal the higher equity income in fiscal reflects the gain at centaur from the sale of its lawtel operation  of which griffin s allocable share was million 
there was no cash received by griffin from the sale because centaur used the proceeds to pay down its debt 
partially offsetting the gain on the sale of lawtel was a goodwill impairment charge at centaur  of which griffin s allocable share was million 
griffin s equity income from centaur in fiscal also benefited from the reversal by centaur of a valuation allowance on certain of its deferred tax assets  of which griffin s allocable share was million 
the equity loss in fiscal included a charge  of which griffin s allocable share was million  for expenses related to a proposed stock offering or sale that did not take place 
excluding the effect of these items  griffin s equity results from centaur were lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal  reflecting a weakened economy in the united kingdom which has resulted in lower revenue and lower operating results at centaur 
fiscal compared to fiscal griffin s net sales and other revenue were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal net sales and other revenue at imperial were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the lower net sales at imperial reflects the effect of the sale of the sscs in january net sales of the sscs were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal through the date the sscs were sold 
excluding the effect of the sale of the sscs  net sales at imperial increased by million 
the increase in net sales at imperial principally reflects additional product available for sale as a result of the recent expansion of imperial s connecticut and northern florida growing operations 
net sales and other revenue at griffin land increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase of million reflects an increase of million from higher rental revenue in fiscal as a result of leases on buildings completed and occupied in fiscal and new leases on space that was vacant in fiscal but occupied for most of fiscal additionally  revenue in fiscal included million from the agreement to terminate early a lease on one of its buildings 
the increase in rental revenue and the revenue from the early termination at griffin land substantially offset lower revenue from land sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from land sales decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal griffin incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal as compared to an operating profit of million in fiscal imperial incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal as compared to an operating profit of million in fiscal the lower operating results at imperial reflects the effect of the sale of the sscs in january due to the seasonality of the landscape nursery business  the sscs incurred an operating loss  before imperial s central overhead expenses  of million from the beginning of the fiscal year through their sale in january the sscs generated an operating profit  before imperial s central overhead expenses  of million in fiscal imperial s growing operations  including all of imperial s central overhead expenses  incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal as compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal the effect of higher net sales of container grown plants by imperial s growing operations was more than offset by higher cost of sales in fiscal  which included a charge for unsaleable inventory of million  due principally to horticultural issues  recorded in the third quarter 
imperial s operating expenses  excluding those expenses directly related to the sscs  were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal  excluding operating expenses directly related to the sscs 
the lower operating expenses in fiscal principally reflects lower central overhead expenses at imperial due principally to staff reductions as a result of the sale of the sscs and lower incentive compensation expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal operating profit at griffin land increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increased operating profit at griffin land principally reflects higher profit from commercial properties as a result of the increase in rental revenue in fiscal profit before depreciation from griffin land s commercial properties  excluding the benefit of the lease termination  was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase in profit  before depreciation  from commercial properties was partially offset by lower profit from property sales  higher operating expenses and higher depreciation expense 
profit from property sales declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the lower property sales revenue and the inclusion of properties with a lower cost basis in fiscal sales 
the higher depreciation expense reflected depreciation on new buildings placed into service in fiscal griffin s results in fiscal reflect a write down of million on its investment in linguaphone group plc linguaphone 
the write down reflects the decrease in the value of linguaphone based on a recent stock offering 
approximately of the carrying value of griffin s investment in linguaphone resulted from a distribution in of the common stock of linguaphone by its former parent company  centaur 
the remaining carrying value of griffin s investment in linguaphone  approximately million  reflects a recent cash investment by griffin 
griffin s interest expense declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal griffin s interest income increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the lower interest expense and higher interest income reflect repayment of the entire amount outstanding under griffin s credit agreement from the cash proceeds received from the sale of the sscs in january the remaining cash received from the sale of the sscs  after repayment of the amount then outstanding under griffin s revolving credit agreement was used to finance operations 
additionally  higher interest payments on mortgages  reflecting interest on a new mortgage entered into in march  was more than offset by a higher amount of interest capitalized on new construction projects during fiscal as compared to fiscal griffin s effective tax rate in fiscal is as compared to in fiscal the higher effective tax rate in reflects the effect of the tax basis of griffin s investment in linguaphone being lower than its book basis  therefore the write down did not generate the expected tax benefit had the tax basis of that asset been comparable to its book basis 
griffin had an equity loss from centaur in fiscal of million as compared to equity income of million in fiscal although centaur s operations were generally more profitable in fiscal  centaur incurred expenses  of which griffin s allocable share was million  related to a proposed stock offering or sale that did not take place 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million of net cash used in operating activities in fiscal the decrease of million of net cash used in operating activities was due to several factors  including receiving an income tax refund of million in fiscal as compared to income tax payments of million in fiscal the fiscal income tax payments principally relate to the gain on sale of the sscs in that year 
additionally  fiscal operating results at griffin land  before depreciation  increased by million  and although imperial s fiscal results from its container growing operations were substantially unchanged from fiscal  fiscal included an operating loss of million from imperial s sscs before they were sold 
these items were partially offset by the effect of higher interest expense and overall unfavorable working capital changes 
in fiscal  cash used in investing activities was million as compared to cash of million provided by investing activities in fiscal  which included net proceeds of million from the sale of imperial s sscs in additions to griffin land s real estate assets were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the higher amount of additions to real estate assets in fiscal reflects construction of a  square foot building in griffin center in windsor  connecticut  and a  square foot building in griffin center south in bloomfield  connecticut  in that year 
both of these buildings were completed in fiscal and are now leased 
in addition  the shell of a  square foot building  built on speculation was started in fiscal in fiscal  cash used for additions to griffin land s real estate assets included building the shell of a  square foot office building in griffin center and the completion of the shell and build out of the interior of its new  square foot building in the new england tradeport in windsor  connecticut 
the tenant work for that building  started as a result of entering into a lease for the entirety of that building  was completed in the third quarter 
the shell of the new  square foot office building was completed in the fourth quarter and is ready for tenant work  although none of this building has been leased yet 
fiscal investing activities also include a million payment for a deposit on griffin land s acquisition of a interest in a joint venture that owns two office buildings 
the acquisition was completed in december see below 
capital expenditures of million in fiscal and million in fiscal were principally for the expansion of imperial s farming operation in northern florida 
over the past three years  imperial has expanded and updated its facilities in connecticut and northern florida 
total costs of these projects is approximately million  with only million of work left to complete as of the end of fiscal the expansion is expected to be completed in fiscal in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was million as compared to cash of million used in financing activities in fiscal cash provided by financing activities in fiscal principally reflects borrowings made under griffin s million revolving credit agreement  as amended the credit agreement  with fleet national bank fleet which was completed on february  and a new mortgage entered into on september  the credit agreement has a three year term and is collateralized by certain of griffin land s real estate assets 
the initial borrowing under the credit agreement was used to repay the amount then outstanding under griffin s bridge loan  to repay a mortgage on one of griffin s commercial buildings and for certain expenses related to the credit agreement 
subsequent borrowings were used to finance griffin s seasonal working capital requirements  particularly those at imperial 
there was million outstanding on the credit agreement at november  on september   a subsidiary of griffin completed a million nonrecourse mortgage of two commercial buildings 
the mortgage loan has an interest rate of and a fifteen year term  with payments based on a twenty five year amortization period 
proceeds of the mortgage were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
one of the properties included in this mortgage was previously included in the collateral for the credit agreement 
as a result of removing that property from the collateral of the credit agreement  the commitment under the credit agreement was reduced to million 
griffin is currently negotiating with fleet to increase the amount available under the credit agreement to million 
the proposed increase in the commitment would be collateralized by certain of griffin s real estate assets 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  griffin completed the acquisition  for million  of a interest in a joint venture that owns two office buildings of approximately  square feet each in griffin center 
griffin previously held the other interest in these buildings 
this acquisition was temporarily financed under the credit agreement 
shortly after the acquisition  griffin completed a million nonrecourse mortgage 
the mortgage loan has an interest rate of and a ten year term with payments based on a twenty five year amortization period 
proceeds of the mortgage were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
in fiscal  griffin land is planning to continue to invest in its real estate assets  including plans to build  on speculation  the shell of an approximately  square foot facility in the new england tradeport  which is expected to require approximately million 
additional amounts will be required to complete the interior of this new building and the interior of the  square foot office building in griffin center that was completed at the end of fiscal the buildout of the interiors of these buildings will be started when leases are obtained 
improvements to be made in fiscal to the infrastructure at griffin center and the new england tradeport are expected to be approximately million 
griffin land will also continue to seek approval for its proposed residential developments 
early in fiscal  a court ruling upheld the denial  by simsbury s inland wetlands commission  of griffin s land s application for a wetlands activity permit in connection with its proposed residential development 
griffin land is appealing that decision 
on december   the superior court ruled that simsbury s planning and zoning commissions improperly denied griffin s residential applications and ordered the commissions to reverse their decisions and approve griffin land s proposed zone change and proposed site plan 
the town is requesting permission from the appellate court to appeal these decisions 
griffin land also has an agreement for the sale of the remaining development rights at its walden woods residential development in windsor  connecticut 
the completion of that sale is subject to the purchaser receiving approval from the town s commissions for their development plans and  based on such plans  proceeds from that sale are expected to be approximately million 
approvals from the town s commission on wetlands were obtained in fiscal  but a suit was filed challenging that approval 
completion of this transaction is not expected to take place in fiscal griffin land has also applied for approvals for a lot residential subdivision in suffield  connecticut 
sales from this project are not expected in fiscal griffin land intends to proceed with its other residential development plans on other of its lands that are also appropriate for that use 
griffin s capital spending at imperial in fiscal is expected to be less than million  substantially lower than it has been the past two years because the expansion of imperial s northern florida growing operation is substantially completed 
griffin s payments including principal and interest under contractual obligations as of november  are as follows total due within one year due from years due from years due in more than years in millions mortgages credit agreement a capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations b other a reflects the amount outstanding for the credit agreement as of november  due to the variable interest rate on this debt  interest for future periods is not included above 
b includes commitments made as of november  for the purchase of services and materials for the planned construction in fiscal of an approximately  square foot building 
subsequent to november   additional purchase commitments aggregating million for services and materials for construction were incurred 
management believes that in the near term  based on the current level of operations and anticipated growth  borrowings available under the credit agreement  as amended  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to finance griffin s working capital requirements  expected capital expenditures of the landscape nursery business and development of its real estate assets 
over the intermediate and long term  additional mortgage placements  construction financing or additional bank credit facilities are expected to be required to fund capital projects 
forward looking information the above information in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
although griffin believes that its plans  intentions and expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such plans  intentions or expectations will be achieved  particularly with respect to the expansion and improved return on assets of imperial s operations  construction and leasing of additional facilities in the real estate business  completion of the sale of the development rights of walden woods  approval of other proposed residential subdivisions and obtaining an increase in the commitment of the credit agreement 
the projected information disclosed herein is based on assumptions and estimates that  while considered reasonable by griffin as of the date hereof  are inherently subject to significant business  economic  competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the control of griffin 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
for fixed rate mortgage debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not earnings or cash flows 
griffin does not have an obligation to prepay any fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and therefore  interest rate risk and changes in the fair market value of fixed rate debt should not have a significant impact on earnings or cash flows until such debt is refinanced  if necessary 
griffin s mortgage interest rates and related principal payment requirements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
griffin had million of variable rate debt outstanding at november  griffin is exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on market values of griffin s cash equivalent short term investments 
these investments generally consist of overnight investments that are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk  except to the extent that changes in interest rates will ultimately affect the amount of interest income earned and cash flow from these investments 
griffin does not currently have any derivative financial instruments in place to manage interest costs  but that does not mean that griffin will not use them as a means to manage interest rate risk in the future 
griffin does not use foreign currency exchange forward contracts or commodity contracts and does not have foreign currency exposure in operations 
griffin does have equity investments in privately owned companies based in the united kingdom 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could affect the results of an equity investment in griffin s financial statements 
the companies have historically reinvested their earnings for future growth 
the ultimate liquidation of those investments and conversion of proceeds into united states currency is subject to future foreign currency exchange rates
