item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes  included elsewhere in this report  and the information contained in selected financial and operating data 
production the company s production of palladium and platinum is a result of the tons of ore mined  the mill head grade and metallurgical recovery 
the company measures its mine production by ounces contained in concentrate reduced by subsequent processing losses expected to be incurred when shipped to the company s smelter  which generally occurs within four days of the ore being mined 
shipment from the company s refinery to a third party refiner generally occurs within days of mining 
approximately days elapse between the time ore is extracted from the mines and the time ounces of recovered precious metal contained in that ore are made available by a third party refiner to the company for sale 
because of the length of the processing cycle and the different cutoff points for identifying production and sales  production may not always correspond to sales in a particular accounting period 
however  any production not shipped from the metal refinery at the end of an accounting period is generally shipped during the first two weeks of the subsequent period and the material is included in the company s in process inventory 
the company records revenue when title passes to its customers 
the ore grade of the company s ore reserves is an average of the composite of all samples 
as is common in an underground mine  the grade mined and the recovery rate achieved will vary depending on the area being mined 
in particular  mill head grade can be expected to vary by up to depending on the area of the mine where extraction is occurring 
during  and  the average mill head grade of total tons processed from the stillwater mine was   and ounce of pgms per ton of ore  respectively 
during  the average mill head grade of total tons processed from the east boulder mine was ounce per ton of 
table of contents ore 
during  comparable mill head grade for the east boulder mine was ounce per ton  however  the proceeds of all production of pgm s was credited against capitalized mine development as the mine was in the pre production phase 
during  the company s operations produced a total of  ounces  which included  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum 
pgm production increased from  but was below the company s september  revised forecast pgm production for the company s production was effected by several issues during in an effort to reduce costs  in june  the company amended certain provisions of the incentive bonus contract with its labor unions regarding the stillwater mine to correct an unintended prior increase in the amount of incentive bonus paid to affected employees in january as a result  the company experienced industrial relations problems in the third quarter  including reduced production by affected employees from historical levels 
in the company increased the level of production at the stillwater mine in an area of the mine known as the upper west 
the ore grade from the upper west was lower than the grade for the other ore mined by the company  thus reducing the company s ability to produce ore in line with its prior forecasts 
in addition  during the fourth quarter production was affected by several issues arising from increased msha enforcement activity  which primarily dealt with machinery noise levels  new interpretations of standards and renewed emphasis on explosives use and handling driven by the us department of homeland security 
capitalized mine development the stillwater mine currently uses its footwall laterals  totaling approximately  feet  and primary ramps  totaling approximately  feet  and the east boulder mine currently uses its two levels of footwall lateral drives totaling approximately  feet  and two primary ramps  totaling approximately  feet  to provide men and equipment access  supply haulage and drainage  intake and exhaust ventilation systems  muck haulage  backfill plant access  powder storage and or emergency egress 
to date  no footwall lateral has exhausted its requirement to support mining activities 
the footwall lateral and primary ramp systems will continue to provide support of production and ongoing development activities 
currently  all underground infrastructure  including footwall laterals  are located within the company s proven and probable reserve area and are intended to be used for the life of the mine 
the company s capitalized mine development  including footwall laterals and ramps  consist of permanent infrastructure that is integral and necessary not only for current operations  but also for all future planned operations 
accordingly  these costs which only includes the costs incurred to date are being amortized over the proven and probable ore reserves to be benefited utilizing the unit of production method 
significant additional development costs will be required to access the company s probable ore reserves 
these estimated future costs are not reflected in the amortization rate  however  the company includes all of its proven and probable ore reserves in its determination of its amortization rate 
revenue the company s revenue and earnings are significantly influenced by worldwide prices of palladium and platinum  which can be volatile and over which the company has no control 
sales to significant customers represented approximately  and of total revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
sales to these customers were pursuant to long term sales contracts which provide floor and ceiling price structures 
for a description of these contracts see business and properties current operations sales and hedging activities 
although the company sells its metals to a small number of customers and brokers  the company could  if the need were to arise  readily sell its metal on pgm markets throughout the world 
from time to time  the company uses basic hedging techniques involving fixed forwards  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forwards  attempts to lock in prices for its production  benefit from price increases and protect against price decreases for a portion of its production within the floor and ceiling prices which exist with its customers 
terminal markets exist for both metals and prices are established as metal is traded each day 
such hedging contracts will also preclude the company from obtaining the benefit of increased market prices for its contracted metals 
as a result  the company s revenues were favorably impacted in and by million and million  respectively  and negatively impacted in by million 
see business and properties sales and hedging activities 
the company may continue to use forward contract and put and call option strategies to manage the potential negative effects of metal price volatility on its financial results 
as of december   the company had no metal committed under either forward delivery contracts or put and call option strategies for delivery in future years 
the company s put and call options are financially settled at maturity 
the company has credit agreements with its major trading partners that provide for margin deposits in the event that forward prices for metals exceed the company s hedge contract prices by a predetermined margin limit 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  pgm production 
during  the company produced approximately  ounces of palladium and platinum  which included  ounces of palladium and approximately  ounces of platinum  respectively  compared with approximately  ounces of palladium and approximately  ounces of platinum during  which excludes the development ounces recovered from the east boulder mine in of approximately  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum 
the increase was primarily due to the east boulder mine  which commenced commercial production in and produced  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum in this was partially offset by a decrease in production at the stillwater mine primarily due to the lower mill head grade as a result of an increased emphasis in mining the upper west area  which produced  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum in the company s pgm production increased  ounces from  or  but was  ounces  or below the company s september  revised forecast pgm production for at the stillwater mine  the production shortfall was a result of an industrial relations problem experienced during the third quarter of  interruptions arising from increased mine safety and health administration enforcement activity during the fourth quarter of and a lower ore grade than plan as a result of mining in the upper west area 
at the east boulder mine  production was affected by ore grade  which was below the company s target 
revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december   compared with million in  a decrease  and were the result of a decrease in combined realized pgm prices of  offset by a increase in the quantity of metal sold 
palladium sales increased to approximately  ounces in from approximately  ounces in platinum sales increased to approximately  ounces in from approximately  ounces in as a result  the total quantity of metal sold increased to approximately  ounces in from approximately  ounces in the company has long term contracts with its customers for the majority of the production of the mines 
these contracts have floor and ceiling prices which mitigate somewhat the price volatility evident in pgm markets 
the company s combined average realized price per ounce of palladium and platinum sold in decreased to per ounce  compared to per ounce in the combined average market price  as determined in the pgm markets  decreased to per ounce in  compared with per ounce in the company s average realized price per ounce of palladium was per ounce in  a decrease  compared to per ounce for  while the average market price decreased to per ounce in from per ounce in the company s average realized price per ounce of platinum sold was per ounce in  compared with per ounce in the platinum average market price was per ounce in compared to per ounce in production costs 
total consolidated cash costs per ounce produced in the year ended december  increased  or  to per ounce from per ounce in the year ended december  the increase in total consolidated cash costs per ounce is attributed to a per ounce increase in operating costs primarily related to placing the east boulder mine into commercial production in and lower production ounces at the stillwater mine due to lower grade 
total consolidated production costs per ounce in the year ended december  increased  or  to per ounce from per ounce in the year ended december  the increase is due to the increase in operating costs per ounce and an increase in depreciation and amortization costs of per ounce  due to lower production ounces at the stillwater mine and the impact of placing the east boulder mine assets into commercial production during  combined with changes in ore reserve estimates used in calculating depreciation 
expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  during the year ended december   primarily as a result of  i lower costs of million related to reduced project management and recruiting activities associated with the company s previous expansion plan and ii during the year ended december   the company incurred million of severance costs attributable to a management realignment and consulting fees of million 
during the year ended december  the company incurred million related to a settlement of a legal dispute with a terminated refining contract 

table of contents during the year ended december   the company revised its estimate of accrued restructuring costs as a result of negotiations of certain termination clauses of construction contracts cancelled 
the company made adjustments to reduce the accrual by million during also  during  the company made an addition to its restructuring accrual of million to reflect the decision to eliminate six management positions  which resulted in a net adjustment to increase pre tax income by million 
interest expense increased million as a result of placing the east boulder mine into production in  which resulted in interest being expensed rather than capitalized 
income taxes 
the company has provided for income taxes of million  or of pretax income  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of pretax income  for the year ended december  net income 
the company s net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share in other comprehensive loss 
for the year ended december   other comprehensive loss of million  net of tax  includes a decline in the market value of the interest rate swaps of million and a decline in the market value of commodity instruments of million 
other comprehensive loss also includes reclassification adjustments to earnings of million associated with deferred gains on commodity instruments and million associated with losses on interest rate swaps 
for  the company recorded other comprehensive income of million  net of tax  due to the increase in the market value of commodity derivative instruments of million  off set by reclassification adjustments to earnings of million associated with the gains on commodity instruments 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  pgm production 
during  the stillwater mine produced approximately  ounces of palladium and approximately  ounces of platinum  respectively  compared with approximately  ounces of palladium and approximately  ounces of platinum during the increase was due to a increase in tons milled at the stillwater mine in compared to  offset by a decrease in the average grade of material milled 
revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december   compared with million in  an increase of and were the result of an increase in higher combined average realized pgm prices of and a increase in the quantity of metal sold 
palladium sales increased to approximately  ounces in from approximately  ounces in platinum sales increased to approximately  ounces in from approximately  ounces in as a result  the total quantity of metal sold increased to approximately  ounces in from approximately  ounces in the company s combined average realized price per ounce of palladium and platinum sold in increased to per ounce  compared to per ounce in the combined average market price  as determined in the pgm markets  decreased to per ounce in  compared with per ounce in the company s average realized price per ounce of palladium was per ounce in  compared to per ounce for  while the average market price decreased to per ounce in from per ounce in the company s average realized price per ounce of platinum sold was per ounce in  compared with per ounce in the platinum average market price was per ounce in compared to per ounce in production costs 
total cash costs per ounce produced in the year ended december  were per ounce and were comparable to the cash costs per ounce in the year ended december  the total cash costs per ounce are comparable as a result of increased production and lower royalties and taxes associated with lower average market prices  offset by increased mine overhead costs and decreased byproduct credits 
total production costs per ounce increased  or to per ounce from per ounce due to an increase in non cash costs of per ounce related to increased production and a higher depreciable capital base 
expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million primarily as a result of million of increased administrative support required to transition the company from a single site producer to a double location producer  million related to consulting services and million associated with management realignment 
the company incurred a million expense related to a settlement of a legal dispute with a terminated refining contract 
the company also accrued million in restructuring costs associated with the revised plan implemented during the year 

table of contents income taxes 
the company provided for income taxes of million  or of pretax income  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of pretax income  for the year ended december  the reduction in the effective tax rate is the result of a change in the treatment of mine development costs that will allow the company to increase depletion expense for tax purposes 
net income 
the company s net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share in other comprehensive income 
for the year ended december   other comprehensive income of million  net of tax  includes an increase in the market value of commodity derivative instruments of million  offset by reclassification adjustments to earnings of million associated with the gains on commodity instruments 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  compared to year ended december  at december   the company s available cash was million and it had million outstanding under its term loan facility and million outstanding as letters of credit under the revolving credit facility 
during  the company will be required to make total payments of approximately million in principal reductions to its debt outstanding at december  which includes million in schedule principal payments on the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
the company will also be required to pay approximately million in total interest payments 
at december   cash and cash equivalents had increased by million to million  compared with a decrease of million to million at december  for the year ended december   net cash provided by operations was million compared to million for the decrease of million was primarily a result of decreased net income of million  a decrease in non cash expenses of million  payments on the restructuring accrual of million and a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of million 
a net total of million of cash was used in investing activities in  compared to a net total of million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily due to a reduction of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures primarily relating to mine activities for were million a decrease of million  compared to million in the decrease is due to a reduction of capital expenditures in accordance with the company s optimization plan put in place after the company suspended its expansion program in late  in response to rapidly eroding commodity prices 
during  the company expects to invest approximately million in capital items 
for the year ended december   cash flow from financing activities was million compared to million for the year ended december  the cash provided by financing activities in were primarily attributed to net proceeds of million from a stock offering  offset by payments of million on the company s credit facility 
for the same period of  cash flow from financing activities of million was primarily attributed to net borrowings of million under the company s credit facility  offset by a repayment of million on the company s prior credit facility and a net reduction in metals repurchase agreements of million 
credit agreement in february  the company entered into a million credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions which replaced a previous million bank facility 
the facility has been amended or waivers have been obtained seven times with the most recent amendment effective march  the credit facility provides for a million five year term loan facility term a  a million seven year term loan facility term b and a million revolving credit facility reduced from million at the company s request as of march  
amortization of the term loan facilities commenced on march  the final maturity of the term a facility and revolving credit facility is december  the term b facility s final maturity date is december  as of december   the company has million and million outstanding under the term a and term b facilities  respectively  bearing interest at and  respectively 
during  the company entered into a letter of credit in the amount of million  which reduces amounts available under the revolving credit facility at december   bearing interest at 

table of contents the revolving credit facility requires an annual commitment fee of on the remaining unadvanced amount 
of the million revolving credit facility  million remains available to the company 
the required principal payments for the term a loan total million in and and million in the required principal payments for the term b loan total million in  and  million in and million in any outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility will be due in its entirety on december  the loans are required to be prepaid from excess cash flow  proceeds from asset sales and the issuance of debt or equity securities  subject to specified exceptions 
proceeds of the term loan facility were used to finance a portion of the company s expansion plan 
proceeds of the revolving credit facility are being used for general corporate and working capital needs 
for further information on the credit facility see business and properties current operations credit agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that it would likely not be in compliance with a minimum production covenant for in its credit agreement 
as a result  the company obtained a waiver from its lenders dated december   which reduced the trailing four quarters production covenant requirement from  ounces to  ounces of palladium and platinum 
as a result of the waiver  the company was in compliance with all production and financial covenants of the credit agreement as of december  in the first quarter of  the company began implementing a long range operating plan  which focuses on reducing its operating and capital costs 
therefore  the company lowered its pgm production target to  ounces 
as a result  it determined that it would not likely be in compliance with its covenants under the credit agreement at march  despite historically achieving positive net income  the company requires substantial funds for its necessary capital expenditures and to make the interest and principal payments under its credit facility 
at december   the company s available cash was million 
at the current palladium prices and without access to additional capital or borrowings under the revolving credit facility  management did not believe that the company s cash would be sufficient to maintain its projected liquidity requirements through consequently  the company began working with its lead banks to obtain amendments or waivers of various covenants under the credit agreement and to obtain access to additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
on march   the company obtained an amendment to the credit agreement that  among other things  modifies certain production and financial covenants for the remaining term of the agreement and allows for the norilsk nickel transaction 
the amendment also provides the company with access to the million of availability under the revolving credit facility 
for further information on the amendment to the credit agreement  see business and properties current operations credit agreement 
management believes with the amendments and access to undrawn million under the revolving credit facility  together with the cash expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to meet the company s liquidity needs through other working capital at december  was million  compared to million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to at december  on january   the company completed a million private placement of its common stock involving approximately million shares or approximately of the outstanding shares after such issuance 
the price per share represents an approximate discount from the closing price of on january  proceeds from the offering were approximately million  net of offering costs of million 
the proceeds were used to pay down the million revolving credit facility and the remaining used for general corporate purposes 
the company anticipates that a substantial rise in the cost of posting surety bonds or collateral  due to changing surety bond markets  may also adversely affect its liquidity in the future 
norilsk nickel transaction on november   the company and mining and metal company norilsk nickel norilsk nickel  a russian mining company  signed a definitive agreement whereby norimet  a wholly owned subsidiary of norilsk nickel  will acquire a majority 
table of contents ownership in stillwater through the issuance of million newly issued shares of stillwater common stock in exchange for million cash and approximately  ounces of palladium  valued at million  or per ounce  based on the november   london pm fix and valued at million  or per ounce  based on the march  london pm fix 
additionally  after the closing of the transaction and subject to certain conditions  norilsk nickel would commence a tender offer to acquire additionally up to million stillwater shares  of the currently outstanding shares  from the public at a cash price of per share 
if completed  the tender offer could increase norilsk nickel s ownership in stillwater to approximately of the outstanding shares

market risk the company may from time to time utilize derivative instruments to manage financial risk 
the company has entered into long term sales contracts with general motors corporation  ford motor company  and mitsubishi corporation 
the contracts apply to a significant portion of the company s production over the eight year period through december and to provide floor and ceiling price structure 
see business and properties current operations sales and hedging activities 
environmental obligations the company s environmental expenses were million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the company had capital expenditures for environmental facilities during  and of million  million and million  respectively 
the company s ongoing operating expenditures for environmental compliance are expected to exceed approximately million per year and are expensed as incurred 
the company is required to post reclamation surety bonds with the state of montana which are jointly held by the montana department of environmental quality and the united states forest service 
current bonding liabilities total approximately million 
the current bond amount is an estimate of reclamation and closure costs as projected years into the future 
as such  the regulatory agencies will review the bonding requirements and reclamation estimates on a year rotation or anytime a major amendment to the operating permits is approved 
the company expects that the stillwater bond will be reviewed and adjusted by the agencies during and will  in all likelihood  be increased 
the company is accruing for reclamation costs over the life of the stillwater mine based on current production levels and estimated proven and probable ore reserves 
as of december   the accrued liability was million compared to million at december  the company periodically reviews the adequacy of its reclamation and mine closure obligations in light of current laws and regulations and will adjust its estimate as necessary

table of contents critical accounting policies mine development expenditures capitalization and amortization mine development expenditures incurred to date to increase existing production  develop new orebodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production are capitalized and amortized using a units of production method over the proven and probable reserves 
mine development expenditures consist of a vertical shaft  multiple surface adits and underground infrastructure development including footwall laterals  ramps  rail and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
these facilities are required not only for current operations  but also for all future planned operations 
accordingly  these costs are amortized over the company s estimated proven and probable ore reserves 
the company s proven reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
additional capital expenditures will be required to access the company s estimated probable ore reserves 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depreciation and amortization 
the company calculates amortization of capitalized mine development by the application of an amortization rate to current production 
the amortization rate is based upon un amortized expenditures and proven and probable ore reserves  as defined by the securities and exchange commission industry guidelines  as of the beginning of the period 
capital expenditures are added to un amortized capitalized cost as the assets are placed into service 
changes in proven and probable ore reserves are accounted for  in calculating the amortization rate  as a prospective change in estimate 
proven and probable ore reserves and the future benefit of capitalized mine development expenditures are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimates of proven and probable reserves  could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuation of the related assets 
mine development expenditures  ore reserves and mine development amortization expense are separately determined for each of the company s mines 
based on current mining rates  and existing ore reserves  the stillwater mine and the east boulder mine have estimated productive lives of approximately and years respectively  at december  as the company s mines approach their closing stages  the remaining un amortized mine development expenditures in addition to future development expenditures necessary to access all remaining proven and probable reserves will be amortized over a declining amount of reserves and  accordingly  the amortization rate per unit of production is expected to increase 
the anticipated increase in the amortization rate per unit of production is reflective of the increasing accumulated cost of accessing ore in new areas of the mine 
the company expects that future capitalized development expenditures necessary to access these remaining proven and probable ore reserves will decline as the properties reach the end of the expected mine lives 
the expected decrease in the level of capitalized mine development expenditures during the closing stages may moderate increases in the amortization rate per unit of production 
expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and access specific reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time and  accordingly  are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
mining operations are inherently capital intensive  generally requiring substantial capital investment for the initial and concurrent development and preparation of the mine 
many of these expenditures are necessarily incurred well in advance of actual extraction of ore 
other development costs occur contemporaneously with mining activities 
underground mining operations such as those conducted by the company require driving tunnels and sinking shafts that provide access to the underground orebody and construction and development of infrastructure  including electrical and ventilation systems  rail and other forms of transportation  shop facilities  material handling areas and hoisting systems 
ore mining and removal operations require significant underground facilities used to conduct mining operations and to transport the ore out of the mine to processing facilities located above ground at the mine mouth 
contemporaneously  as ore is mined  additional ongoing development is undertaken to provide access to the extension of the ore body  allowing additional ore to be produced 
in addition to the development costs that have been previously incurred  these ongoing development expenditures are necessary to access all ore that is expected to be mined 
the company s proven ore reserves are based on interpolation between closely spaced diamond drill holes which intersect the j m reef and reflect the information required for detailed mine planning 
probable ore reserves are based on interpolation between sample 
table of contents points where sample spacing is greater than that for proven reserves or extrapolation from sample points 
a significant portion of the probable ore reserves are based on extrapolation 
the probable ore reserve areas are expected to be converted to proven ore reserves as the mine is developed 
the factors used for determining the amount of probable ore reserves are estimated based on statistical analysis of the diamond drilling adjacent to these areas 
the actual results for specific reserve blocks may be different than that estimated in the determination of probable ore reserves 
any changes in these assumptions could have a material effect on the estimates of probable ore reserves to be recovered over the life of the mine resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuation of the related assets 
asset impairment the company follows statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is determined using estimated discounted future cash flow analysis 
future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces  platinum and palladium prices considering current and historical prices  price trends and related factors  production levels  capital and reclamation expenditures  all based on detailed life of mine plans derived from engineering reports 
in estimating future cash flows  assets are grouped together at each individual mine property which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
assumptions underlying future cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties 
any differences between significant assumptions and market conditions such as declining pgm prices  lower than expected recoverable ounces  and or the company s performance could have a material effect on the company s ability to recover the carrying amounts of its long lived assets resulting in potential impairment charges 
as of december   the company does not believe that any impairments of its long lived assets have occurred 
for the calendar years ended december   and  the company realized combined pgm prices of  and per ounce  respectively 
based upon the company s mine plans  an asset impairment could potentially be required at a combined realized pgm price below a three year average of approximately per ounce 
however  should estimated projected prices fall below that level  the company would expect to modify its mine plans to optimize its operations  and thereby the recovery of its capitalized costs 
during the first two months of  based upon market prices and giving effect to the company s marketing contracts  it realized a combined pgm price of per ounce sold 
income taxes income taxes are determined using the asset and liability approach in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax rates 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the company expects the deferred tax assets at december  to be realized as a result of projected income from future operations and reversal of existing taxable temporary differences 
any differences between the assumptions used in management s analysis and market conditions  such as declining pgm prices and lower recoverable ounces  that would effect the company s future taxable income could have a material effect on the ability of the company to fully realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets 
there was no valuation allowance recorded at december  because it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized 
reclamation liabilities post closure reclamation and site restoration costs are estimated based on environmental regulatory requirements and are accrued ratably over the life of the mine using a units of production method 
current bonding liabilities total approximately million 
the current bond amount is an estimate of reclamation and closure costs as projected five years into the future 
as such  the regulatory agencies will review the bonding requirements and reclamation estimates on a year rotation or anytime a major 
table of contents amendment to the operating permits is approved 
the company expects that the stillwater bond will be reviewed and adjusted by the agencies during and will  in all likelihood  be increased 
any differences between the required bonded amounts and actual post closure reclamation and site restoration costs could have a material effect on the company s estimated liability resulting in an increase in the recorded amount 
the accrued reclamation liability was approximately million at december  hedging program effective january   the company adopted the fasb sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment to sfas no 
sfas nos 
and require that derivatives be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and  if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value must be recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined to be effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or b reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the company primarily uses derivatives to hedge metal prices and manage interest rate risk 
as of december  there are no outstanding derivatives associated with commodity instruments 
as of december   the outstanding interest rate swaps are valued at an unrealized loss of million  net of tax  and are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in metal prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces and sells palladium  platinum and associated byproduct metals directly to its customers and also through third parties 
as a result  financial risks are materially affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
in order to manage commodity price risk and to reduce the impact of negative fluctuation in prices  the company enters into long term contracts and uses various derivative financial instruments 
because the company hedges only with instruments that have a high correlation with the value of the hedged transactions  changes in derivatives fair value are expected to be offset by changes in the value of the hedged transaction 
the company has entered into long term sales contracts with general motors corporation  ford motor company and mitsubishi corporation 
the contracts apply to the portions of the company s production over the period through december and provide for a floor and ceiling price structure 
see business and properties sales and hedging activities 
as of december   the company had no metal committed for future delivery under either forward delivery contracts or under put and call option strategies 
the company utilizes financially settled forwards and cashless put and call option collars 
under financially settled forwards  at each settlement date  the company receives the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is below the forward price and the company pays the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is above the forward price 
the company s financially settled forwards are settled at maturity 
under cashless put and call option collars  at each settlement  the company receives the difference between the put price and the market price if the market price is below the put price and the company pays the difference between the call price and the market price of the market price is above the call price 
see note to the consolidated financial statements attached hereto for additional information about long term sales contracts
