overview we operate in one segment  the development and licensing of software products that are used in the design and verification of semiconductors 
we market and sell our products throughout north america  principally the united states  as well as in europe  japan and other parts of asia 
our revenue from sales outside north america represented approximately  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
our products include our synplify product  an fpga logic synthesis product  our hdl analyst product  a complementary product to synplify which provides graphical representation and design analysis  our certify product  a product for verification of asics by synthesizing multi fpga prototypes  
table of contents our amplify physical optimizer product  a physical synthesis product for fpgas  our synplify pro product  an advanced fpga logic synthesis product  our synplify asic product  a timing driven asic synthesis product optimized to improve productivity  our fortify powerplanner product  an early stage power grid design solution  our fortify realpower product  a power grid design verification tool for deep submicron integrated circuits  our fortify powertime product  which measures the performance degradation associated with the ir drop  and our identify product  a product that assists in debugging hardware directly in the rtl source code 
today  we primarily sell perpetual licenses to use our software products and related maintenance services  therefore our revenue consists of license and maintenance revenue 
maintenance services include unspecified product updates and electronic  internet based technical support and telephone support 
historically  we have generated the majority of our total revenue from licenses 
however  as a result of our growing installed customer base and the decreased level of license revenue recognized  maintenance revenue has increased as a percent of total revenue 
we also sell time based licenses to use our software products  which have represented a growing proportion of total revenue 
time based licenses include maintenance services for the duration of their respective terms 
in july  we completed the acquisition of certain products and technology from iota  which we accounted for as a business acquisition per the guidelines of emerging issues task force  determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business eitf 
the total purchase price was approximately million  comprised of million in cash   shares of our common stock valued at approximately million and approximately  of acquisition related costs 
we acquired signal integrity and power analysis technology  power planning and analysis products  as well as additional deep submicron intellectual property 
we sell the acquired powerplanner  realpower and powertime products as part of a new fortify family of power solutions 
we plan to incorporate the acquired power analysis technology into our development of next generation asic synthesis and design implementation products 
in november  we completed a product and technology acquisition from bridgessilicon  inc  which we accounted for as an asset acquisition per the guidelines of eitf the total purchase price of approximately million  comprised of million in cash and approximately  of acquisition related costs 
we acquired bridgessilicon s fpga rtl debug product  core technology and other intellectual property 
we have begun selling the fpga rtl debug product as our new identify product and we intend to apply the underlying technology to the development of next generation rtl debug products 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition for each sale of a perpetual license  the first year of maintenance is generally sold with the license 
we defer the recognition of license and maintenance revenue until a purchase order is received from the customer  
table of contents delivery of the product and license key has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable and we have no remaining obligations 
once all of the above conditions have been met  license revenue is recognized based upon the residual method after all elements other than maintenance have been delivered in accordance with aicpa statement of position  modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
once the first four of the above conditions have been met  maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance period since customers under maintenance agreements receive unspecified product updates and electronic  internet based technical support and telephone support throughout their maintenance period  which is typically one year 
a substantial majority of our customers also purchase maintenance renewals annually  which  depending on the product  we offer at either or of the list price of the specific perpetual product license  and which establishes vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of maintenance 
we also offer three year term licenses for certain products under which the customer can purchase the first year of maintenance with the license and can renew maintenance in each of the following two years 
revenue from term licenses is recognized in the same manner as revenue from perpetual licenses as the vsoe of fair value of maintenance is established by the maintenance renewal pricing 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable for sales with payment terms outside of our normal terms based on evaluating our history of collections from these customers and their current financial standing 
in no case will we deem a fee to be fixed or determinable where the fee is not due until after the expiration of the license or more than months after delivery 
we make judgments as to whether or not collection of the fee is probable based on the analysis provided by our credit review procedures 
revenue on arrangements to end user customers that have met all the revenue recognition criteria except probability of collection is recognized as collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally as payments are received 
revenue on sales to distributors and resellers is generally considered to have met the probability of collection criteria when the distributor or reseller has resold the product to an end user and either we have received payment for the product or we assess that we have a substantial and sustained history of collections from them 
we also sell time based licenses to use our software products for specified periods of time 
time based licenses include maintenance services for the duration of their respective terms 
revenue from time based licenses is allocated between license and maintenance revenue in similar proportion to perpetual license transactions  and recognized ratably over the period of the license as we do not have vsoe of the fair value of maintenance since it is not priced or offered separately 
in addition  we have provided a version of one of our products to certain fpga manufacturers for distribution to their customers 
as part of these agreements we have certain maintenance and support obligations to the fpga manufacturers 
revenue on these arrangements is also allocated to license and maintenance revenue and recognized ratably over the period of each arrangement  as we do not have vsoe of the fair value of maintenance since it is not priced or offered separately 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment using a fair value approach 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter as well as whenever indicators of impairment exist 
long lived assets  including intangible assets  are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
recoverability of a long lived asset other than goodwill is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is expected to generate 
an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount 
table of contents by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the assets 
significant management judgment is required in forecasting future operating results and cash flows and  should different conditions prevail or judgments be made  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
in addition  determining the useful life for an intangible asset is a matter of judgment and has an impact on the amount of amortization expense recorded in any given period 
different assumptions about the useful life of an intangible asset would result in more or less amortization expense being recorded in a given period 
our intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of five years 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas and such evaluations require judgment 
our evaluation for the year ending december  was based on the cumulative pre tax losses we have sustained in the three years ended december  results of operations the following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percent of total revenue 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

table of contents years ended december  and total revenue our total revenue decreased by to million for from million for this decrease was primarily attributable to lower license revenue reflecting the worldwide economic downturn particularly in the united states  partially offset by the increase in maintenance revenue 
license revenue 
license revenue decreased by to million for from million for this decrease was primarily due to lower license sales reflecting the worldwide economic downturn  particularly in the united states  as well as an increase in the percentage of our business from time based licenses  which reduces near term license revenue as the revenue is recognized over the license period 
maintenance revenue 
our maintenance revenue increased by to million for from million for  primarily as a result of our growing installed customer base  offset somewhat by lower license sales in compared to as well as a lower overall rate of maintenance renewal 
given the lower maintenance renewal rate we have experienced  total maintenance revenue may not increase in from  or may decline in or future periods 
cost of revenue cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue includes product packaging  software documentation and other costs associated with shipping  as well as royalties due from us to third parties 
our cost of license revenue remained relatively consistent at  for and  for as a percent of license revenue  the cost of license revenue remained at in and we expect that both the cost of license revenue in dollars and the cost of license revenue as a percent of license revenue will not vary significantly in from cost of maintenance revenue 
cost of maintenance revenue consists primarily of personnel and other expenses related to providing maintenance support to our customers 
cost of maintenance revenue remained relatively consistent at million in and as a percent of maintenance revenue  the cost of maintenance revenue decreased to for from for  primarily due to maintaining similar levels of costs while increasing maintenance revenue 
we expect that both the cost of maintenance revenue in dollars and the cost of maintenance revenue as a percent of maintenance revenue will increase during as we remove certain cost control measures that were put in place in  primarily employee salary reductions 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets of  during reflects the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of our purchases of products and technology from iota and bridgessilicon over a five year useful life 
we had no amortization of intangible assets in operating expenses research and development 
our research and development expenses decreased to million for from million for this decrease primarily resulted from cost control measures during including workforce reductions  lower salaries  lower consulting fees and lower recruiting costs  partially offset by personnel and consulting costs associated with the iota and bridgessilicon product and technology acquisitions 
we expect that research and development expenses in will be higher than as we remove certain cost control measures that were implemented in  primarily employee salary reductions 
as a percent of total revenue  research and development expenses increased to for from for due to the decrease in revenue 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for from million for this decrease was primarily due to lower commissions expense  as well as cost control

as a percent of total revenue  sales and marketing expenses remained at for and general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses decreased to million for from million for as a percent of total revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to for from for these decreases were primarily the result of lower bad debt expense  as well as cost control measures including workforce reductions  lower salaries  lower consulting fees and lower recruiting costs 
we expect that general and administrative expenses in will be higher than as we remove certain cost control measures that were implemented in  primarily employee salary reductions  and as we incur higher costs associated with corporate governance compliance 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense was  for and million for stock based compensation expense for related to the following cost of maintenance revenue of  research and development expenses of  sales and marketing expenses of  and general and administrative expenses of  stock based compensation expense for related to the following cost of maintenance revenue of  research and development expenses of  sales and marketing expenses of  and general and administrative expenses of  the remaining deferred stock based compensation at december  is expected to be amortized as follows  in   in   in and  in the amount of stock based compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could decrease if options for which accrued but unvested compensation has been recorded are forfeited 
acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development expense of million during was incurred in connection with the write off of research and development assets acquired in connection with our product and technology acquisitions during we had no acquired in process research and development expense in other income  net other income  net decreased to  for from million for  primarily as a result of the decrease in interest rates available on investments  as well as lower cash and investment balances 
income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of  for which primarily represented foreign income taxes 
our provision for income taxes in differed from the tax benefit that would be derived from applying the federal statutory rate to the loss before taxes primarily due to foreign income taxes and an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
we recorded an income tax provision of  in our provision for income taxes in differed from the tax provision that would be derived from applying the federal statutory rate to the income before taxes primarily due to federal and state minimum taxes  foreign income taxes and non deductible amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million 
management has evaluated the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas based on the cumulative pre tax losses we have sustained in the three years ended december   a valuation allowance  in an amount equal to our net deferred tax assets of december   was recorded 
the valuation allowance increased by approximately million and million in and  respectively and decreased by million in as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  
table of contents respectively 
the federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in  if not utilized 
the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
years ended december  and total revenue our total revenue increased by to million for from million for this increase was primarily attributable to the release of certain new products which began contributing to revenue in the second quarter of  a stronger direct sales presence internationally and an increase in sales to our existing customers 
license revenue 
license revenue increased by to million for from million for this increase was primarily due to sales of our amplify and synplify pro products which began contributing to revenue in the second quarter of  as well as stronger revenues from europe and japan 
maintenance revenue 
maintenance revenue increased by to million for from million for this increase was attributable to an increase in perpetual license sales with which we generally sell one year of maintenance support services  offset somewhat by a lower overall rate of maintenance renewal in compared to cost of revenue cost of license revenue 
our cost of license revenue decreased to  for from  for higher costs were incurred in due to documentation costs for a major product release as well as a greater amount of documentation shipped to customers 
as a percent of license revenue  the cost of license revenue decreased to less than for from for  primarily due to savings achieved in software documentation and shipping costs 
cost of maintenance revenue 
cost of maintenance revenue increased to million for from million for this increase was primarily caused by the hiring of additional customer support personnel to provide improved levels of support to a growing installed customer base 
as a percent of maintenance revenue  the cost of maintenance revenue decreased to for from for  primarily due to the increase in maintenance revenue during operating expenses research and development 
our research and development expenses increased to million for from million for this increase was primarily attributable to an increased number of software engineers we employed for the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products 
as a percent of total revenue  research and development expenses remained relatively consistent at for and sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased to million for from million for this increase was primarily due to the expansion of our sales offices  particularly in japan and other parts of asia  as well as higher spending on tradeshows and public relations 
as a percent of total revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased to for from for  primarily due to the increase in total revenue 

table of contents general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for as a percent of total revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to for from for these increases were the result of hiring additional finance and operations personnel  increased insurance expenses and increased legal  accounting  consulting and other costs associated with being a public company 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense was million for and  for stock based compensation expense for related to the following cost of maintenance revenue of  research and development expenses of  sales and marketing expenses of  and general and administrative expenses of  stock based compensation expense for related to the following cost of maintenance revenue of  research and development expenses of  sales and marketing expenses of  and general and administrative expenses of other income  net other income  net increased to million for from  for  primarily as a result of higher interest income from increased cash and investment balances 
the increased cash and investment balances were a result of cash proceeds from our initial public offering in october  as well as cash generated from operations 
in addition  we recorded a nonrecurring gain on the sale of long term investments of approximately  during income taxes we recorded a tax provision of  for which represented federal and state minimum taxes as well as foreign income taxes on international subsidiaries 
we incurred a loss in and  therefore  no provision was recorded in that year 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  an accumulated deficit of million and working capital of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and  for  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in from was primarily due to a net loss in compared to net income in and a lower increase in deferred revenue in the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in from was primarily due to net income in compared to a net loss in and a lower increase in accounts receivable in net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities during was mainly for acquisitions of products and technology as well as purchases of computers  software and furniture 
net cash used in investing activities during and was primarily for investments of cash received from our initial public offering and cash generated from operations  as well as purchases of computers  software and furniture as we expanded operations 
we expect to use approximately million of cash to purchase property and equipment during net cash provided by financing activities was  million and million for  and  respectively 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was from the sale of common stock as employees exercised stock options and purchased shares through our employee stock purchase plan  offset by repurchases of our stock 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily from the sale of common stock as employees exercised stock options and purchased shares through our employee stock purchase plan 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the sale of our series c preferred stock in march and the sale of common stock during our initial public offering in october 
table of contents the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by year total operating leases our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the amount  type and timing of product sales  the extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  the extent to which customers continue to renew annual maintenance  the timing of customer payments on outstanding receivables  the cost and timing of product development efforts and the success of these efforts  the cost and timing of sales and marketing activities  any acquisitions of products or technologies  the extent of stock repurchases  and the availability of financing 
we believe that our cash and short term investments balance of million as of december  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may require additional financing within this period 
for example  we used approximately million of cash during for acquisitions of products and technology and we intend to continue to invest in the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products 
in addition  even if we have sufficient funds to meet our anticipated cash needs in the next months  we may need to raise additional funds beyond this time 
we may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure that such funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we fail to raise capital when needed  our failure could have a negative impact on our profitability and our ability to pursue our business strategy

our adoption of the expanded disclosure requirements of this statement during the fourth quarter of did not have a material effect on our operating results or financial position 
factors affecting future operating results our sales and operating results have been  and may continue to be  negatively impacted by the adverse economic conditions  particularly in the united states we have experienced negative effects from the economic downturn in the united states  particularly in those markets with a heavier reliance on the networking and communications industry  and  to an extent  in europe and japan 
we have also experienced particular weakness in sales to startup companies 
many of our customers continue to tightly control spending and have reduced or delayed purchase orders 
additionally  in an effort to reduce near term spending  more customers have been seeking time based agreements  which causes us to recognize revenue ratably 
these conditions have resulted in a lower level of demand and revenue for our fpga products as well as longer sales cycles 
this downturn could continue or worsen  and may further extend to other geographic regions 
a continuation or worsening of current economic conditions in the market for fpga and asic software products  the health of networking and communications companies and the level of venture funding  or extension of such conditions to other geographic regions or industries  would continue to adversely affect our business 
we have a history of losses and may experience losses in the future  which could result in the market price of our common stock declining we had a net loss of million in  and have had significant net losses in the past  including net losses of million in and million in we expect to continue to incur significant levels of 
table of contents research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
if revenue does not increase or continues to decline  we may not be able to control our costs in order to achieve profitability 
if we are not profitable  the market price of our common stock may decline  perhaps substantially 
our expenses may increase in the next months as we reduce the cost control measures that were put in place during and  continue to incur research and development expenses to enhance our existing products and technologies  continue to develop additional logic synthesis  physical synthesis or other products  may expand our international direct sales force  may increase the size of our customer support organization  incur expenses related to the acquisition of products and technology from iota and bridgessilicon or other potential acquisitions 
any failure to significantly increase our new product bookings and revenue as we implement our product and distribution strategies would also harm our ability to achieve or maintain profitability and could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
our revenue could decline as a result of increases in sales of time based licenses we have recently seen an increase in the number and dollar amount of time based license agreements 
time based licenses as a percentage of total bookings increased in from we expect this trend to continue since customers may generally prefer time based licenses over perpetual licenses for our newer  higher priced products and customers who previously purchased perpetual licenses may choose to convert to time based licenses 
time based license agreements generally have terms from one to three years and we recognize revenue from them ratably over the term of the agreements 
increases in time based licenses could affect our revenue growth due to the delayed timing of revenue recognition for such licenses 
if our average selling price of time based licenses decreases  or if customers do not renew such licenses  our revenue could also decline 
any continued decline in our revenue  or lack of significant growth in our revenue  could result in a decrease in our stock price because our revenue may fail to meet the expectations of investment analysts and others 
our common stock may be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which will be beyond our control  which may prevent our shareholders from reselling our common stock at a profit the securities markets recently have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
for example  our stock traded between a high of and a low of during this market volatility  as well as general economic  market or political conditions including terrorist activity  war or other acts of violence  could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 
furthermore  because our stock generally trades at relatively low volumes  any sudden increase in trading volumes can cause significant volatility in the stock price 
in addition  our operating results could be below the expectations of investment analysts and investors  and in response  the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs  liabilities and a diversion of management s attention and resources 

table of contents our quarterly operating results and stock price may fluctuate because our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly sales is limited  our costs are relatively fixed in the short term and we expect our business to be affected by seasonality our ability to accurately forecast quarterly sales is limited  which makes it difficult to predict the quarterly revenue that we will recognize 
in addition  the time required to initiate and complete a sale for our fpga products is generally short  and our ability to foresee and react to changes in customer demand for our products may be limited and therefore inaccurate 
most of our costs are for personnel and facilities  which are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we have a shortfall in revenue in relation to our expectations  we may be unable to reduce our expenses quickly to avoid lower quarterly operating results 
consequently  our quarterly operating results could fluctuate  and the fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  in the past we have experienced fluctuations in the sale of licenses for our products due to seasonality 
for example  sales may decline during the summer months  particularly in european markets  and we have experienced and anticipate we will continue to experience relatively lower product bookings in our first quarter due to patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our current and prospective customers and the economic incentives for our sales force 
these factors may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on sales of our synplify  synplify pro and hdl analyst products for a substantial portion of our license revenue  and a decline in sales of these products could cause our license revenue to decline historically  we have derived a significant majority of our revenue from sales of our synplify  synplify pro and hdl analyst products 
license revenue for our synplify  synplify pro and hdl analyst products accounted for approximately  and of our license revenue in  and  respectively 
we expect that revenue from these products will continue to account for a majority of our license revenue for at least the next months 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of our licenses or demand for our synplify  synplify pro and hdl analyst products  including overall market conditions  competition or technological change  could cause our license revenue to decline and our business to suffer 
factors that may affect sales of our synplify  synplify pro and hdl analyst products  some of which are beyond our control  include the following continuing or worsening economic downturn in both domestic and foreign markets  the growth and changing requirements of the programmable semiconductor market  particularly with respect to fpgas  the performance  quality  price and total cost of ownership of our software products relative to other logic synthesis products for fpgas  and the maintenance and enhancement of our existing relationships with leading manufacturers of fpgas  which may provide us advance information or detailed data about those vendors fpgas and software 
we may not succeed in developing  marketing and selling new logic synthesis  physical synthesis and verification products  and our operating results may decline as a result we intend to develop additional logic synthesis  physical synthesis and verification products that leverage our core capabilities 
we also intend to develop new features for our existing products 
developing new products and new features for existing products that meet the needs of electronic product designers requires significant investments in research and development 
if we fail to introduce new products or enhanced versions of existing products in a timely and cost effective manner  our business could be negatively affected 
growing competition  technological changes that negatively affect the demand for fpgas and asics and our inexperience in selling our products to customers that design asics could also adversely affect our revenue 
if we fail to successfully identify  develop  market and sell new products and enhance our current products  our operating results will decline 

table of contents we introduced our certify product in and our amplify physical optimizer product in march we will need to continue to increase sales of these products in order to increase our revenue and regain profitability 
we introduced our synplify asic product in june  and began selling our acquired fortify powerplanner and realpower products in july and our acquired identify product in november our future growth and profitability will depend on our ability to gain market acceptance of our newly introduced products  especially our synplify asic product 
in addition  sales of our asic products may depend on a dedicated sales force that we have only recently begun to provide  or may require substantial training of our existing sales force 
we cannot be certain that our newer products  our entry into the asic logic synthesis product market or other new markets  or our acquired products  will be successful 
if customers do not widely adopt such products  our operating results could decline 
our revenue could decline substantially if our existing customers do not continue to purchase additional licenses or maintenance from us we rely on sales of additional licenses to our existing customers  as well as annual maintenance renewals for our products 
additional license sales to our existing customers represented approximately  and of our license sales in  and  respectively 
if we fail to sell additional licenses for our products to our existing customers  we would experience a material decline in revenue 
even if we are successful in selling our products to new customers  the level of our revenue could be harmed if our existing customers do not continue to purchase a substantial number of additional licenses from us or fail to renew their maintenance 
we have seen declines in our maintenance renewal rate including  but not limited to  the effects of customers unable to renew maintenance on some or all of their licenses due to business conditions or budget restrictions 
if we continue to experience this pressure  our maintenance revenue could stop growing or decline 
if we continue to experience an increase in the length of our sales cycle  our quarterly operating results could become more unpredictable and our stock price may decline as a result we experience sales cycles  or the time between an initial customer contact and completion of a sale  of generally two weeks to several months for our fpga products  depending on the product 
as a result of the current economic downturn  we have experienced an increase in the length of our sales cycle 
if we continue to experience such an increase in the length of our sales cycle  our quarterly operating results could suffer and our stock price could decline as a result 
the sales cycles for our certify product  our synplify asic product and our fortify products are substantially longer than that of our fpga products  which could result in additional unpredictability of our quarterly revenue 
since we have limited experience selling our new identify product  its sales cycles could be longer than we expect and could add to the unpredictability in our revenue from quarter to quarter 
in addition  for all of our products  customers often purchase a small number of licenses and then incrementally increase the number of licenses over time 
if customers were to implement enterprise wide evaluation programs or purchase products for the entire organization at one time  our sales cycle could lengthen and our revenue could be more unpredictable from quarter to quarter 
our business depends on continued demand for networking and communications equipment and other complex electronic equipment that incorporate fpgas or asics and our revenue may suffer if demand for this equipment continues to decline demand for networking and communications equipment declined during the last months due to reduced capital spending and delays in network build outs 
also  potential consumers of networking and communications equipment  such as communications companies  may use or modify existing types of equipment instead of adopting new networking and communications equipment 
if the business of networking and communications equipment manufacturers continues to decline  our revenue and business will suffer because our products are used to design a number of the fpgas or asics that are an integral part of networking and communications equipment 

table of contents the markets for fpgas and asics are evolving and if these markets do not develop and expand as we anticipate  our revenue may not increase or may decline because our products may not be needed we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to come from sales of our logic synthesis  physical synthesis and verification products 
we depend on the growing use of logic synthesis products to design fpgas for use in networking and communications  computer and peripheral  consumer  military aerospace and other electronics systems 
if the role of fpgas in these types of equipment does not increase  or decreases  our revenue would decline 
the fpga market may not expand if customers choose to use other semiconductors that might be more affordable or available with shorter time to market schedules 
this could cause electronic equipment manufacturers to limit the number of new fpgas they design and would reduce their need for our products 
we also depend on the continued adoption of asics 
if demand for our software products were to not grow as expected or decline  we may choose to lower the prices of our products or we may sell fewer licenses and have lower maintenance renewal rates 
in addition  if equipment manufacturers do not widely adopt the use of fpgas  or if there is a wide acceptance of alternative semiconductors that provide enhanced capabilities  the market price of our stock could decline due to our lower operating results or investors assessment that the growth potential for sales of our licenses is limited 
the markets for fpgas and asics are evolving and we cannot predict their potential sizes or future growth rates 
our success in generating revenue in these evolving markets will depend on  among other things  our ability to educate potential designers  networking and communications equipment manufacturers and other electronics companies about the benefits of fpgas and asics and the use of logic synthesis  physical synthesis and verification products to design them  establish and maintain relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers  electronic equipment designers  networking and communications equipment manufacturers and other electronics companies  and maintain and enhance our relationships with our other customers  and penetrate the asic synthesis marketplace with our new asic synthesis product  or otherwise significantly expand our market share of the asic tools market 
we depend on our marketing  product development and sales relationships with leading fpga manufacturers  and if these relationships suffer  we may have difficulty introducing and selling our fpga synthesis products and our revenue could decline we believe that our success in maintaining acceptance in the fpga market depends in part on our ability to maintain or further develop our strategic marketing  product development and sales relationships with leading fpga manufacturers  including altera corporation and xilinx  inc we believe our relationships with leading fpga manufacturers are important in validating our technology  facilitating broad market acceptance of our fpga synthesis products and enhancing our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
for example  we attempt to coordinate our product offerings with the future releases of altera s and xilinx s fpga components and software 
if we are unable to maintain and enhance our existing relationships with altera and xilinx and develop a similar relationship with other major fpga vendors  we may have difficulty selling our fpga synthesis products or we may not be able to introduce products on a timely basis that capitalize on new fpga component characteristics or software feature enhancements 
we need to develop our marketing  sales and product and library support relationships with leading asic manufacturers  and if we fail to do so  we may have difficulty selling our asic products and our revenue could be negatively impacted we believe that our success in penetrating the asic market depends in part on our ability to develop strategic marketing  sales and product and library support relationships with leading asic manufacturers 
we believe relationships with leading asic manufacturers are important in validating our technology  facilitating 
table of contents market acceptance of our asic products and enhancing our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
for example  we recently entered into relationships with asic vendors such as international business machines corporation  fujitsu and faraday technology corporation  to support our synplify asic product 
these companies have worked with us to qualify our software for their asic design flows 
in addition  we have recently announced a development and marketing agreement with nec corporation to optimize our synplify asic product for one of their device families 
if we are unable to expand these or continue to develop such relationships with other key asic manufacturers or do not do so in a timely manner  we may have difficulty selling our asic products 
in addition  we may not be able to enhance our products in a timely manner to capitalize on new asic component characteristics or software feature enhancements  which could negatively impact our revenue growth 
because we utilize channel partners to sell a portion of our products  our revenue could decline if our existing channel partners do not continue to purchase products from us we utilize semiconductor distributors insight electronics llc and arrow electronics to refer customers to us  which account for a portion of our license sales in north america 
a portion of our sales outside north america and japan are conducted through our channel partners 
sales to our channel partners accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
if we fail to sell our products through our existing channel partners  we could experience a decline in revenue 
in the past  we have terminated our relationships with certain channel partners for a number of reasons  including poor performance 
none of our existing channel partners is obligated to continue selling our products 
we face the risk that one or more of our channel partners will not continue to represent our products or that our channel partners will not devote a sufficient amount of effort and resources to selling our products in their respective territories 
if we are unable to staff our customer support organization to sufficiently meet the needs of our customers  we may not be able to retain our existing customers or attract new customers  and our revenues could decline as a result we may need to increase our customer support staff to support new customers and meet the expanding needs of our existing customers 
if our level of hiring is not adequate and we are unable to staff our customer support organization to sufficiently meet the needs of our customers  we may not be able to retain our existing customers  customers may not renew their maintenance or we may not be able to attract new customers 
we may not be able to effectively compete against other providers of products that design fpgas and asics as a result of their greater financial resources  product offerings and distribution channels  which could cause our sales to decline we face significant competition from larger companies that market suites of semiconductor design software products which address all or almost all steps of semiconductor design or which incorporate intellectual property components for semiconductors 
these competitors have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do 
we believe that cadence  mentor graphics and synopsys  each of which is also currently competing with us by marketing certain logic synthesis or verification products  could provide suites of products or individual products that include the functionality we currently provide in our products and at lower prices or they may otherwise have more favorable relationships with customers 
if these or other vendors provide lower cost logic synthesis  physical synthesis or verification products that outperform our products in addition to having broader applications of their existing product lines  our products could become difficult to sell 
in addition  we believe our asic synthesis product must provide substantially higher quality and value to potential customers for us to be successful in obtaining meaningful market share in the asic software tools market 
even if our competitors standard products offer functionality equivalent to that of our products  we face a substantial risk that a significant number of customers would elect to pay a premium for similar functionality rather than purchase products from a less well known vendor 
increased competition may negatively affect our business and future operating results by leading to price or market share reductions  or higher selling expenses 

table of contents our revenue could be reduced if large semiconductor design software companies make acquisitions in order to join their extensive distribution capabilities with our competitors products large semiconductor design software vendors  such as cadence  mentor graphics and synopsys  may acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our other current competitors  including private companies 
because large semiconductor design software vendors have significant financial and organizational resources  they may be able to further penetrate the logic synthesis  physical synthesis or verification markets by leveraging the technology and expertise of smaller companies and utilizing their own extensive distribution channels 
we expect that the semiconductor design software product industry will continue to consolidate 
for example  in june  synopsys completed its acquisition of avant corporation 
cadence completed its acquisitions of plato design systems  inc in april and simplex solutions  inc  whose products compete with our fortify family of products  in june additionally  mentor graphics completed cash tender offers for ikos systems  inc in march and for innoveda  inc 
in may it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share  which would harm our business and financial prospects 
we may face increased competition as a result of fpga manufacturers competing in the design software market or investing in emerging software companies fpga manufacturers currently compete in the fpga design software market by licensing their own synthesis products and or by distributing our competitors products 
for example  both altera and xilinx sell synthesis products that are competitive with our synplify and synplify pro products and could adversely impact the price or market for our fpga synthesis products or harm our business and financial prospects 
fpga manufacturers may also choose to assist  through financial  equity investment or other support  emerging eda software companies whose products could compete with or outperform ours 
a significant increase in the number of our competitors or competing products could reduce the value of our products in the market place and adversely affect our business 
our products are subject to rapid technological change and could be rendered obsolete and unmarketable the semiconductor design software market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
our products could be rendered obsolete if design products based on new technologies are introduced or new industry standards emerge 
for example  if customers widely adopt new engineering languages to describe their semiconductor designs and our products fail to support those languages adequately  our business will suffer 
we may sell fewer products and our revenue may decline if other vendors products are no longer compatible with ours or other vendors bundle their products with those of our competitors and sell them at lower prices our ability to sell our products depends in part on the compatibility of our products with other vendors semiconductor design software and verification hardware products 
these vendors may change their products so that they will no longer be compatible with our products 
some vendors already bundle their products with other logic synthesis  physical synthesis or verification products and sell the bundle at lower prices  and more vendors may do so in the future 
as a result  this may negatively affect our ability to offer commercially viable or competitive products 
we may not be able to preserve the value of our products intellectual property rights because we do not have an extensive patent portfolio  and other vendors could challenge our intellectual property rights our products are differentiated from those of our competitors by our internally developed technology that is incorporated into our products 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  other vendors could sell logic 
table of contents synthesis  physical synthesis or verification products with features similar to ours  which could reduce demand for our products 
we protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
we have filed a number of patent applications and to date have been issued six patents 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and generally seek to control access to our intellectual property rights and the distribution of our logic synthesis  physical synthesis and verification products  documentation and other proprietary information 
however  we believe that these measures afford only limited protection 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the copyrights and trade secrets we own 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise improperly obtain and use our products or technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as those in the united states 
for example  with respect to our sales and support operations in india  indian laws do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the united states  and indian statutory law does not protect service marks 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
our operating results would suffer if we were subject to a protracted infringement claim or a significant damage award substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in our industry 
we expect that logic synthesis  physical synthesis and verification products may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
we are not aware that our products employ technology that infringes any valid proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and or damage awards  divert our management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays  or require us to seek to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
a successful claim of product infringement against us or our failure to license the infringed or similar technology could adversely affect our business because we would not be able to sell the impacted product without exposing ourselves to litigation risk and damages 
furthermore  redevelopment of the product so as to avoid infringement would cause us to incur significant additional expense 
although we maintain general business insurance  it does not cover infringement claims 
we would be required to pay any damages and legal expenses from a successful claim ourselves 
in addition  because we also provide standard warranties against and indemnification for the potential infringement of third party intellectual property rights to our customers  we would be financially exposed to satisfy these obligations to our customers 
because our strategy to expand our international operations is subject to uncertainties  we may not be able to expand our presence in international markets or generate a significant level of revenue from those foreign markets customers outside north america accounted for approximately million  million and million of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
the dollar amount of our international sales must grow substantially in order for us to achieve and maintain profitability 
sales in europe and japan declined in from as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown 
a continuation or further decline 
table of contents in these economic conditions  or an extension of such conditions to additional international locations  would adversely impact our business 
we have international offices in the united kingdom  france  germany  the netherlands  sweden  israel  india  japan  korea and taiwan 
we also rely on indirect sales in asia  europe and elsewhere 
we have increased our international sales activities  but we still have limited experience in marketing and directly selling our products internationally 
our sales contracts generally provide for payment for our products in united states dollars 
however  direct sales to our customers in japan are in yen and we expect all such future sales there will be denominated in yen 
our expenses incurred in foreign locations are generally denominated in the respective local currency  and as a result  our future revenue and expense levels from international operations may be unpredictable due to exchange rate fluctuations 
in january  we began entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts designed to reduce our exposure to changes in the japanese yen 
the outstanding forward contracts generally have maturities of approximately one month from the date into which they were entered 
our international operations are subject to other risks  including relatively higher personnel and operating costs which may not result in additional revenue  revenue may not be sufficient to cover the expenses associated with establishing a new or expanded international location  the impact of local economic conditions  such as interest rate increases or inflation  which may lead to higher cost of capital and lower demand for products  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including tariffs  government ownership of communications systems or laws relating to use of and sales over the internet  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  including taxes due on the exercise of stock options or purchase of shares under employee plans by foreign employees and the impact of expiry of tax holidays or applicability of withholding or value added taxes  foreign currency fluctuations  and political instability  which may limit production of fpgas and or asics in asia or reduce government or private sector spending on networking and communications equipment 
we may not be successful in integrating the businesses or technologies that we acquire  or the expected benefits may not be realized as projected in  we acquired products and technology from iota and bridgessilicon 
we may make additional acquisitions in the future as a part of our efforts to increase revenue and expand our product offerings 
in addition to added direct costs  acquisitions pose a number of risks  including integration of the acquired products and employees into our business  integration of sales channels and training of our sales force for new product offerings  failure to realize expected synergies  failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales  assumption of unknown liabilities  and failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited experience 

table of contents while we make efforts to analyze acquisition candidates carefully  we cannot be certain that any completed acquisitions will positively impact our business 
future acquisitions could also subject us to significant asset impairment or restructuring charges 
significant errors in our products or the failure of our products to conform to specifications could result in our customers demanding refunds from us or asserting claims for damages against us because our logic synthesis  physical synthesis and verification products are complex  our products could fail to perform as anticipated or produce semiconductors that contain errors which go undetected at any point in the customers design cycle 
while we continually test our products for errors and work with users through our customer support service organization to identify and correct errors in our software and other product problems  errors in our products may be found in the future 
although a number of these errors may prove to be immaterial  many of these errors could be significant 
the detection of any significant errors may result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance and sales of our products  delays in shipping dates for our products  diversion of development resources from new products to fix errors in existing products  injury to our reputation  costs of corrective actions or returns of defective products  reduction in maintenance renewal rates  or product liability claims or damage awards 
we warrant that our products will operate in accordance with certain specifications 
if our products fail to conform to these specifications  customers could demand a refund for the purchase price or assert and collect on claims for damages 
although we maintain general business insurance  our coverage does not extend to product liability claims and we cannot assure that our resources would be sufficient to pay a damages award if one were to arise 
moreover  because our products are used in connection with other vendors products that are used to design complex fpgas and asics significant liability claims may be asserted against us if our products do not work properly  individually or with other vendors products 
our agreements with customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims 
however  these limitations may not preclude all potential claims and we do not insure against such liabilities 
regardless of their merit  liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation and divert management s attention from other business pursuits 
if successful  a product liability claim could require us to pay significant damages 
any claim  whether or not successful  could seriously damage our reputation and our business 
we rely on the services of key personnel  and those persons knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace our products and technologies are complex and we rely on experienced and knowledgeable research and development  customer support and sales personnel 
in particular  we depend substantially on the continued service of bernard aronson  our president and chief executive officer  kenneth s 
mcelvain  our chief technology officer  vice president and a founder  and robert erickson  our vice president of engineering 
there is a limited number of qualified people with the technical skills and understanding of fpgas and asics necessary to our business  and if we are unable to retain or find suitable replacements for any turnover in our engineering and sales organizations  our business could be adversely affected 

table of contents our officers and persons affiliated with our directors hold a substantial portion of our stock and could reject mergers or other business combinations that a shareholder may believe to be desirable as of december   our directors  officers and individuals or entities affiliated with our directors owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as a group 
acting together  these shareholders would be able to significantly influence all matters that our shareholders vote upon  including the election of directors or the rejection of a merger or other business combination that other shareholders may believe to be desirable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell those products primarily in north america  europe and japan 
our revenue from sales outside north america was approximately  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
with the exception of sales in japan  our sales are generally made in us dollars  thus a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
the functional currency for our foreign subsidiaries excluding japan is the united states dollar 
beginning january   the functional currency of our japanese subsidiary is the yen 
the effects of translation of our foreign subsidiaries for which the us dollar is the functional currency are included in the results of operations  and to date have not been material 
the effects of translation of our japanese subsidiary are included in shareholders equity and to date have not been material 
historically  our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations has been minimal 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by basis points from rates as of december   the effect on our operating results and financial position would not be material 
however  as our international sales and operations have expanded  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has increased  particularly in japan 
in january  we began entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts designed to reduce our exposure to changes in the japanese yen 
the outstanding forward contracts generally have maturities of approximately one month from the date into which they were entered 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the change in the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be material 
our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in obligations of the us government and its agencies  investment grade state and local government obligations  securities of us corporations rated a or p by standard poor s or the moody s equivalents  and or money market funds  deposits or notes issued or guaranteed by us and non us commercial banks meeting certain credit rating and net worth requirements with maturities of less than two years 
as of december   our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds and us government agency notes  and our short term investments consisted primarily of corporate notes  us government agency notes and certificates of deposit
