item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented account for commworks and palm as discontinued operations 
commworks is accounted for as a discontinued operation as a result of our decision to sell the business on march  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  all fiscal and prior amounts have been restated to reflect commworks results of operations as a discontinued operation 
palm is also accounted for as a discontinued operation as a result of our decision to distribute the palm common stock we owned to com stockholders in the form of a stock dividend 
we completed the sale of commworks on may  and distributed palm common stock to com stockholders on july  subsequent to those respective dates  commworks and palm s operations ceased to be part of our operations and reported results 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
overview in the fourth quarter of fiscal we undertook several broad initiatives aimed at driving revenue growth and cutting costs in an attempt to return com to profitability 
this included exiting certain product lines that were not expected to yield a satisfactory return on investment in the near term  and resulted in restructuring charges of million in fiscal after exiting these product lines and after restating our financial statements for discontinued operations as referred to above  we were organized around two continuing business units business connectivity company bcc and business networks company bnc 
these business units operated throughout all of fiscal during fiscal  we experienced continued declining revenues  which were most pronounced in bcc as a result of a shift in the market to less expensive  silicon based products 
in response to such conditions  in fiscal we undertook additional measures to further reduce costs  including headcount reductions  long term asset retirements  and outsourcing manufacturing that resulted in facilities consolidation 
we recorded million in restructuring charges in fiscal as a result of these actions 
in the first quarter of fiscal  as results continued to decline  we undertook several additional broad initiatives to achieve further cost savings 
the first of these actions included the integration of certain central functions of bcc and bnc in order to achieve cost savings  and restructuring charges resulted from this action 
this integration  however  did not substantially change our structure that consisted of our two ongoing operating units 
in fiscal  these business units were bcc and bnc 
effective for fiscal  our business units were connectivity  which included the majority of products previously managed under bcc  and enterprise networking  which included all of the products previously managed under bnc as well as certain wireless and security offerings that were formerly part of bcc 
in fiscal we saw the continued downward trend in revenue noted in fiscal in response to this trend  we took additional measures to reduce costs 
we continued to reduce headcount  outsourced certain information technology it functions  and continued our pursuit of selling excess facilities 
all of these actions generated restructuring charges  which totaled million in fiscal  but also resulted in reductions in sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses 
our results of operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal were particularly challenging 
we ended fiscal with lower revenues from enterprise networking products  down percent from the previous quarter 
this decrease was due to pricing and volume pressures  and was driven by particularly weak performance in the europe  middle east and africa region  which had represented approximately percent of our total revenues for the first three quarters of the year 
in addition  revenues from connectivity products were down percent sequentially  due to pricing pressures and the technology shift occurring in the market 
overall gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to percent for the previous quarter 
this decrease in gross margin was attributable to pricing pressures  an unfavorable change in product mix and an unfavorable impact of lower volume on capacity utilization in our one remaining operational manufacturing plant 
operating expenses excluding restructuring charges were essentially flat compared to the previous quarter  but increased significantly as a percent of revenues 
in particular  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues have been higher than our desired long term financial model 
as we enter fiscal  we continue to face significant challenges with respect to revenue  gross margin  and operating expenses 
we are taking a number of steps to address these challenges 
to increase revenues  we plan to expand our product portfolio to include more layer plus and higher end products  a full line of modular switches and routers  and a higher end voice over internet protocol ip offering 
we believe that such an expanded product portfolio will allow us to deliver converged voice and data networking solutions not only to our traditional customers but also to larger and multi site enterprises 
also  in order to drive increased sales of these higher end products  we are increasing our direct touch sales  service and support representatives 
to accommodate the difficult pricing environment that we expect to face for the foreseeable future  we are making efforts to reduce costs and expenses 
beginning in fiscal  we are consolidating our company s operations into a single operating segment  and we are relocating key management positions and functions from our santa clara  california facility into our marlborough  massachusetts location as a more effective way to run this simplified business model 
also  we are consolidating our operations into fewer facilities and disposing of excess real estate holdings  relocating transaction processing activities to lower cost locations  and upgrading and modifying our it infrastructure and systems to more cost effective alternatives 
in addition  we recently announced our intention to reduce our overall workforce by approximately ten percent 
much of this reduction in our workforce will affect general and administrative expenses  which we are targeting to be in the range of million to million per quarter beginning in the second half of fiscal as compared to million for the most recent quarter 
in the near term  we expect that some of the steps that we are taking will result in continuing downward pressure on income from continuing operations 
for example  sales and marketing expenses will increase as a result of additions to our direct sales  service and support representatives 
also  general and administrative expenses will increase due to relocation and recruiting costs associated with the relocation of key management positions and functions from santa clara to marlborough 
however  we believe that the steps that we are taking are appropriate at this time and fully consistent with our goals of increasing revenues and restoring profitability 
our planned actions for fiscal are based on certain assumptions concerning the nature  severity  and duration of the current economic downturn affecting the networking industry and the cost and expense structure of our business 
these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate 
if current economic conditions deteriorate to an unexpected degree  or if our planned actions are not successful in achieving our goals  there could be additional adverse impacts on our financial position  revenues  profitability or cash flows 
in that case  we might need to modify our strategic focus and restructure our business again to realign our resources and achieve additional cost and expense savings 
on march   we announced an agreement to form a joint venture with huawei technologies  ltd 
that will be domiciled in hong kong with principal operations in hangzhou  china 
we will contribute to the joint venture million in cash  assets related to our operations in china and japan  and licenses to our related intellectual property in exchange for percent ownership of the joint venture 
operations of the joint venture are expected to begin in the second quarter of fiscal  pending regulatory approval in china and satisfactory implementation of it systems 
as mentioned above  starting in fiscal we are combining our enterprise networking and connectivity segments  and will manage and report the business as a single segment
