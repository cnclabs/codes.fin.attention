item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein 
industry trends the events of the last two years as delineated below and their aftermath impacted both the oem and the maintenance  repair and overhaul markets 
the most direct impact from these events was an immediate reduction in commercial air travel 
according to the air transport association  commercial air travel for the month of september  as measured by revenue passenger miles flown  was down approximately from august and down approximately compared to september this significant decline was followed by a slow  but steady  recovery  with revenue passenger miles down approximately in october and down only approximately in august when compared to prior year periods 
beginning in september and continuing through february  revenue passenger miles were up each month compared to prior year periods 
although the combined effect of the recent iraq conflict and the outbreak of sudden acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  have again negatively impacted commercial air travel  we believe that overall trends should continue to improve 
however  demand for air travel is affected by a number of factors  including the absolute level of general economic activity 
the decline in demand for air travel has negatively impacted the operating performance and profitability of the worldwide airline industry 
as a result  many airlines have reduced their fleet size by temporarily grounding or permanently retiring older and less cost efficient aircraft 
new aircraft orders have fallen and certain airlines have begun to delay or cancel scheduled deliveries of new aircraft 
new commercial aircraft deliveries declined approximately in versus  based upon the most recent data provided by boeing and airbus 
notwithstanding this reduction  the actual deliveries for represent the fifth highest number of deliveries in any of the prior ten years 
in addition to deferring new aircraft purchases  many airlines elected to defer certain optional maintenance and refurbishment activities in order to minimize total cash outlays in response to weaker air travel demand 
a significant portion of maintenance  repair and overhaul activity required on commercial aircraft is mandated by government regulation that limits the total time or number of flights that may elapse between scheduled maintenance  repair and overhaul mro events 
as a result  although short term deferrals are possible  maintenance  repair and overhaul activity is ultimately required to continue to operate the aircraft in revenue producing service 
therefore  over the intermediate and long term  trends in the maintenance  repair and overhaul market are closely related to the size and utilization level of the worldwide aircraft fleet  as reflected by the number of available seat miles  commonly referred to as asms  flown 
according to the airline monitor  since worldwide asms have grown every year but  and the negative effects of the events of september   sars  the war in iraq  along with the already prolonged outlook for the commercial air travel downcycle  have led to a reduced forecast for a turnaround in large commercial oem deliveries until at the earliest 
the current lack of a pick up in air travel also impacts the supplier base  as mro work remains curtailed and  in order to preserve cash  airlines are only performing retrofits absolutely necessary for safety reasons 
the trends have been somewhat offset by increased demand for new and replacement military equipment in support of stronger national defense and a renewed emphasis on homeland security 
followed by a period of budget decreases in the post cold war era  the us defense budget  as appropriated by congress  has continued to increase in recent years 
under the bush administration  the us defense budget has seen the first double digit increase since the early s 
the us defense budget request totaled approximately billion and the bush administration has proposed increasing these spending levels to over billion by fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales 
net sales remained virtually unchanged at million for fiscal from the prior year period 
a decline in net sales due to a decrease in commercial airframe build rates was offset by revenue increases from certain military programs  most significantly the c and f e f programs  and from the positive impact from the acquisition of efs aerospace  inc efs in fiscal and from the acquisitions of certain assets of ozone industries  inc in april  and substantially all of the assets of aerocell structures  inc in july  furst aircraft and instrument in august  and the boeing company s spokane fabrication operation in january  collectively  the acquisitions 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal costs of products sold increased as a percentage of sales primarily due to lower operating rates in relation to fixed costs  significant increases in healthcare costs and from the acquisition of efs and the acquisitions  partially mitigated by reductions in employee incentive payments and employee benefits 
included in the net increase in cost of goods sold is a million gain recognized during fiscal  related to the modification of employee benefit plans 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the reasons discussed above 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  due to increases in healthcare costs  liability insurance premiums  as well as the inclusion of efs and the acquisitions  partially offset by a reduction in employment costs which resulted from a reduction in headcount and reductions in employee incentive payments and employee benefits 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to an increase in depreciation as a result of capital expenditures made over the last twelve months and from the assets acquired in connection with the inclusion of efs and the acquisitions 
special charge 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge totaling million related to the write off of design and development costs related to a new aircraft program  which we deemed unlikely to go into production 
operating income 
operating income decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
the net decrease in operating income from the prior year period resulted from the decrease in gross profit  most notably from the decrease in commercial airframe build rates discussed above and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by the operating profits from the inclusion of efs and the acquisitions 
interest expense and other 
interest expense and other decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates  partially offset by increased borrowing resulting from the acquisition of efs  the acquisitions and our capital expenditure program 
income tax expense 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal discontinued operations 
in march  the company declared its metals businesses metals to be discontinued operations and expects to sell these businesses in fiscal these businesses that comprise the discontinued operations manufacture  machine  process and distribute metal products to customers in the computer  container and office furniture industries  primarily within north america  as well as structural steel erection services 
the company has stated that it would retain metals due to its positive cash flows that were used to fund the growth of its aviation businesses 
however  the company has decided to focus on its core capabilities in aviation and sell metals 
loss from discontinued operations before income taxes was million for fiscal compared with income from discontinued operations before income taxes of million for fiscal the benefit for income taxes was million in fiscal compared to a provision of million in the prior year period 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
this growth in revenue was due to our increased participation in the expanding regional jet market  namely the canadair rj programs  growth of participation in airbus programs  primarily the a  a and a programs and participation in certain military programs  most significantly the c and f programs 
revenue growth was also helped by the positive impact of license agreements and product lines obtained in fiscal and from the acquisition of efs 
increases in certain boeing program deliveries  namely the b new generation and b  added to the growth of net sales in fiscal over the prior year period offset by declines in other programs  most notably the e c 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the increase in sales and the acquisition of efs 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the reasons discussed above 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  due to a general increase in expenses as well as the acquisition of efs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized 
in accordance with sfas  we stopped amortizing goodwill effective april  had sfas been effective april   depreciation and amortization would have increased million  or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in amortization related to our purchase of certain licenses and a product line that we acquired at the end of the second quarter of fiscal and an increase in depreciation due to our capital expenditure program 
special charge 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge totaling million related to the write off of design and development costs related to a new aircraft program  which we deemed unlikely to go into production 
operating income 
operating income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
had sfas been effective april   operating income for fiscal would have been million or million more than reported 
during fiscal  we incurred approximately million of amortization and royalty expenses related to our purchase of certain licenses and a product line which we acquired at the end of the second quarter of fiscal compared to approximately million for the prior year period 
interest expense and other 
interest expense and other decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year period 
this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and decreased debt levels from the follow on public offering  which occurred in march and april of income tax expense 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations before income taxes was million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year period 
the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
we generated approximately million of cash flows from operating activities for the year ended march   used approximately million in investing activities and raised approximately million in financing activities for the year ended march  in december  we issued two classes of senior notes million of class a notes and million of class b notes 
the class a notes carry a fixed rate of interest of and mature on december  the class b notes carry a fixed rate of interest of and mature in seven annual installments of million starting on december  through december  the proceeds of the senior notes were used to pay down our revolving credit facility credit facility 
in conjunction with the issuance of the senior notes  we amended our credit facility to reduce the credit limit from million to million  extend the expiration date thereof from june  to december  and amend certain terms and covenants 
the credit facility bears interest at either libor plus between and or the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus if greater or an overnight interest rate at our option 
the variation in the interest rate is based upon our ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  we are required to pay a commitment fee of between and on the unused portion of our credit facility 
as of march   million was available under our credit facility 
on march   an aggregate amount of approximately million was outstanding under the credit facility  million of which was accruing interest at libor plus applicable basis points totaling per annum  and million of which was accruing interest at the overnight rate of per annum 
amounts repaid under our credit facility may be reborrowed 
on august   we entered into a loan agreement with the illinois development finance authority related to the illinois development finance authority economic development bonds  series of the bonds 
the proceeds of the bonds of million were used to fund the purchase of our triwestern metals subsidiary s new electro galvanizing production line 
the bonds were due to mature on august  and were secured by the equipment 
in november  we retired all of the outstanding bonds totaling million  plus accrued interest 
the retirement of the bonds was funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
in november  we retired million of subordinated promissory notes and million of junior subordinated promissory notes  which were included in other debt 
the retirement of the subordinated promissory notes and junior subordinated promissory notes were funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
capital expenditures were approximately million for the year ended march   primarily for manufacturing machinery and equipment 
we funded these expenditures through borrowings under our credit facility 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million for our fiscal year ending march  the expenditures are expected to be used mainly to expand capacity at several facilities 
in april  we acquired certain assets of ozone industries  inc in july  we acquired substantially all of the assets of aerocell structures  inc  located in hot springs  arkansas  which is being operated by our subsidiary  airborne nacelle services  inc in august  we acquired substantially all of the assets of furst aircraft and instrument  located in teterboro  new jersey  which is being operated by our subsidiary  furst aircraft  inc the total cash paid at these closings of approximately million was funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
in november  we acquired the remaining four percent of the stock of our subsidiary  triumph controls  inc the cash purchase price paid at closing of million was funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
in january  we acquired substantially all of the assets of the boeing company s spokane fabrication operation  located in spokane  washington 
the acquired business  which was renamed triumph composite systems  inc  adds new products and new capabilities to our portfolio of structural component products and services 
triumph composite systems is dedicated to the production of aircraft parts made of composite and thermoplastic materials 
primary products include floor panels  air control system ducts and nonstructural composite flight deck components 
as part of the transaction  we have entered into an eight year single source supply agreement with the boeing company for the products currently produced by triumph composite systems 
the purchase price of approximately million  which was paid in cash at closing for this acquisition  was funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
in may  we acquired certain assets of parker hannifin s united aircraft products division for million  which will be operated by our subsidiary triumph thermal systems 
this purchase was funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
on december   we announced a program to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock 
in march  we repurchased a total of  shares at an average share price of 
from the inception of the program through march   we have repurchased a total of  shares for a total purchase price of million 
our expected future cash flows for the next five years for long term debt  leases and other obligations are as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt      capital lease obligations    operating leases      operating leases discontinued operations   other long term obligations  total      included in our balance sheet at march  includes interest component 
we believe that cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations 
however  we have a stated policy to grow through acquisition and are continuously evaluating various acquisition opportunities 
as a result  we currently are pursuing the potential purchase of a number of candidates 
in the event that more than one of these transactions are successfully consummated  the availability under our credit facility might be fully utilized and additional funding sources may be needed 
there can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on terms favorable to us  if at all 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the appropriate allowance  we consider a combination of factors  such as industry trends  our customers financial strength and credit standing  and payment and default history 
the calculation of the required allowance requires a judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identification methods and consist of finished goods available for sale 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  inventory adjustments may be required 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with invoice terms  generally when products are shipped or services are rendered 
our policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances  except at our option 
accruals for sales returns  other allowances  and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience 
if actual future sales returns  allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience  additional amounts may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
additionally  intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
requires a two step impairment test for goodwill 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step is required to be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and record any resulting impairment losses annually 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates 
we completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that there was no impairment 
discontinued operations we account for our metals businesses as discontinued operations because we plan to sell these businesses 
accounting treatment for discontinued operations involves segregation of the net assets and operating results of the discontinued operations for separate disclosure in the financial statements  rather than including the results within the other line items of the financial statements 
we have determined that the metals businesses meet the held for sale criteria of current accounting requirements as of march  judgments and estimates were used in reaching this conclusion 
a different interpretation of current accounting literature that concluded discontinued operation accounting did not apply would have a significant impact on the financial statements  increasing revenues  operating expenses  assets and liabilities  although shareholder s equity would remain the same 
market risk our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings 
an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our operating results and the cash flow available after debt service to fund operations and expansion 
in addition  an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock  if permitted to do so under certain of our debt arrangements  including our revolving credit facility 
we manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by optimizing the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and should be read in conjunction with note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the following table presents principal cash flows and the related interest rates 
fixed interest rates disclosed represent the weighted average rate as of march  variable interest rates disclosed fluctuate with the libor  federal funds rates and other weekly rates and represent the weighted average rate at march  expected years of maturity next months months months months months thereafter total fixed rate cash flows in thousands    weighted average interest rate variable rate cash flows in thousands weighted average interest rate forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of relating to our future operations and prospects  including statements that are based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate  and management s beliefs concerning future performance and capital requirements based upon current available information 
such statements are based on management s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
when used in this document  words like may  might  will  expect  anticipate  believe  potential  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from management s current expectations 
for example  there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required or that additional capital  if required  will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such times and in such amounts as may be needed by us 
in addition to these factors  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are uncertainties relating to the integration of acquired businesses  general economic conditions affecting our business segments  dependence of certain of our businesses on certain key customers as well as competitive factors relating to the aviation and metals industries
