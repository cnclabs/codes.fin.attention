item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
at the end of item is a glossary of terms 
item business general harvest natural resources  inc is an independent energy company engaged in the development and production of oil and gas properties since  when it was incorporated under delaware law 
we have developed significant interests in the bolivarian republic of venezuela venezuela and the russian federation russia through our equity affiliate  and have undeveloped acreage offshore china 
our producing operations are conducted principally through our percent owned venezuelan subsidiary  benton vinccler  ca benton vinccler  which operates the south monagas unit in venezuela  and limited liability company geoilbent geoilbent  a russian company of which we own percent and which operates the north gubkinskoye and south tarasovskoye fields in west siberia  russia 
on february   we entered into a sale and purchase agreement to sell our entire percent interest in arctic gas company arctic gas  to a nominee of the yukos oil company  a russian oil and gas company  for million plus approximately million as repayment of inter company loans owed to us by arctic gas the arctic gas sale 
on april   we completed the arctic gas sale and recognized a gain of million million after tax 
from december  through february   no sales of our venezuelan oil production were made because of petroleos de venezuela  sa s pdvsa inability to accept our oil due to the national civil work stoppage in venezuela 
in restoring production  we encountered problems with some of our wells  but we do not believe the associated costs will be material 
by the end of march  our average production was approximately  barrels of oil per day 
on february   the venezuelan government imposed currency controls 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations for a complete description of these events 
as of december   we had total estimated proved reserves  net of minority interest and including our share of equity affiliates  of mmboe  and a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow  before income taxes  for total proved reserves of million 
of these totals  our interests in the south monagas unit represented mmboe and million  and our equity interest in geoilbent represented mmbbls and million  respectively 
as of december   we had total assets of million 
for the year ended december   we had total revenues of million  net cash provided by operating activities of million  and long term debt of million 
for the year ended december   we had total revenues of million  net cash provided by operating activities of million  and long term debt of million

in addition  the company has adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of its employees  including its chief executive officer  principal financial officer and principle accounting officer 
the text of the code of ethics has been posted on the governance section of the company s website 
operating strategy our business strategy supports the steady investment  prudent risk management and timely development of our large hydrocarbon resources 
for the foreseeable future  we believe our best success will be found in venezuela and russia  areas in which we have significant experience and expertise 
near term  our strategy is focused on improving the realization of value from our current operations in both venezuela and russia 
investments in venezuela and russia are exposed to significant political risks 
in venezuela  we intend to continue to seek cost effective increases in production to extend the life and value of our fields 
completing a gas project in the fourth quarter of within budget is an important part of this strategy because it creates a new source of revenues from sales of natural gas 
we are also looking for ways to diversify our cash flow as events in venezuela demonstrated the benefits of country risk diversification of our cash flow sources when we lost six weeks of production 
our russian operations are an important element of our diversification strategy 
we and the majority share owner in geoilbent continue to strive to improve operations and monetize the value of the fields by lowering operating costs and enhancing financial results 
the geoilbent assets represent significant potential value for us  but remain subject to sub optimal operating conditions while our lack of majority control over its operations inhibits our ability to implement necessary changes in management  operations or financing matters to fully realize the potential of geoilbent s assets 
in addition  our financial results have been significantly hampered by low russian domestic oil prices while world oil prices have reached multi year high levels 
geoilbent s independent accountants have indicated in their report that substantial doubt exists regarding geoilbent s ability to meet its debts as they become due and continue as a going concern 
an important part of our near term strategy is to establish and implement a plan to maximize the value of our investment in geoilbent by improving its operations  achieving a control position or selling our minority ownership interest 
we believe that russia has opportunities and that we  as an independent oil and gas operator  can exploit using western management and operating techniques 
the overall goal is to add undeveloped or underdeveloped resources of oil and gas 
through phased investment  we can then increase and capture the long term value of the asset 
we seek significant  legacy assets  with a controlling ownership interest in partnership with local industry partners 
these partners must understand and be familiar with the asset and area s working environment 
our long term strategy is founded on three guiding principles enable  manage risk and value harvest 
we enable by using our experience and skills to identify  access and exploit large known resources of hydrocarbons in underexploited areas that can be developed at low overall finding costs  produced at low operating costs and converted into proved reserves  production and value 
we manage risk by controlling or mitigating the many factors within our control  such as continuing to improve our operating risks  access to markets and financing flexibility 
we value harvest our existing assets by rapid development to convert underdeveloped hydrocarbons into cash 
we intend to continue to seek and exploit new oil and natural gas reserves in current areas of interest while working toward minimizing the associated financial and operating risks 
to reduce these risks  not only in seeking new reserves  but also with respect to our existing operations  we o focus our efforts in areas of low geologic risk we intend to focus our activities only in areas of large known but undeveloped oil and gas resources 
o establish a local presence through joint venture partners and the use of local personnel we seek to establish a local presence in our areas of operation to facilitate stronger relationships with local government and labor 
in addition  using local personnel helps us to take advantage of local knowledge and experience and to minimize costs 
in pursuing new opportunities  we will seek to enter at an early stage and find local investment partners in an effort to reduce our risk in any one venture 
o commit capital in a phased manner to limit total commitments at any one time we often agree to minimum capital expenditure or development commitments at the outset of new projects  but we endeavor to structure such commitments so that we can fulfill them over time  thereby limiting our initial cash outlay  as well as maximize the amount of local financing capacity to develop the hydrocarbons and associated infrastructure 
o limit exploration activities we do not engage in exploration except in conjunction with the expansion of an existing reservoir 
our ability to successfully execute our strategy is subject to significant risks including  among other things  operating risks  political risks and financial risks 
operating risks include our ability to maintain optimal production  achieve maximum reserve recovery and maintain our cost structure on an economically favorable basis  particularly in geoilbent in which we are a minority owner 
political risks in venezuela are significant  and while currently partially abated  could again have a negative influence on our operations and our financial flexibility 
in russia  the oil and gas business is evolving  but remains subject to local laws and customs  local market operation and powerful domestic oil and gas companies 
our company is also solely dependent upon sales of oil and gas  once the venezuelan gas project is completed  to fund our operations and service our debt requirements 
interruptions in benton vinccler s production and cash flow would erode our financial flexibility and hinder our ability to execute our operating strategy 
in addition  venezuela recently imposed foreign currency exchange controls which could increase our costs of operations 
operations the following table summarizes our proved reserves  drilling and production activity  and financial operating data by principal geographic area at the end of each of the three years ending december  all venezuelan reserves are attributable to an operating service agreement between benton vinccler and pdvsa under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 
geoilbent and arctic gas are accounted for under the equity method and have been included at their respective ownership interests in our consolidated financial statements 
our year end financial information contains results from our russian operations based on a twelve month period ending september accordingly  our results of operations for the years ended december   and reflect results from geoilbent for the twelve months ended september   and  and from arctic gas  until it was sold on april   for the twelve months ended september  and we own percent of benton vinccler 
the reserve information presented below is net of a percent deduction for the minority interest in benton vinccler

these fields comprise the south monagas unit 
we were the first us company since to be granted such an oil field development contract in venezuela 
the oil and natural gas operations in the south monagas unit are conducted by benton vinccler  our percent owned subsidiary 
the remaining percent of the outstanding capital stock of benton vinccler is owned by vinccler 
through our majority ownership of stock in benton vinccler  we make all operational and corporate decisions related to benton vinccler  subject to certain super majority provisions of benton vinccler s charter documents related to o mergers  o consolidations  o sales of substantially all of its corporate assets  o change of business  and o similar major corporate events 
vinccler has an extensive operating history in venezuela 
it provided benton vinccler with initial financial assistance and significant construction services 
vinccler continues to provide ongoing assistance with construction projects  governmental relations and labor relations 
under the terms of the operating service agreement  benton vinccler is a contractor for pdvsa 
benton vinccler is responsible for overall operations of the south monagas unit  including all necessary investments to reactivate and develop the fields comprising the south monagas unit 
the venezuelan government maintains full ownership of all hydrocarbons in the fields 
in addition  pdvsa maintains full ownership of equipment and capital infrastructure following its installation 
the operating service agreement provides for benton vinccler to receive an operating fee for each barrel of crude oil delivered 
it also provides benton vinccler with the right to receive a capital recovery fee for certain of its capital expenditures  provided that such operating fee and capital recovery fee cannot exceed the maximum total fee per barrel set forth in the agreement 
the operating fee is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the special energy index of the us consumer price index 
the maximum total fee is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the average of certain world crude oil prices 
since  the maximum total fee received by benton vinccler has approximated percent of west texas intermediate crude oil wti price 
benton vinccler has constructed a mile oil pipeline from its oil processing facilities at uracoa to pdvsa s storage facility  the custody transfer point 
the operating service agreement specifies that the oil stream may contain no more than one percent base sediment and water 
quality measurements are conducted both at benton vinccler s facilities and at pdvsa s storage facility 
in january  benton vinccler installed a continuous flow measuring unit at its facility to closely monitor the quantities of hydrocarbons delivered to pdvsa 
at the end of each quarter  benton vinccler prepares an invoice to pdvsa based on barrels of oil accepted by pdvsa during the quarter  using quarterly adjusted contract service fees per barrel 
payment is due under the invoice by the end of the second month after the end of the quarter 
invoice amounts and payments are denominated in us dollars 
payments are wire transferred into benton vinccler s account in a commercial bank in the united states 
while pdvsa has timely paid its past invoices  payment of the invoice for the fourth quarter deliveries was seven days late 
pdvsa indicated that the late payment was due to business interruptions resulting from the national civil work stoppage in venezuela 
natural gas sales contract on september   benton vinccler and pdvsa signed an amendment to the operating service agreement  providing for the delivery of up to bcf of natural gas through july at a price of per mcf 
natural gas sales are expected to commence at a rate of to mmcf of natural gas per day in the fourth quarter of and gradually increase up to mmcfpd in to months from the initial sale 
in addition  benton vinccler agreed to sell to pdvsa million barrels of oil at per barrel beginning with our first gas sale 
initial gas production will come from uracoa  which allows us to more efficiently manage the reservoir and eliminate the restrictions on producing oil wells with high gas to oil ratios 
the gas reserves in bombal will be used to meet the future terms of the gas contract in or an initial capital investment of approximately million will be required to build a mile pipeline with a normal capacity of mmcf of natural gas per day and a design capacity of mmcf of natural gas per day  a gas gathering system  upgrades to the um plant facilities and new gas treatment and compression facilities 
we plan to start fabrication and construction process for the gas pipeline in early benton vinccler has borrowed million under a project loan for the gas pipeline and related facilities and the remainder will be funded from existing cash balances and internally generated cash flow 
location and geology the south monagas unit extends across the southeastern part of the state of monagas and the southwestern part of the state of delta amacuro in eastern venezuela 
the south monagas unit is approximately miles long and eight miles wide and consists of  acres  of which the fields comprise approximately one half of the acreage 
at december   proved reserves attributable to our venezuelan operations were  mboe  mboe net to harvest 
this represented approximately percent of our proved reserves at year end 
benton vinccler has been primarily developing the oficina sands in the uracoa field 
the uracoa field contains percent of the south monagas unit s proved reserves 
benton vinccler is currently reinjecting most of the associated natural gas produced at uracoa back into the reservoir 
drilling and development activity benton vinccler drilled oil and water injection wells in and had an average of wells on production in all fields in uracoa field benton vinccler has been developing the south monagas unit since  beginning with the uracoa field 
benton vinccler processes the oil  water and natural gas produced from the uracoa field in the uracoa central processing unit 
benton vinccler ships the processed oil via pipeline to the pdvsa custody transfer point 
benton vinccler treats and filters produced water  and then re injects it into the aquifer to assist the natural water drive 
benton vinccler re injects natural gas into the natural gas cap primarily for storage conservation 
the major components of the state of the art process facility were designed in the united states and installed by benton vinccler 
this process design is commonly used in heavy oil production in the united states  but was not previously used extensively in venezuela to process crude oil of similar gravity or quality 
the current production facility has capacity to handle mbbls of oil per day  mbbls of water per day  and to mmcf of natural gas per day 
in august  benton vinccler sold its power generation facility located in the uracoa field for million 
concurrently with the sale  benton vinccler entered into a long term power purchase agreement with the purchaser of the facility to provide for the electrical needs of the field throughout the remaining term of the operating service agreement 
tucupita and bombal fields in  benton vinccler reactivated nine wells in tucupita and in completed eleven oil producers and two water injectors 
the oil is transported through a mile  mbbl per day capacity oil pipeline constructed in from tucupita to the uracoa central processing unit 
benton vinccler is reinjecting produced water from tucupita into the aquifer to aid the natural water drive and we utilize a portion of the associated natural gas to operate a power generation facility to supply our power needs 
to date  we have drilled one well in the bombal field and reactivated another 
customers and market information under the operating service agreement  oil produced is delivered to pdvsa for an operating fee 
from december  through february   no sales were made because of pdvsa s inability to accept our oil due to the national civil work stoppage in venezuela 
as a result  sales were reduced by approximately  barrels 
in restoring production  we encountered problems with some of our wells  but we do not believe the associated costs will be material 
by the end of march  our average production was approximately  barrels of oil per day 
while we have substantial cash reserves  a prolonged loss of sales could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
employees and community relations benton vinccler has a highly skilled staff of local employees and expatriates and has also formed successful and supportive relationships with local government agencies and communities 
benton vinccler has invested in a social community program that includes medical programs in ophthalmologic and dental care  as well as additional social investments including the purchase of medicines and medical equipment in local communities within the south monagas unit 
health  safety and environment benton vinccler s health  safety and environmental policy is an integral part of its business 
annually  benton vinccler continually improves its policy and practices related to personnel safety  property protection and environmental management 
these improvements can be directly attributed to the efforts in accident prevention programs and the training and implementation of a comprehensive process safety management system 
north gubkinskoye and south tarasovskoye  russia geoilbent general in december  the joint venture agreement forming geoilbent was registered with the ministry of finance of the ussr 
in november  the agreement was registered with the russian agency for international cooperation and development 
geoilbent was later re chartered as a limited liability company 
purneftegazgeologia and purneftegaz co founding shareholders contributed their interest to open joint stock company minley minley in geoilbent s current ownership is as follows o harvest percent 
o minley percent 
we believe that we have developed a good relationship with minley and have not experienced any disagreements on major operational matters 
we are reviewing ways to improve the operations  but as a minority shareholder we may not be able to fully effect changes in operations  if indicated as necessary or desirable by our review 
geoilbent shareholder action requires a percent majority vote of its shareholders 
geoilbent s oil and gas fields are situated on land belonging to the russian federation 
geoilbent obtained licenses from the local authorities and pays unified production taxes to explore and produce oil and gas from these fields 
licenses will expire in september for the north gubkinskoye field  and in march for the south tarasovskoye field 
however  under paragraph of the russian federal law fz  dated january   the license may be extended over the economic life of the lease at geoilbent s option 
geoilbent intends to extend such licenses for properties that are expected to produce subsequent to their expiry dates 
estimates of proved reserves extending past the license expiration currently represent approximately percent of total proved reserves 
location and geology geoilbent develops  produces and markets crude oil from the north gubkinskoye and south tarasovskoye fields in the west siberia region of russia  located approximately  miles northeast of moscow 
large proved oil and gas fields surround all four of geoilbent s licenses 
the north gubkinskoye field is included inside a license block of  acres  an area approximately miles long and four miles wide 
the field has been delineated with over exploratory wells  which tested separate reservoirs 
the field is a large anticlinal structure with multiple pay sands 
the development to date has focused on the cretaceous bp    and reservoirs with minor development in the bp  and jurassic reservoirs 
geoilbent is currently flaring the produced natural gas in accordance with environmental regulations  although it is exploring alternatives to construct a natural gas processing plant and to market the natural gas and natural gas liquids 
the south tarasovskoye field is located southeast of north gubkinskoye field and straddles the eastern boundary of the urabor yakhinsky exploration block acquired by geoilbent in it is estimated that a majority of the field is situated within the block 
the remaining portion of the field falls within a license block owned by purneftegaz 
production began in early from a discovery well drilled close to the boundary by purneftegaz 
only of geoilbent s  acres in this field are reflected as proved developed acres 
the development to date has focused on the cretaceous bp   and  and the jurassic reservoirs 
all of the current production in south tarasov is achieved from the main anticlinal feature 
geoilbent also holds rights to two more license blocks comprising  acres in the west siberia region of russia 
drilling  development  customer and market information currently there are wells in production in north gubkinskoye and in production in south tarasovskoye 
in addition  there are and injectors  respectively  currently injecting water in each field 
until geoilbent began operations in  the north gubkinskoye field was one of the largest non producing oil and gas fields in the region 
geoilbent transports its oil production to transneft  the state oil pipeline monopoly 
transneft then transports the oil to the western border of russia for export sales or to various domestic locations for non export sales 
trading companies such as rosneftegasexport handles all export oil sales  which are paid in us dollars into geoilbent s bank account 
in  approximately of geoilbent s production was sold in the world export market and in the domestic russian market 
geoilbent s domestic russian crude oil price declines significantly in the winter months 
for example  during the period from september  until december  in this same period  russian export prices increased from approximately to per barrel  however  geoilbent s average price declined in value between these two periods 
geoilbent could not export more crude oil due to transneft and the winter export limitations 
geoilbent is continuing to pursue its oil development program 
the current production facilities are operating at or near capacity and will need to be expanded to accommodate future production increases 
currently gas production from north gubkinskoye is consumed as fuel with the remainder being flared 
in  geoilbent secured a loan from the european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd to develop a portion of the oil and condensate reserves of the north gubkinskoye field 
the outstanding debt balance of million on the debt to ebrd has been restructured into a new million loan facility  which will be used to reduce payables and implement the south tarasovskoye oil development in on march  geoilbent drew million under the loan to reduce payables 
however  there can be no assurance that this draw on the credit facility will be adequate to permit geoilbent to meet the current financial ratio requirement under the credit facility 
if geoilbent fails to meet the ratio requirements for two consecutive quarters it will result in an event of default whereby ebrd may  at its option  demand payment of the outstanding principal and interest 
in addition  the restructured loan agreement requires that geoilbent implement a new management information system by may  geoilbent will be unable to timely satisfy this requirement which also results in an event of default whereby ebrd may  at its option  demand payment of the outstanding principal and interest 
for a more complete description of the terms and conditions of the ebrd loan and geoilbent s covenant obligations  see item risk factors and note russian operations 
employees  community and country relations geoilbent employs six expatriates working with geoilbent and local employees 
we have conducted community relations programs  providing medical care  training  equipment and supplies in towns in which geoilbent personnel reside and also for the nomadic indigenous population which resides in the area of oilfield operations 
east urengoy  russia arctic gas company arctic gas company was sold in april see note russian operations 
wab  south china sea benton offshore china company general in december  we acquired crestone energy corporation  subsequently renamed benton offshore china company 
its principal asset is a petroleum contract with china national offshore oil corporation cnooc for the wab area 
the wab petroleum contract covers million acres in the south china sea  with an option for an additional million acres under certain circumstances  and lies within an area which is the subject of a territorial dispute between the people s republic of china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with another company 
the territorial dispute has lasted for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the area under dispute 
as part of our review of company assets  we conducted a third party evaluation of the wab area 
through that evaluation and our own assessment  we recorded a million impairment charge in the second quarter of location and geology the wab contract area is located approximately miles southeast of the dai hung big bear oil field 
the block is adjacent to british petroleum s giant natural gas discovery at lan tay red orchid and miles north of exxon s natuna discovery 
the contract area covers several similar structural trends  each with potential for hydrocarbon reserves in possible multiple pay zones 
drilling and development activity due to the sovereignty issues between china and vietnam  we have been unable to pursue an exploration program during phase one of the contract 
as a result  we have obtained a license extension  with the current extension in effect until may  domestic operations we had a percent working interest in the lakeside exploration prospect  cameron parish  louisiana 
in september  we determined the claude boudreaux exploratory well was not prospective for hydrocarbons and assigned our entire interest in the lakeside exploration prospect to a third party and recognized a million impairment 
we acquired a percent interest in three california state offshore oil and gas leases california leases and a parcel of onshore property from molino energy company  llc 
all capitalized costs associated with the california leases have been fully impaired 
the california leases have expired and the company has issued the required quitclaim deed  is plugging and abandoning the previously drilled exploratory wells and will undertake any required lease and land reclamation 
it is believed that these costs will not be material 
activities by area the following table summarizes our consolidated activities by area

the following table sets forth information regarding estimates of proved reserves at december  the venezuelan information includes reserve information net of a percent deduction for the minority interest in benton vinccler 
all venezuelan reserves are attributable to an operating service agreement between benton vinccler and pdvsa under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 
russia s reserves reflect our percent equity interest in geoilbent 
although we estimate there are substantial natural gas reserves in the license blocks held by geoilbent  no natural gas reserves have been recorded as of december  because of a lack of sales and transportation contracts in place 
net crude oil and condensate mbbls proved proved developed undeveloped total venezuela    russia    total    net natural gas mmcf proved proved developed undeveloped total venezuela    estimates of commercially recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of the future net cash flows derived there from are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as o historical production from the subject properties  o comparison with other producing properties  o the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies  and o assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  export tariffs  abandonment costs  development costs  workover and remedial costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
all such estimates are to some degree speculative and various classifications of reserves are only attempts to define the degree of speculation involved 
for these reasons  estimates of the commercially recoverable reserves of oil attributable to any particular property or group of properties  the classification  cost and risk of recovering such reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected there from  prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially 
the difficulty of making precise estimates is accentuated by the fact that percent of our total proved reserves were undeveloped as of december  the following costs therefore will likely vary from our estimates and such variances may be material o severance and excise taxes  o export tariffs  o development expenditures  o workover and remedial expenditures  o abandonment expenditures  and o operating expenditures 
reserve estimates are not constrained by the availability of the capital resources required to finance the estimated development and operating expenditures 
in addition  actual future net cash flows will be affected by factors such as o actual production  o oil sales  o supply and demand for oil and natural gas  o availability and capacity of gathering systems and pipelines  o changes in governmental regulations or taxation  and o the impact of inflation on costs 
the timing of actual future net oil and natural gas sales from proved reserves as well as the year end price  and thus their actual present value  can be affected by the timing of the incurrence of expenditures in connection with development of oil and gas properties 
the percent discount factor required by the sec to be used to calculate present value for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time  risks associated with the oil and natural gas industry and the political risks associated with operations in venezuela and russia 
discounted present value  regardless of what discount rate is used  is materially affected by assumptions as to the amount and timing of future production  which assumptions may and often do prove to be inaccurate 
for the period ending december   we reported million of discounted future net cash flows before income taxes from proved reserves based on the sec s required calculations 
production  prices and lifting cost summary in the following table we have set forth by country our net production  average sales prices and average operating expenses for the years ended december   and the presentation for venezuela includes percent of the production  without deduction for minority interest 
geoilbent percent ownership and arctic gas and percent ownership not subject to any sale or transfer restrictions at december and  respectively  which are accounted for under the equity method  have been included at their respective ownership interest in the consolidated financial statements based on a fiscal period ending september and  accordingly  our results of operations for the years ended december   and reflect results from geoilbent for the twelve months ended september   and  and from arctic gas until it was sold on april   and for the twelve months ended september  and year ended december  venezuela crude oil production bbls    average crude oil sales price per bbl average operating expenses per bbl geoilbent a net crude oil production bbls    average crude oil sales price per bbl average operating expenses per bbl arctic gas a b net crude oil production bbls b   average crude oil sales price per bbl b average operating expenses per bbl b a information represents our ownership interest 
b arctic gas was sold on april  regulation general our operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate 
in particular  oil and natural gas production operations and economics are affected by o change in governments  o civil unrest  o price and currency controls  o limitations on oil and natural gas production  o world demand for crude oil  o tax and other laws relating to the petroleum industry  o changes in such laws  and o changes in administrative regulations and the interpretation and application of such rules and regulations 
in any country in which we may do business  the oil and natural gas industry legislation and agency regulation are periodically changed for a variety of political  economic  environmental and other reasons 
numerous governmental departments and agencies issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry  some of which carry substantial penalties for the failure to comply 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business 
venezuela on february   venezuela imposed currency controls and created the commission for administration of foreign currency cadivi with the task of establishing the detailed rules and regulations and generally administering the exchange control regime 
these controls fix the exchange rate between the bolivar and the us dollar  and restrict the ability to exchange bolivars for dollars and vice versa 
oil companies such as benton vinccler are allowed to receive payments for oil sales in us currency and pay dollar denominated debt  dividends and expenses from those payments 
we are unable to predict the impact of the currency controls on us or benton vinccler because the cadivi has not issued final regulations 
the near term effect has been to restrict benton vinccler s ability to make payments to employees and vendors in bolivars  causing it to borrow money on a short term basis to meet these obligations 
as of march   these short term borrowings have been repaid and while we now have bolivars to meet our current obligations  the situation could change 
in addition  the currency controls have increased the cost of benton vinccler s bolivar denominated debt 
we plan to prepay the bolivar denominated debt as of march  venezuela requires environmental and other permits for certain operations conducted in oil field development  such as site construction  drilling  and seismic activities 
as a contractor to pdvsa  benton vinccler submits capital budgets to pdvsa for approval including capital expenditures to comply with venezuelan environmental regulations 
no capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations were required in benton vinccler also submits requests for permits for drilling  seismic and operating activities to pdvsa  which then obtains such permits from the ministry of energy and mines and ministry of environment  as required 
benton vinccler is also subject to income  municipal and value added taxes  and must file certain monthly and annual compliance reports to the national tax administration and to various municipalities 
russia geoilbent submits annual production and development plans  which include information necessary for permits and approvals for its planned drilling  seismic and operating activities  to local and regional governments and to the ministry of fuel and energy and the ministry of natural resources 
geoilbent submits annual production targets and quarterly export nominations for oil pipeline transportation capacity to the ministry of fuel and energy 
geoilbent is subject to customs  value added and municipal and income taxes 
various municipalities and regional tax inspectorates are involved in the assessment and collection of these taxes 
geoilbent must file operating and financial compliance reports with several agencies  including the ministry of fuel and energy  ministry of natural resources  committee for technical mining monitoring and the state customs committee 
effective in august  a new tariff structure on exported oil was instituted 
the russian government sets the maximum crude oil export tariff rate as a percentage of the customs dollar value of urals  russia s main crude export blend 
under the current system when the urals price is in a range of to per ton to per bbl a tariff of percent is imposed on the sum exceeding the level of 
when urals crude is below per ton no tariff is collected 
when the price rises above per ton  exporters pay a combined tariff comprising per ton  plus a tariff of percent on the sum exceeding 
by way of example  a ural price per barrel would incur an export tariff of per barrel 
effective january   mineral restoration tax  royalty tax and excise tax on crude oil production were abolished and replaced by the unified natural resources production tax 
through december   the base rate for the unified natural resources production tax is set at russian rubles per metric ton of crude oil produced and is to be adjusted on the market price of urals blend and the russian ruble us dollar exchange rate 
the tax rate is zero if the urals blend price falls to or below per barrel 
from january   the unified natural resources production tax rate is set by law at percent of crude oil revenues recognized by geoilbent based on regulations on accounting and reporting of the russian federation 
we are unable to predict the impact of future taxes  duties and other burdens on geoilbent s operations

the principal competitive factors in the acquisition of such oil and gas properties include political  staff and data necessary to identify  investigate and purchase such leases  and the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop such leases 
many of our competitors have financial resources  staffs  data resources and facilities substantially greater than ours 
environmental regulation various federal  state  local and international laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  may affect our operations and costs 
we are committed to the protection of the environment and believe we are in substantial compliance with the applicable laws and regulations 
however  regulatory requirements may  and often do  change and become more stringent  and there can be no assurance that future regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
employees at december   we had full time employees  augmented from time to time with independent consultants  as required 
benton vinccler had and geoilbent had local employees 
title to developed and undeveloped acreage all venezuelan reserves are attributable to an operating service agreement between benton vinccler and pdvsa  under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 
with regard to russian acreage  geoilbent has obtained license agreements and other documentation from appropriate regulatory agencies in russia which we believe is adequate to establish their right to develop  produce and market oil and natural gas from their fields 
the wab petroleum contract lies within an area which is the subject of a territorial dispute between the people s republic of china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with a third party 
the territorial dispute has existed for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the area under dispute 
it is uncertain when or how this dispute will be resolved  and under what terms the various countries and parties to the agreements may participate in the resolution

capital expenditures 
capital expenditures means costs associated with exploratory and development drilling including exploratory dry holes  leasehold acquisitions  seismic data acquisitions  geological  geophysical and land related overhead expenditures  delay rentals  producing property acquisitions  and other miscellaneous capital expenditures 
completion costs 
completion costs means  as to any well  all those costs incurred after the decision to complete the well as a producing well 
generally  these costs include all costs  liabilities and expenses  whether tangible or intangible  necessary to complete a well and bring it into production  including installation of service equipment  tanks  and other materials necessary to enable the well to deliver production 
development well 
a development well is a well drilled as an additional well to the same reservoir as other producing wells on a lease  or drilled on an offset lease not more than one location away from a well producing from the same reservoir 
exploratory well 
an exploratory well is a well drilled in search of a new and as yet undiscovered pool of oil or natural gas  or to extend the known limits of a field under development 
finding cost 
finding cost  expressed in dollars per boe  is calculated by dividing the amount of total capital expenditures related to acquisitions  exploration and development costs reduced by proceeds for any sale of oil and gas properties by the amount of total net reserves added or reduced as a result of property acquisitions and sales  drilling activities and reserve revisions during the same period 
future development cost 
future development cost of proved nonproducing reserves  expressed in dollars per boe  is calculated by dividing the amount of future capital expenditures related to development properties by the amount of total proved non producing reserves associated with such activities 
gas cap 
gas cap is the natural gas trapped above the oil in a reservoir 
gross acres or wells 
gross acres or wells are the total acres or wells  as the case may be  in which an entity has an interest  either directly or through an affiliate 
net acres or wells 
a party s net acres or net wells are calculated by multiplying the number of gross acres of gross wells in which that party has an interest by the fractional interest of the party in each such acre or well 
operating expenses 
operating expenses are the expenses of lifting oil from a producing formation to the surface  consisting of the costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities  including labor costs  repair and maintenance  supplies  insurance  production and severance taxes 
producing properties or reserves 
producing reserves are proved developed reserves expected to be produced from existing completion intervals now open for production in existing wells 
producing properties are properties to which producing reserves have been assigned by an independent petroleum engineer 
proved developed reserves 
proved developed reserves are proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved reserves 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known oil and natural gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  that is  on the basis of prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made and any price changes provided for by existing conditions 
proved undeveloped reserves 
proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
reserves 
reserves means crude oil and natural gas  condensate and natural gas liquids  which are net of leasehold burdens  are stated on a net revenue interest basis  and are found to be commercially recoverable 
standardized measure of future net cash flows 
the standardized measure of future net cash flows is a method of determining the present value of proved reserves 
the future net oil sales from proved reserves are estimated assuming that oil and natural gas prices and production costs remain constant 
the resulting stream of oil sales is then discounted at the rate of percent per year to obtain a present value 
undeveloped acreage 
undeveloped acreage is oil and natural gas acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit commercial production regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves 
item properties in july  we leased office space in houston  texas for three years for approximately  per month

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating the company 
our concentration of assets in venezuela increases our exposure to production declines and disruptions 
during  the production from the south monagas unit in venezuela represented all of our total production from consolidated companies 
our production  revenue and cash flow will be adversely affected if production from the south monagas unit decreases significantly for any reason 
from december  through february   no sales were made because of pdvsa s inability to accept our oil due to the national civil work stoppage in venezuela 
as a result  sales were reduced by approximately  barrels and sales in were reduced by an estimated million barrels 
while the situation has stabilized  there continues to be political and economic uncertainty that could lead to another disruption of our sales 
in restoring production  we encountered problems with some wells  but we do not believe the associated costs will be material 
by the end of march  our average production was approximately  barrels of oil per day 
as a result of the national civil work stoppage  the government of venezuela terminated several thousand pdvsa employees and announced a decentralization of pdvsa s operations 
while the effect of these changes cannot be predicted  it could adversely affect pdvsa s ability to manage its contracts and meet its obligations with its suppliers and vendors  such as benton vinccler 
as a result of the situation in pdvsa  its payment to benton vinccler for crude delivered in the fourth quarter was late by seven days 
we believe that the payment demonstrates pdvsa s commitment to building its production levels back to full capacity and returning to more normalized business relations with its customers and suppliers 
while we have substantial cash reserves to withstand a future disruption  a prolonged loss of sales or a failure or delay by pdvsa to pay our invoices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we have been required to curtail sales to pdvsa in april and december due to insufficient crude oil storage capacity 
we have never been required to curtail sales before we cannot be assured that our sales to pdvsa will not be curtailed in the future in the same manner 
geoilbent s liquidity could limit its ability to maintain or increase production 
ability to comply with credit facility 
the million revolving credit agreement with ebrd requires that geoilbent meet certain covenants which include  among other things  the maintenance of financial ratios 
if geoilbent fails to meet the ratio requirements for two consecutive quarters it will result in an event of default whereby ebrd may  at its option  demand payment of the outstanding principal and interest 
in addition  the loan agreement requires that geoilbent implement a new management information system by may  if geoilbent is unable to timely satisfy this requirement  it also results in an event of default whereby ebrd may  at its option  demand payment of the outstanding principal and interest 
any event of default also gives ebrd the right to exercise its security interest in the assets of geoilbent and  under a share pledge agreement  our ownership interest in geoilbent 
an event of default could also limit geoilbent s ability to access additional funds under the ebrd facility 
it is unlikely that geoilbent will be able to timely implement a new management information system as required by the ebrd loan facility 
further  while on march   geoilbent has drawn down million on the ebrd facility to meet its current liabilities  there can be no assurance that geoilbent will be able to meet the current ratio requirement on march  as a result of these events geoilbent s independent accountants have indicated in their report that substantial doubt exists regarding geoilbent s ability to meet its debts as they come due and continue as a going concern 
while no assurance can be given  the company believes these covenant defaults are temporary and does not result in an other than temporary decline in the company s investment in geoilbent or will cause ebrd to declare a default after considering geoilbent s historical net income  cash flow from operating activities and other matters 
ability to repay accounts payable 
at september   and september   the current liabilities of geoilbent exceeded its current assets by million and million  respectively 
included in current liabilities as of september  are loans repayable to ebrd million and imb million 
the imb liability was repaid in november this debt has been classified as current because of geoilbent s status under the ebrd loan 
at december   geoilbent had accounts payable outstanding of million of which approximately million was days or more past due 
the amounts outstanding were primarily to contractors and vendors for drilling and construction services 
under russian law  creditors  to whom payments are days or more past due  can force a company into involuntary bankruptcy 
we believe most of the significantly overdue payables have now been paid as a result of the million draw down of the ebrd facility 
ability to repay our loan 
as of september   the geoilbent shareholders had provided geoilbent with subordinated loans totaling million million from harvest and million from minley 
these loans are unsecured and repayable commencing in january our interest rate is based on libor up to january  and rises from to percent thereafter 
there can be no assurance that geoilbent will have the ability to repay the loan made by the company when due 
ability to maintain or increase production 
because of geoilbent s significant working capital deficit  a substantial portion of its cash flow must be utilized to reduce accounts and taxes payable 
additionally  in order to maintain or increase proved oil and gas reserves  geoilbent must make substantial capital expenditures in geoilbent s net cash provided by operating activities is dependent on the level of oil prices  which are historically volatile and are significantly impacted by the proportion of production that geoilbent can sell on the export market 
historically  geoilbent has supplemented its cash flow from operations with additional borrowings or equity capital 
should oil prices decline for a prolonged period  or if geoilbent is unable to access the ebrd facility or the shareholders are unwilling to make capital contributions  then geoilbent would need to reduce its capital expenditures  which could limit its ability to maintain or increase production and  in turn  meet its debt service requirements 
although the company may consider making a capital contribution  there can be no assurances that the company will do so  nor can there be any assurances that geoilbent s other shareholder will be willing or able to do so 
asset sales and financing are restricted under the terms of the ebrd loan 
our minority interest in geoilbent may limit our ability to influence change 
we own percent in geoilbent 
we are reviewing ways to improve operations  such as the secondment of expatriate employees or consultants  the upgrading of drilling equipment  improved operating techniques and economic decision making  but we are a minority partner and therefore may not be able to fully influence changes in the operations 
our operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations  and our strategy to focus on venezuela and russia limits our country risk diversification 
our operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  war  insurrection  civil unrest  strikes and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations 
our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  taxation and the possibility of having to be subject to exclusive jurisdiction of courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts in the united states 
our strategy to focus on venezuela and russia concentrates our foreign operations risk and increases the potential impact to us of the operating  financial and political risks in those countries 
our foreign operations expose us to foreign currency risk 
our principal operations are in venezuela and russia which have historically been considered highly inflationary economies 
results of operations in those countries are re measured in united states dollars  and all currency gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
there are many factors which affect foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our influence 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan and russian currencies to the united states dollar 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates 
our venezuelan receipts are denominated in us dollars  and most expenditures are in us dollars as well 
for a discussion of currency controls in venezuela  see capital resources and liquidity below 
new york stock exchange delisting 
in october  we received a letter from the new york stock exchange nyse notifying us that we had fallen below the continued listing standard of the nyse 
these standards include a total market capitalization of at least million over a day trading period and stockholders equity of at least million 
according to the nyse s notice  our total market capitalization over the trading days ended october  was million and our stockholders equity was million as of september  in accordance with the nyse s rules  we submitted a plan to the nyse detailing how we expected to reestablish compliance with the listing criteria within the next months 
in january  the nyse accepted our business plan  subject to quarterly reviews of the goals and objectives outlined in that plan 
by april  the total market capitalization and stockholder s equity deficiencies were eliminated  and as of december   we remained in compliance with nyse listing standards 
leverage materially affects our operations 
as of december   our long term debt was million 
our long term debt represented percent of our debt to total capital at december  our current cash balances lessen the impact of our debt but it can effect our operations in several important ways  including the following o a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is used to pay interest on borrowings  o the covenants contained in the indentures governing our debt limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of assets  o the covenants contained in the indentures governing our debt affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  o the level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes  and o the terms of the indentures governing our debt permit our creditors to accelerate payments upon an event of default or a change of control 
oil price declines and volatility could adversely affect our revenue  cash flows and profitability 
prices for oil fluctuate widely 
the average price we received for oil in venezuela increased to per bbl for the year ended december   compared to per bbl for the year ended december  our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth depend substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to service our debt 
in addition  we may have ceiling test writedowns when prices decline 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil that we can produce economically 
we cannot predict future oil prices 
factors that can cause this fluctuation include o relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil  o market uncertainty  o the level of consumer product demand  o weather conditions  o domestic and foreign governmental regulations  o the price and availability of alternative fuels  o political and economic conditions in oil producing countries  and o overall economic conditions 
lower oil and natural gas prices may cause us to record ceiling limitation writedowns 
we use the full cost method of accounting to report our oil and natural gas operations 
accordingly  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce stockholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
no ceiling test write downs were required in estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
this form k contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the securities and exchange commission relating to oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
such process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
actual production  revenue  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses with respect to our reserves will likely vary from the estimates used 
such variances may be material 
at december   approximately percent of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped 
undeveloped reserves  by their nature  are less certain 
recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the estimates of our future reserves include the assumption that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop these reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results will be as estimated 
see supplemental information on oil and natural gas producing activities 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues referred to is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in demand  our ability to produce  or in governmental regulations or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the percent discount factor  which is required by the securities and exchange commission to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and our risks or the risks associated with the oil and natural gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the percent discount factor 
we may not be able to replace production with new reserves 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics 
our reserves will decline as they are produced unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities 
our future oil production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain 
we may be unable to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
we cannot assure you that our future exploration  development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
our operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and natural gas drilling and production activities 
oil and natural gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found 
the cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain 
oil and natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include o unexpected drilling conditions  o pressure or irregularities in formations  o equipment failures or accidents  o weather conditions  o shortages in experienced labor  o shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment  and o delays in receipt of permits or access to lands 
the prevailing price of oil also affects the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs  production equipment and related services 
we cannot assure you that the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 
drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable 
drilling activities can result in dry wells and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs 
the oil and natural gas industry experiences numerous operating risks 
the oil and natural gas industry experiences numerous operating risks 
these operating risks include the risk of fire  explosions  blow outs  pump and pipe failures  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards 
environmental hazards include oil spills  natural gas leaks  pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these industry operating risks occur  we could have substantial losses 
substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
the events of september  forced changes to our insurance coverage 
acts of terrorism are excluded risks from our property insurance coverage 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
competition within the industry may adversely affect our operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
we compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties and the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations that materially affect our operations 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various foreign governmental regulations 
these regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions 
matters regulated may include permits for discharges of wastewaters and other substances generated in connection with drilling operations  bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well plugging and abandonment costs  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
at various times  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on oil and gas production 
in order to conserve or limit supplies of oil and natural gas  these agencies have restricted the rates of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity 
we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
financial and operational performance we had two overriding strategic priorities for i to reduce the amount of debt on the balance sheet  and ii to improve the value of our producing assets 
we also strengthened our management team and recommitted  as a management team and board of directors  to maintain the highest standards in corporate governance  financial transparency and business ethics 
in may  the shareholders approved our name change to harvest natural resources  inc in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares of our common stock 
as of march   we have repurchased approximately  shares for an aggregate price of million 
the balance sheet was significantly strengthened by completing the sale of arctic gas which produced million in cash and net proceeds  after taxes and expenses  of million including million for repayment of our intercompany debt and were used  in part  to redeem all of the million of percent senior notes due in may an additional million of the million of percent senior notes due in november were also retired 
the balance of the proceeds were retained to improve our financial flexibility and to be available for acquisitions  reduction of debt or other general corporate purposes 
this strategy has already been partially rewarded by our ability to maintain our financial flexibility in spite of the loss of production temporarily as a result of the national civil work stoppage in venezuela 
at december   we had million of cash or marketable securities and a debt to total capital ratio of percent compared with over percent at the end of we also improved the value of our production  an equally important second priority 
we have lowered the cash costs lease operating  general and administrative of our produced barrel by percent year on year to approximately per barrel  increasing unit profitability 
we also successfully negotiated a contract to sell bcf of natural gas to pdvsa over the next years 
establishing a market for this gas allowed us to record an additional net mmboe of reserves in in  geoilbent  in which we have a interest  was able to improve production 
geoilbent increased production by percent to million barrels per year and has begun restructuring its balance sheet  by converting the loan with ebrd into a million revolving line of credit 
subject to availability  this credit facility will allow geoilbent to reduce its current liabilities and accelerate the development of the south tarasovskoye oil field in western siberia 
however  as discussed above under geoilbent liquidity  significant issues exist over geoilbent continuing as a going concern 
capital program benton vinccler s capital expenditures for are projected to be to million  compared with capital expenditures of million 
to partially fund its capital program  benton vinccler borrowed million in october for the construction of the pipeline and related facilities to deliver gas to pdvsa 
benton vinccler has also hedged a portion of its oil production by purchasing a wti crude oil put to protect part of its cash flow 
in january  we completed our tucupita field development program in venezuela 
in  benton vinccler plans to drill three oil wells in the bombal field and construct a pipeline from bombal to the tucupita delivery line 
benton vinccler also plans to convert two gas injection wells in uracoa to gas production 
other capital projects relate to the gas project and facilities improvements 
geoilbent s capital expenditures for are projected to be approximately million 
in  geoilbent plans to drill up to eighteen wells in south tarasovskoye and to commence a comprehensive work over program in north gubkinskoye 
an appraisal well is planned in to delineate a potential south extension of the south tarasovskoye field that will be developed with further drilling if successful 
geoilbent expects to fund the south tarasovskoye drilling program through draw downs from the ebrd loan facility 
for a description of the ebrd loan agreement and a discussion of geoilbent s compliance with the covenants and possible liquidity problems  see geoilbent s liquidity above and note russian operations 
results of operations we include the results of operations of benton vinccler in our consolidated financial statements and reflect the percent ownership interest of vinccler as a minority interest 
we account for our investments in geoilbent and arctic gas using the equity method 
we include geoilbent and arctic gas in our consolidated financial statements based on a fiscal year ending september our results of operations for the year ended december   reflect the results of geoilbent and arctic gas until sold on april  for the twelve months ended september   and you should read the following discussion of the results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  and the financial condition as of december  and in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
we have presented selected expense items from our consolidated income statement as a percentage of crude oil sales in the following table years ended december  operating expenses depletion  depreciation and amortization general and administrative taxes other than on income interest years ended december  and net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with million for the same period last year 
the million net income included the after tax gain from the arctic gas sale of million  and the pre tax million  partial recovery of a bad debt related to a 
e 
benton see note related party transactions  offset  in part  by a pre tax million impairment of the wab petroleum property located in the south china sea 
operating and general and administrative expenses were reduced by million  or almost percent compared with our results of operations for the year ended december  primarily reflected the results for benton vinccler in venezuela  which accounted for all of our production and oil sales revenue 
as a result of increases in world crude oil prices  partially offset by lower production from the south monagas unit  oil sales in venezuela were percent higher in compared with realized fees per barrel increased percent from in to in 
our revenues increased million  or percent  during the year ended december   compared with this was due to increased oil sales revenue in venezuela as a result of increases in world crude oil prices  partially offset by lower sales quantities 
our sales quantities for the year ended december  from venezuela were mmbbls compared to mmbbls for the year ended december  the decrease in sales quantities of  bbls  or less than percent  was due primarily to logistics and equipment delays in early at the tucupita field and the national civil work stoppage which led to the shut in of our production in late december for nine days 
average production for the year decreased by less than bbls per day for the aforementioned reasons 
our operating expenses decreased million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  lower fuel gas  water and oil treatments accounted for million of the reduction 
reduced workover expense million and lower expenses associated with the transportation of tucupita oil million with the completion of the tucupita oil pipeline in late were offset by million of increases in various other categories 
depletion  depreciation and amortization increased million  or percent  during the year ended december   compared with primarily due to the first three quarters of having been calculated on the lower beginning of the year reserves 
we added bcf or mmboe in the fourth quarter which will impact this calculation prospectively 
depletion expense per barrel of oil produced from venezuela during was compared with during primarily due to future development costs 
we recognized write downs of capitalized costs of million associated with wab offshore china and million for the lakeside prospect exploration activities during the year ended december   compared with million associated with final costs associated with prior exploration activities 
general and administrative expenses decreased million from to the move to houston was completed in and overall staff levels were reduced to the current level of ten in houston 
we recognized million of income for the partial recovery of prior year bad debt allowance for the funds received from the ae benton bankruptcy 
the consideration includes  shares of stock taken into treasury at a price of per share and approximately million in cash 
taxes other than on income decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december   compared with this was primarily due to decreased venezuelan municipal taxes and a one time adjustment of us employment taxes of million 
investment income and other decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december   compared with this was due to lower interest rates earned on average cash and marketable securities balances 
interest expense decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december   compared with we redeemed all million of our percent senior notes due in may and purchased million face of the percent senior notes due in november in october  we borrowed under a million loan to finance the construction of the gas pipeline in venezuela from the uracoa field to the pdvsa sales line 
net gain on exchange rates increased million  or percent for the year ended december   compared with this was due to the significant devaluation of the bolivar 
we realized income before income taxes and minority interest of million during the year ended december   compared with million in the increase was dominated by the arctic gas sale 
the income tax benefit related to the potential utilization by the arctic gas sale of net operating loss carry forwards in the effective tax rate of percent reflects the approximate rate for venezuela and no tax benefits are being recognized for expenses incurred in the us the income attributable to the minority interest increased million for the year ended december   compared with this was primarily due to the increased profitability oil prices and reduced expenses of benton vinccler 
equity in net earnings of affiliated companies decreased million  during the year ended december   compared with this was primarily due to the decreased income from geoilbent and the elimination of arctic gas equity income on april   the date of its sale 
geoilbent s equity income declined from million in to million in we recorded equity in net losses of arctic gas in both years 
revenues from geoilbent were million for the year ended september   compared with million for the decrease of million  or percent  was due to lower russian domestic crude oil prices offset by higher sales quantities 
prices for geoilbent s export crude oil averaged per bbl and its domestic crude oil averaged during the year ended september   compared with per bbl for export crude oil and for domestic for the year ended september  our share of geoilbent oil sales quantities increased by  bbls  or percent  from  bbls sold during the year ended september   to  bbls sold during the year ended september  years ended december  and our results of operations for the year ended december  primarily reflected the reversal of our tax valuation allowance and results for benton vinccler in venezuela  which accounted for all of our production and oil sales revenue 
as a result of decreases in world crude oil prices  partially offset by higher production from the south monagas unit  oil sales in venezuela were percent lower in compared with realized fees per barrel decreased percent from in to in and oil sales quantities increased percent from mmbbls of oil in to mmbbls of oil in 
our operating expenses from the south monagas unit decreased by percent due to decreased workover costs and completion of the mile oil pipeline in the fourth quarter of to transport oil from the tucupita field to the central processing unit in the uracoa field 
our revenues decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was due to decreased oil sales revenue in venezuela as a result of decreases in world crude oil prices  partially offset by higher sales quantities 
our sales quantities for the year ended december  from venezuela were mmbbls compared to mmbbls for the year ended december  the increase in sales quantities of  bbls  or percent  was due primarily to production efficiency and reservoir management at uracoa  and enhanced drilling performance for the eight wells drilled in the uracoa field beginning august  as a result of incorporating information from the field simulation study conducted during the first eight months of production increased to  bbls or oil per day by the end of as a result of drilling additional wells during the year 
prices for crude oil averaged per bbl pursuant to terms of an operating service agreement from venezuela compared with per bbl for our operating expenses decreased million  or percent  which included a fuel gas charge of million  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the fuel gas charge related to a dispute regarding a difference between rates we paid and rates claimed by pdvsa for natural gas used as fuel for the period through depletion  depreciation and amortization increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with primarily due to decreased proved reserves 
depletion expense per barrel of oil produced from venezuela during was compared with during as a result of a decrease in proved reserves 
we recognized write downs of capitalized costs of million associated with exploration activities during the year ended december  compared with million associated with exploration activities in california 
general and administrative expenses decreased million from million in to million in  exclusive of million of non recurring costs 
non recurring general and administrative costs are comprised of million in debt exchange cost  million in california lease relinquishment  million relocation costs to houston and million severance and termination payments paid or accrued in taxes other than on income increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to increased venezuelan municipal taxes 
investment income and other decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was due to lower average cash and marketable securities balances 
interest expense decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to the reduction of debt balances  partially offset by a reduction of capitalized interest expense 
net gain on exchange rates increased million  or percent for the year ended december  compared with this was due to changes in the value of the bolivar 
we realized income before income taxes and minority interest of million during the year ended december  compared with million in the negative effective tax rate varies from the us statutory rate of percent primarily because of the reversal of a us tax valuation allowance 
the reversal related to the potential utilization of net operating loss carry forwards 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that these us deferred tax assets will be realized in the income attributable to the minority interest decreased million for the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to the decreased profitability oil prices of benton vinccler 
equity in net earnings of affiliated companies increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to the increased income from geoilbent 
our share of revenues from geoilbent was million for the year ended september  compared with revenues of million for the increase of million  or percent  was due to higher world crude oil prices and higher sales quantities 
prices for geoilbent s crude oil averaged per bbl during the year ended september  compared with per bbl for the year ended september  our share of geoilbent oil sales quantities increased by  bbls  or percent  from  bbls sold during the year ended september  to  bbls sold during the year ended september  capital resources and liquidity the oil and natural gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business with unique operating and financial risks see risk factors 
we require capital principally to service our debt and to fund the following costs o drilling and completion costs of wells and the cost of production  treating and transportation facilities  o geological  geophysical and seismic costs  and o acquisition of interests in oil and gas properties 
the amount of available capital will affect the scope of our operations and the rate of our growth 
our future rate of growth also depends substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to service our debt 
in  benton vinccler instituted a hedging program to establish a crude oil price floor using a wti costless collar for our tucupita development drilling program 
benton vinccler has also hedged a portion of its oil sales by purchasing a wti crude oil put to protect its cash flow 
the put is for  barrels of oil per day for the period of march  through december  due to the pricing structure for our venezuela oil  the put has the economic effect of hedging approximately  bopd 
the put costing per barrel  or approximately million  has a strike price of per barrel 
in february  the venezuelan bolivar was allowed to float against the us dollar 
on february   the venezuelan government imposed currency controls and created the commission for administration of foreign currency cadivi with the task of establishing the detailed rules and regulations and generally administering the exchange control regime 
the currency controls fix the exchange rate between the bolivar and the us dollar  and restricts the ability to exchange bolivars for dollars and vice versa 
oil companies  such as benton vinccler are allowed to receive payments for oil sales in us currency and pay dollar denominated expenses from those payments 
we are unable to predict the full impact of the currency controls on us or benton vinccler as the cadivi has not issued final regulations 
the near term effect has been to restrict benton vinccler s ability to make payments to employees and vendors in bolivars  causing it to borrow money on a short term basis to meet these obligations 
all of these short term borrowings have been repaid and while we now have bolivars to meet our current obligations  the situation could change 
in addition  the currency controls have increased the cost of benton vinccler s bolivar denominated debt 
benton vinccler has provided the thirty day notice of its intention to repay its bolivar denominated debt 
the full amount will be repaid on march  as of february   we have cash reserves of approximately million and do not expect the currency conversion restriction to adversely affect our ability to meet our short term loan obligations 
our ability to pay interest on our debt and general corporate overhead is dependent upon the ability of benton vinccler to make loan repayments  dividends and other cash payments to us 
however  there have been  and may again be  unforeseeable interruptions in oil and gas sales or there may be contractual obligations or legal impediments such as the recently instituted currency controls to receiving dividends or distributions from benton vinccler  which could prohibit benton vinccler from remitting funds to us 
management does not believe that the currency controls will prohibit our ability to receive funds from benton vinccler  although were it to do so  our ability to meet our cash requirements would be adversely affected 
debt reduction 
we currently have a significant debt principal obligation payable in million 
we intend to continue to evaluate open market debt purchases of the obligations due in to further reduce debt 
in benton vinccler borrowed million from a venezuelan commercial bank for the construction of a tucupita to uracoa oil pipeline 
benton vinccler has provided the thirty day notice of its intention to repay its bolivar denominated debt 
the full amount will be repaid on march  as of february   we have cash reserves of approximately million and do not expect the currency conversion restriction to adversely affect our ability to meet our short term loan obligations 
working capital 
our capital resources and liquidity are affected by the timing of our semiannual interest payments of approximately million each may and november on the percent senior notes due in november and by receipt of the quarterly payments from pdvsa at the end of the months of february  may  august and november pursuant to the terms of the contract between benton vinccler and pdvsa regarding the south monagas unit 
as a consequence of the timing of these interest payment outflows and the pdvsa payment inflows  our cash balances can increase and decrease dramatically on a few dates during the year 
in each may and november in particular  interest payments at the beginning of the month and pdvsa payments at the end of the month create large swings in our cash balances 
at december   we had million of cash or cash equivalents 
benton vinccler s oil and gas pipeline project loans allow the lender to accelerate repayment if production ceases for a period greater than thirty days 
during the production shut in which started in december  benton vinccler was granted a waiver of this provision until february  for a prepayment of the next two principal obligations aggregating million 
this prepayment  while using cash reserves  reduces our net interest expense as the current interest expense was more than the current interest income earned on the invested funds 
on february   benton vinccler commenced production  thereby eliminating the need for an additional waiver 
a future disruption of production could trigger the debt acceleration provision again 
while no assurances can be given  we believe benton vinccler would be able to obtain another waiver 
the net funds raised and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities 
   net cash provided by used in financing activities 
   net increase decrease in cash    at december   we had current assets of million and current liabilities of million  resulting in working capital of million and a current ratio of this compares with a negative working capital of million and a negative current ratio at december  the increase in working capital of million was primarily due to higher oil prices and the arctic gas sale 
cash flow from operating activities 
during the years ended december  and  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million and million  respectively 
the million increase was primarily due to higher oil revenues and lower operating expenses 
cash flow from investing activities 
during the year ended december  and  we had drilling and production related capital expenditures of approximately million and million  respectively 
of the expenditures  million was attributable to the development of the south monagas unit and million was attributable to lakeside exploration prospect 
the timing and size of capital expenditures for the south monagas unit are entirely at our discretion 
we anticipate that geoilbent will continue to fund its expenditures through its own cash flow and credit facilities 
our remaining capital commitments worldwide are relatively minimal and are substantially at our discretion 
we will also be required to make annual interest payments of approximately million on the notes 
we continue to assess production levels and commodity prices in conjunction with our capital resources and liquidity requirements 
benton vinccler entered into a commodity contract costless collar in and  as described above  a wti crude oil put for a portion of cash flow from financing activities 
in november  we issued million in percent senior unsecured notes due november   of which we subsequently repurchased million at their par value for cash 
interest on these notes is due may st and november st of each year 
the indenture agreements provide for certain limitations on liens  additional indebtedness  certain investment and capital expenditures  dividends  mergers and sales of assets 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of the indenture 
we have an approximately  lease obligation per month for our houston office space 
this lease is valid through august the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  payments in thousands due by period less than after contractual obligation total year years years years long term debt      building lease total      while we can give no assurance  we currently believe that our cash flow from operations coupled with our cash and marketable securities on hand will provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to fund our planned capital expenditures  investments in and advances to affiliates  and semiannual interest payment obligations for the next months 
our expectation is based upon our current estimate of projected prices  the purchase of a wti crude oil put discussed above and production levels  and our assumptions that there will be no further disruptions to our production and that pdvsa will timely pay our invoices 
actual results could be materially affected if there is a significant change in our expectations or assumptions 
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including  but not limited to  the level of production and prices  as well as various economic and political conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business 
additionally  prices for oil are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  market uncertainty and a variety of factors beyond our control 
we currently have a significant debt obligation of million payable in november our ability to meet our debt obligation and to reduce our level of debt depends on the successful implementation of our strategic objectives 
effects of changing prices  foreign exchange rates and inflation our results of operations and cash flow are affected by changing oil prices 
fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices may affect our total planned development activities and capital expenditure program 
there are presently no restrictions in russia that restrict converting us dollars into local currency or local currency into us dollars for routine business operations  such as the payments of invoices  and debt obligations within the russian federation 
as noted above under capital resources and liquidity  venezuela imposed currency exchange restrictions on february  we are unable to predict the impact of the currency controls on us or benton vinccler as the government has not issued final regulations 
within the united states  inflation has had a minimal effect on us  but it is potentially an important factor in results of operations in venezuela and russia 
with respect to benton vinccler and geoilbent  a significant majority of the sources of funds  including the proceeds from oil sales  our contributions and credit financings  are denominated in us dollars  while local transactions in russia and venezuela are conducted in local currency 
if the rate of increase in the value of the dollar compared with the bolivar continues to be less than the rate of inflation in venezuela  then inflation could be expected to have an adverse effect on benton vinccler 
during the year ended december   our net foreign exchange gain attributable to our international operations was million 
however  there are many factors affecting foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our control 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan and russian currencies to the us dollar 
it is not possible for us to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates and exchange controls 
critical accounting policies principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
the equity method of accounting is used for companies and other investments in which we have significant influence 
all intercompany profits  transactions and balances have been eliminated 
we account for our investment in geoilbent and arctic gas based on a fiscal year ending september oil and natural gas revenue is accrued monthly based on sales 
each quarter  benton vinccler invoices pdvsa based on barrels of oil accepted by pdvsa during the quarter  using quarterly adjusted us dollar contract service fees per barrel 
property and equipment we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties with costs accumulated in cost centers on a country by country basis 
all costs associated with the acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized as incurred  including exploration overhead 
only overhead that is directly identified with acquisition  exploration or development activities is capitalized 
all costs related to production  general corporate overhead and similar activities are expensed as incurred 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we regularly evaluate our unproved properties on a country by country basis for possible impairment 
if we abandon all exploration efforts in a country where no proved reserves are assigned  all exploration and acquisition costs associated with the country are expensed 
due to the unpredictable nature of exploration drilling activities  the amount and timing of impairment expenses are difficult to predict with any certainty 
the full cost method of accounting uses proved reserves in the calculation of depletion  depreciation and amortization 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are those which are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved reserves cannot be measured exactly  and the estimation of reserves involves judgmental determinations 
reserve estimates must be reviewed and adjusted periodically to reflect additional information gained from reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data and economic changes 
the estimates are based on current technology and economic conditions  and we consider such estimates to be reasonable and consistent with current knowledge of the characteristics and extent of production 
the estimates include only those amounts considered to be proved reserves and do not include additional amounts which may result from new discoveries in the future  or from application of secondary and tertiary recovery processes where facilities are not in place or for which transportation and or marketing contracts are not in place 
changes in previous estimates of proved reserves result from new information obtained from production history and changes in economic factors 
a large portion of our proved reserves base from consolidated operations is comprised of oil and gas properties that are sensitive to oil price volatility 
we are susceptible to significant upward and downward revisions to our proved reserve volumes and values as a result of changes in year end oil and gas prices and the corresponding adjustment to the projected economic life of such properties 
prices for oil and gas are likely to continue to be volatile  resulting in future revision to our proved reserve base 
we perform a quarterly cost center ceiling test of our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission 
these rules generally require that we price our future oil and gas production at the oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write down if our capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  even if prices declined for only a short period of time 
we have had no write downs due to these ceiling test limitations since given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is likely that our estimate of discounted future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly in the future  even if only for a short period of time  write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur 
write downs required by these rules do not directly impact our cash flows from operating activities 
income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects  calculated at currently enacted rates  of a future deductible taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the financial statements or income tax returns  and b operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
foreign currency we have significant operations outside of the united states  principally in venezuela and an equity investment in russia 
amounts denominated in non us currencies are re measured in united states dollars  and all currency gains or losses are recorded in the statement of income 
we attempt to manage our operations in a manner to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange losses 
however  there are many factors that affect foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our influence 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan and russian currencies to the united states dollar 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
subsequently  the asset retirement cost should be allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after september  we will adopt sfas no 
effective january   and such adoption will not materially impact the financial statements since our pdvsa operating service agreement provides that all wells revert to pdvsa at contract expiration and intervening abandonment obligations are minor 
further we believe the adoption of sfas no 
by geoilbent will not materially impact our equity in earnings given that the fair value of such obligations are not material as of september  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas rescinds the automatic treatment of gains or losses from extinguishment of debt as extraordinary items as outlined in apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations  reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
as allowed under the provisions of sfas  we had decided to adopt sfas early 
accordingly  all gains on early extinguishment of debt have been reclassified to other non operating income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas replaces emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the provisions of this statement shall be effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company will account for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 

the standard amends sfas statement no 
that provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company intends to adopt the prospective method which will apply the recognition provisions to all employee awards granted  modified  or settled in the weighted average fair value of the stock options granted from our stock option plans during  and was  and  respectively 
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used expected life years years years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield we accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and related interpretations  under which no compensation cost has been recognized for stock option awards 
had compensation cost for the plans been determined consistent with sfas  our pro forma net income and earnings per share for  and would have been as follows in thousands  except per share data net income as reported    add stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net income due to acceleration of vesting of former employees deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all grants awarded since january     net income    net income per common share basic diluted in november fasb interpretation  or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantee of indebtedness of others was issued 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
fin s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the guarantor s previous accounting for guarantees that were issued before the date of fin s initial application may not be revised or restated to reflect the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods that end after december  as of december   the company does not have any guarantor obligations 
in january fasb interpretation  or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities was issued 
fin identifies certain off balance sheet arrangements that meet the definition of a variable interest entity vie 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the party that is exposed to the majority of the risks and or returns of the vie 
in future accounting periods  the primary beneficiary will be required to consolidate the vie 
in addition  more extensive disclosure requirements apply to the primary beneficiary  as well as other significant investors 
we do not believe we participate in any arrangement that would be subject to the provisions of fin in november  the international practices task force concluded that russia has ceased being a highly inflationary economy as of january  as a result of the task force conclusion  companies reporting under us gaap in russia will be required to apply the guidance contained in emerging issues task force eitf no 
and eitf no 
as of january  we have not yet estimated the effect that eitf no 
and eitf no 
will have on geoilbent or our equity position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices  interest rates  foreign exchange and political risk  as discussed below 
oil prices as an independent oil producer  our revenue  other income and equity earnings and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
historically  prices received for oil production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
through february   we utilized a costless collar hedge transaction with respect to a portion of our oil production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  establish an acceptable rate of return on our tucupita drilling program  as well as to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations 
benton vinccler has hedged a portion of its oil production by purchasing a wti crude oil put to protect its cash flow 
because gains or losses associated with hedging transactions are included in oil sales when the hedged production is delivered  such gains and losses are generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the commodities 
see note derivatives and hedging for a complete discussion of our derivative activity 
interest rates total long term debt at december  of million consisted of fixed rate senior unsecured notes maturing in million 
benton vinccler has million us dollar denominated and million bolivar denominated variable rate loans 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in the interest rate would not have had a material affect on our results of operations 
foreign exchange for the venezuelan operations  oil and gas sales are received under a contract in effect through in us dollars  expenditures are both in us dollars and local currency 
for geoilbent  a majority of the oil sales are received in rubles  expenditures are both in us dollars and local currency  although a larger percentage of the expenditures are in local currency 
we have utilized no currency hedging programs to mitigate any risks associated with operations in these countries  and therefore our financial results are subject to favorable or unfavorable fluctuations in exchange rates and inflation in these countries 
venezuela has recently imposed currency exchange controls see capital resources and liquidity above 
political risk the stability of government in venezuela and the government s relationship with the state owned national oil company  pdvsa  remain significant risks for our company 
pdvsa is the sole purchaser of all venezuelan oil and gas production 
in april there was a failed attempt to remove the president of venezuela 
during this period  sales were curtailed but our oil production was not interrupted  but it did delay the importation of critical equipment  which contributed to the slowdown in our drilling operations 
from december  through february   no sales were made because of pdvsa s inability to accept our oil due to the national civil work stoppage 
as a result  sales were reduced by approximately  barrels and sales in were reduced by an estimated million barrels 
while the situation has stabilized and production is returning to normal  there continues to be political and economic uncertainty that could lead to another disruption of our sales 
as a result of the national civil work stoppage  the government of venezuela terminated several thousand pdvsa employees and announced a decentralization of pdvsa s operations 
while the effect of these changes cannot be predicted  it could adversely affect pdvsa s ability to manage its contracts and meet its obligations with its suppliers and vendors  such as benton vinccler 
as a result of the situation in pdvsa  its payment to benton vinccler for crude delivered in the fourth quarter was late by seven days 
we believe that the payment demonstrates pdvsa s commitment to building its production levels back to full capacity and returning to more normalized business relations with its customers and suppliers 
while we have substantial cash reserves to withstand a future disruption  a prolonged loss of sales or a failure or delay by pdvsa to pay our invoices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
