item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the men s wearhouse opened its first store in houston  texas in august the company combined with moores retail group inc moores in february and with k g men s center  inc k g in june  with both combinations accounted for as a pooling of interests see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at february   we operated stores in the united states and stores in canada 
we opened stores in  stores in and stores in  in addition  we acquired one store in expansion is generally continued within a market as long as management believes it will provide profitable incremental sales volume 
historically  this growth has resulted in significant increases in net sales and has also contributed to increased net earnings 
however  in  we experienced a decrease in net sales and net earnings primarily as a result of the declining us economy and the effects of the events of september  the continued decline of the us and canadian economies throughout fiscal year continued to impact net sales and net earnings in comparison to pre levels see results of operations discussion herein 
like most retailers  our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  more than of our net sales and more than of our net earnings have been generated during the fourth quarter of each year 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year 
we intend to continue our expansion in new and existing markets 
we plan to open approximately new men s wearhouse stores and seven new k g stores in  to close two men s wearhouse stores and six k g stores and to expand and or relocate approximately existing men s wearhouse stores and four existing k g stores 
the average cost excluding telecommunications and point of sale equipment and inventory of opening a new store is expected to be approximately million in we have closed stores in the three years ended february  generally  in determining whether to close a store  we consider the store s historical and projected performance and the continued desirability of the store s location 
in determining store contribution  the company considers net sales  cost of sales and other direct store costs  but excludes buying costs  corporate overhead  depreciation and amortization  financing costs and advertising 
store performance is continually monitored and  occasionally  as regions and shopping areas change  management may determine that it is in our best interest to close or relocate a store 
in  three stores were closed due to substandard performance 
in  three stores were closed due to substandard performance or lease expiration 
in  five stores were closed due to substandard performance or lease expiration and two stores were closed when their operations were combined with other existing area stores 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the appropriate application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in many instances  this also requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts and disclosures included in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  since future events and conditions and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results will differ from our estimates  and such differences could be material to our financial statements 
our accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consistently apply these policies and periodically evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates in light of actual events 
historically  we have found our accounting policies to be appropriate and our estimates and assumptions reasonable 
we believe our critical accounting policies and our most significant estimates are those that relate to inventories and long lived assets  including goodwill  and our estimated liabilities for the self insured portions of our workers compensation and employee health benefit costs 
our inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method for approximately of our inventory and on the retail inventory method for the remaining 
our inventory cost also includes estimated procurement and distribution costs warehousing  freight  hangers and merchandising costs associated with the inventory  with the balance of such costs included in cost of sales 
we make assumptions  based primarily on historical experience  as to items in our inventory that may be damaged  obsolete or salable only at marked down prices and reduce the cost of inventory to reflect the market value of these items 
if actual damages  obsolescence or market demand is significantly different from our estimates  additional inventory write downs could be required 
in addition  procurement and distribution costs are allocated to inventory based on the ratio of annual product purchases to average inventory cost 
if this ratio were to change significantly  it could materially affect the amount of procurement and distribution costs included in cost of sales 
we make judgments about the carrying value of long lived assets  such as property and equipment and amortizable intangibles  and the recoverability of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
we test for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances dictate 
to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  including goodwill  we make various assumptions about the future prospects for the brand that the asset relates to and typically estimate future cash flows to be generated by these brands 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
we recorded no impairment charge as a result of our testing performed during we self insure portions of our workers compensation and employee medical costs 
we estimate our liability for future payments under these programs based on historical experience and various assumptions as to participating employees  health care costs  number of claims and other factors  including industry trends and information provided to us by our insurance broker 
we also use actuarial estimates with respect to workers compensation 
if the number of claims or the costs associated with those claims were to increase significantly over our estimates  additional charges to earnings could be necessary to cover required payments

sales of men s apparel is particularly affected since buying patterns for men are considered to be more discretionary than those in other apparel areas 
gross margin increased million  or  to million in as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased from in to in this decrease in gross margin percentage predominately resulted from an increase in occupancy cost which is relatively constant on a per store basis as a percentage of sales and higher markdowns at the men s wearhouse brand associated with a shift to merchandise with lower opening price points

the decrease in advertising was due to planned reductions in media spending 
the increase in store salaries was the result of higher sales commission rates in for promotional and other merchandise sales categories 
these commission rates were put in place to help drive the shift to lower opening price points for merchandise offerings at the men s wearhouse brand

the decrease in the weighted average borrowings resulted primarily from decreased short term borrowings under our credit facilities

our effective income tax rate for the year ended february  was compared to for the prior year

sales of men s tailored apparel are particularly affected since buying patterns for men are considered to be more discretionary than those in other apparel areas 
the negative effect of the terrorist events of september  on retail and numerous other business sectors also contributed to the decline 
gross margin decreased million  or  to million in as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased from in to in this decrease in gross margin predominately resulted from an increase in occupancy cost which is relatively constant on a per store basis as a percentage of sales and a larger percentage of the sales mix being contributed by our lower margin k g brand

these factors resulted in net earnings of million or of net sales  compared with net earnings of million or of net sales 
liquidity and capital resources in january  we replaced our existing million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature in february with a new revolving credit agreement with a group of banks the credit agreement that provides for borrowing of up to million through february  advances under the new credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  the agent s prime rate or the reserve adjusted libor rate plus a varying interest rate margin 
the credit agreement also provides for fees applicable to unused commitments 
the terms and conditions of the new credit agreement are substantially the same as those of the replaced facility 
as of february  and february   there was no indebtedness outstanding under the respective credit facilities 
the new credit agreement contains various restrictive and financial covenants  including the requirement to maintain a minimum level of net worth and certain financial ratios 
the credit agreement also prohibits payment of cash dividends on our common stock 
we are in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement 
in addition  in january  we entered into a new canadian credit facility which is a term credit agreement under which we borrowed can million us million 
the term credit borrowing is payable in quarterly installments of can million us million beginning may  with the remaining unpaid principal payable on february  borrowings under the new term credit agreement were used to repay approximately can million us million in outstanding indebtedness of moores under the previous term credit agreement and to fund financing requirements of moores 
the effective interest rate for the term credit borrowing was and at february  and february   respectively 
covenants and interest rates for the term credit agreement are substantially similar to those contained in our new credit agreement 
as of february  and february   there was us million and us million outstanding under these term credit agreements  respectively 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit agreement 
we had working capital of million  million and million at the end of  and  respectively 
historically  our working capital has been at its lowest level in january and february  and has increased through november as inventory buildup is financed with both vendor payables and credit facility borrowings in preparation for the fourth quarter selling season 
our operating activities provided net cash of million and million in and  respectively  as cash provided by net earnings  adjusted for non cash charges and increases in payables  was more than offset by increases in inventories and other assets and  in  a decrease in income taxes payable 
inventories increased million in and million in due to seasonal inventory buildup  the addition of inventory for new stores and stores expected to be opened in the following quarter and the purchase of fabric used in the direct sourcing of inventory 
other assets increased primarily due to increased investment in tuxedo rental merchandise  while income taxes payable decreased in mainly due to reduced earnings 
during  our operating activities provided net cash of million due mainly to net earnings  adjusted for non cash charges  a decrease in inventories and an increase in payables  offset partially by an increase in other assets and a decrease in income taxes payable 
our decrease in net sales in fiscal  combined with our inventory levels at the end of fiscal and our modest increase in net sales in fiscal  have resulted in lower planned inventory purchases 
we also modified our inventory mix at our men s wearhouse stores to increase our offering of opening price point product 
as a result  the inventory buildup through fiscal was not as significant as that typically experienced during prior years and our balance of inventory at year end was less than our fiscal year end balance 
our payables  however  increased as our buying patterns normalized in the last quarter of other assets increased primarily due to increased investment in tuxedo rental merchandise  while income taxes payable decreased mainly due to reduced earnings and a lower effective tax rate associated with the mix of federal and state earnings 
our investing activities used net cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively  due mainly to capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures relate to costs incurred for stores opened  remodeled or relocated during the year or under construction at the end of the year and infrastructure technology investments 
however  during  cash used for capital expenditures was partially offset by net proceeds received from the sale of substantially all of the assets of chelsea market systems  llc chelsea to an unrelated company regularly engaged in the development and licensing of software to the retail industry 
as a result of the sale of chelsea  and after giving effect to the settlement of a related lawsuit  the company received net proceeds of million 
approximately million of this amount will be recognized as a pretax operating gain by the company  pending the lapse of certain indemnification provisions related to the assets sold  in the first quarter of see other matters herein 
the following table details our capital expenditures in millions new store construction relocation and remodeling of existing stores information technology distribution facilities other total property additions relating to new stores include stores in various stages of completion at the end of the fiscal year two stores at the end of  three stores at the end of and no stores at the end of 
our expenditures for the relocation and remodeling of existing stores continue to be substantial as we have opened fewer new stores 
we used net cash in financing activities of million in  million in and million in mainly for net payments of long term debt and purchases of treasury stock 
as previously noted  we entered into a new canadian credit facility which is a term credit agreement under which we borrowed can million us million in january borrowings under the term credit agreement were used to repay approximately can million us million in outstanding indebtedness of moores under the previous term credit agreement 
in january  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares in the open market or in private transactions  dependent on the market price and other considerations 
on january   the board of directors authorized an expansion of the stock repurchase program for up to an additional two million shares of our common stock 
during  and  we repurchased   and  shares of our common stock under this program at a cost of million  million and million  respectively 
in november  the board of directors authorized a new program for the repurchase of up to million of company stock in the open market or in private transactions 
as of february   no shares had yet been repurchased under this program 
in connection with our share repurchase programs  we have from time to time issued put option contracts and received premiums for doing so  with the premiums being added to our capital in excess of par and effectively reducing the cost of our share repurchases 
under these contracts  the contract counterparties have the option to require us to purchase a specific number of shares of our common stock at specific strike prices per share on specific dates 
during  we issued three separate contracts for a total of  shares and received premiums of million 
however  the contracts expired unexercised and all of the  shares we repurchased for million in were acquired in open market transactions 
during  we repurchased  shares of our stock for million in the open market and  shares for million through settlement of an option contract 
we received a premium of million for issuing this contract 
the contract counterparty had the option to exercise this contract at a strike price of per share on december   but contract completion was required earlier if the market price of our common stock fell below a trigger price of per share 
during the third quarter of  the market price of our common stock fell below the trigger price and we settled the contract 
our primary cash requirements are to finance working capital increases as well as to fund capital expenditure requirements which are anticipated to be approximately million for this amount includes the anticipated costs of opening approximately new men s wearhouse stores and seven new k g stores in at an expected average cost per store of approximately million excluding telecommunications and point of sale equipment and inventory 
it also includes approximately million for expansion of our tuxedo distribution facility and additional material handling equipment 
the balance of the capital expenditures for will be used for telecommunications  point of sale and other computer equipment and systems  store relocations  remodeling and expansion and infrastructure expansion to support our tuxedo rental business 
the company anticipates that each of the new men s wearhouse stores and each of the seven new k g stores will require  on average  an initial inventory costing approximately million and million  respectively subject to the same seasonal patterns affecting inventory at all stores  which will be funded by our revolving credit facility  trade credit and cash from operations 
the actual amount of future capital expenditures and inventory purchases will depend in part on the number of new stores opened and the terms on which new stores are leased 
additionally  the continuing consolidation of the men s tailored clothing industry and recent financial difficulties of significant menswear retailers may present us with opportunities to acquire retail chains significantly larger than our past acquisitions 
any such acquisitions may be undertaken as an alternative to opening new stores 
we may use cash on hand  together with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of equity securities  to take advantage of significant acquisition opportunities 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our various credit agreements  will be sufficient to fund planned store openings  other capital expenditures and operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
in connection with our direct sourcing program  we may enter into purchase commitments that are denominated in a foreign currency primarily the euro 
we generally enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations related to such commitments 
as these forward exchange contracts are with two financial institutions  we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by these parties 
however  due to the creditworthiness of these major financial institutions  full performance is anticipated 
we may also be exposed to market risk as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates 
this market risk should be substantially offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying transactions 
other matters in january  we formed a joint venture company chelsea for the purpose of developing a new point of sale software system for the company and after successful implementation  exploring the possibility of marketing the system to third parties 
under the terms of the agreement forming chelsea  we owned of chelsea and a director and officer owned with the understanding that the officer would assign  either directly or indirectly  some of his interest in chelsea to other persons involved in the project 
the point of sale system was developed and successfully deployed by the company during and from january though march  we funded and recognized as expense all of the operating costs of chelsea  which aggregated million 
on march   chelsea sold substantially all of its assets to an unrelated company regularly engaged in the development and licensing of software to the retail industry 
as a result of the sale by chelsea  and after giving effect to the settlement of the lawsuit  the company received a net amount of million 
approximately million of this amount will be recognized as a pretax operating gain by the company  pending the lapse of certain indemnification provisions related to the assets sold  in the first quarter of impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to exposure from fluctuations in us dollar euro exchange rates 
as further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial information and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to limit exposure to changes in currency exchange rates

unrealized pretax losses on these forward contracts totaled approximately million at february  unrealized pretax gains on these forward contracts totaled approximately million at february  a hypothetical change in applicable february  forward rates would increase or decrease this pretax loss by approximately million related to these positions 
however  it should be noted that any change in the value of these contracts  whether real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
moores conducts its business in canadian dollars 
the exchange rate between canadian dollars and us dollars has fluctuated over the last ten years 
if the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar weakens  then the revenues and earnings of our canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of our canadian net assets in us dollars may decline 
we are also subject to market risk due to our long term floating rate term loan of us million at february  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our cash requirements for interest payments 
for example  an average increase of in the variable interest rate would increase our interest expense and payments by approximately million
