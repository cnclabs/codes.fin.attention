item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception in february  genta has devoted its principal efforts toward drug discovery and research and development 
genta has been unprofitable to date and expects to incur substantial operating losses due to continued requirements for ongoing and planned research and development activities  pre clinical and clinical testing  manufacturing activities  regulatory activities  and establishment of a sales and marketing organization 
from its inception to december   the company has incurred a cumulative net loss of million 
the company has experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and it expects that these fluctuations in revenues  expenses and losses will continue 
genta s strategy is to build a product and technology portfolio primarily focused on its oncology products 
in this regard  effective march  the company significantly reduced its involvement with respect to genta jago  its owned r d joint venture 
the company also sold substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the company s wholly owned specialty chemicals subsidiary jbl scientific  inc jbl for cash  a promissory note and certain pharmaceutical development services in support of genta s genasense tm development project in may in october  the company relocated its entire operation to berkeley heights  new jersey 
results of operations genta has focused its resources on the development of its lead antisense oligonucleotide  genasense tm 
the following discussion of results of operations relates to the company s continuing operations summary operating results for the years ended december  thousands increase increase decrease decrease revenues license fees   royalties costs and expenses research and development      general and administrative      promega settlement    equity related compensation     loss from operations      equity in net income of joint venture other income      income taxes net loss      operating revenues consisting of license fees and royalties were million in compared to million in and million in these revenues were derived mainly from the initial million licensing fee and million development funding received from aventis under the collaborative agreement note  along with non exclusive sub license agreements involving antisense technology 
these initial payments received from aventis will be recognized over the estimated useful life of the related first to expire patent of months 
the non exclusive sub license agreements were initiated with atugen ag and epigenesis pharmaceuticals  inc in  and sequitur incorporated and oasis biopharmaceuticals  inc in costs and expenses totaled million in  net of aventis reimbursement of million  compared to million in and million in these increases reflect additional clinical trial activity and related drug supply and salaries 
services and capabilities that have not been retained within the company are out sourced through short term contracts or from consultants 
substantially  all pre clinical biology and clinical trial work are now conducted through such collaborations with external scientists and clinicians 
the company anticipates that  if sufficient collaborative revenues and other funding are available  research and development expenses may increase in future years due to requirements for pre clinical studies  clinical trials and increased regulatory costs 
the company will continue to assess the potential cost benefit ratio of developing its own antisense oligonucleotide manufacturing  and marketing and sales activities if and as such products are successfully developed and approved for marketing 
research and development expenses totaled million in  net of aventis reimbursement of million  compared to million in and million in the increase from through is due primarily to drug supply costs and investigator and monitor fees related to expanded clinical trials 
it is anticipated that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future  as genta expands its other product development programs 
furthermore  the company is also pursuing other opportunities for new product development candidates  which  if successful  will require additional research and development expenses 
in an effort to focus its research and development on areas that provide the most significant commercial opportunities  the company continually evaluates its ongoing programs in light of the latest market information and conditions  availability of third party funding  technological advances  and other factors 
as a result of such evaluation  the company s product development plans have changed from time to time  and the company anticipates that they will continue to do so in the future 
general and administrative expenses were million in  net of aventis reimbursement of million  compared to million in and million in the increase is primarily related to financial advisory services  royalty payments and legal fees relating to the collaborative agreement note  personnel costs and increased marketing related spending 
the company records charges to general and administrative expense for the carrying value of abandoned patents no longer related to the research and development efforts of the company 
there were no abandoned patent charges in and the amounts recorded in and were immaterial 
the company recorded charges to non cash equity related compensation of million in compared to million in and million in this decrease in was primarily due to the acceleration of outstanding stock options for the four members of the company s board of directors who resigned in march note 
equity in earnings of joint venture genta jago was million in compared to none in and in since the first quarter of  there have been only million in net earnings of the joint venture allocated to genta and we are currently seeking to terminate our involvement with the joint venture 
net other income  principally interest income decreased over the comparable periods in and  as a result of significantly lower investment balances and decreased yields on investments 
the proceeds received from aventis were not placed into any investment instruments until october interest expense is attributable to interest being accrued on the million convertible promissory note issued to aventis note 
interest income has fluctuated significantly each year and is anticipated to continue to fluctuate primarily due to changes in the levels of cash  investments and interest rates during each period 
the company recorded no gain on the sale of marketable securities in compared to approximately million in and to million in  which reflects a non recurring gain on the disposition of securities in september genta exercised  warrants to purchase shares of common stock of cv therapeutics  inc cv 
these warrants  which were restricted and not publicly traded  were issued to genta by cv in connection with a licensing arrangement entered into in the company received approximately million in cash upon the sale of such common shares 
recent accounting pronouncements the company has adopted all required statements of financial accounting standards issued subsequent to december   as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
adoption of these standards did not or is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
these estimates are most significant in connection with our critical accounting policies  namely those of our accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to o revenue recognition 
the company s policy is to recognize revenues under license arrangements when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
royalties are recognized when earned 
consistent with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab  initial funding of ongoing development received from aventis after the achievement of certain research and development milestones note will be recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the related first to expire patent of months 
any subsequent milestone payments that may be received from aventis will also be recognized over the then  remaining estimated useful life of the related first to expire patent 
o research and development costs 
all such costs are expensed as incurred  including raw material costs required to manufacture drugs for clinical trials 
once genta has submitted an nda  which includes the results of the preclinical and clinical testing  chemistry  manufacturing and control information  to the fda for approval to commence commercial sales  genta will then include the sales launch product  consisting of raw materials and all subsequent processing costs required to produce finished goods  as inventory on genta s balance sheet in anticipation of approval by the fda 
reimbursements for applicable genasense tm related costs  under the collaborative agreement note  will continue to be recorded as a reduction to expense 
o intangible assets 
the company s intangible assets consist primarily of licensed technology and capitalized patent costs  and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the company s policy is to evaluate the appropriateness of the carrying values of the unamortized balances of intangible assets on the basis of estimated future cash flows undiscounted and other factors 
if such evaluation were to indicate an impairment of these intangible assets  such impairment would be recognized by a write down of the applicable assets 
the company evaluates the continuing value of patents and patent applications each financial reporting period 
as a result of this evaluation  the company may elect to continue to maintain  seek to out license  or abandon these patents liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has financed its operations primarily from private placements and public offerings of its equity securities 
cash provided from these offerings totaled approximately million through december   including net proceeds of million received in  million received in and million received in the company used million in operating activities during  resulting from a net loss of million  offset by deferred revenues received from aventis  non cash charges and improved working capital aggregating million 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million compared to million at december  in march  the company and aventis negotiated a line of credit for an amount up to million 
management believes that at the current rate of spending  primarily in support of on going and anticipated clinical trials  coupled with the amounts to be reimbursed by aventis and the available line of credit  the company should have sufficient cash funds to maintain its present operations to the end of additional aventis milestone payments and other funding available to the company upon the anticipated nda approval of genasense tm should provide sufficient capital resources for beyond if the company successfully secures sufficient levels of collaborative revenues and other sources of financing  it expects to use such financing to continue to expand its ongoing research and development activities  preclinical testing and clinical trials  costs associated with the market introduction of potential products  and expansion of its administrative activities 
the company anticipates that significant additional sources of financing  primarily expense reimbursement from aventis  will be required in order for the company to continue its planned operations 
the company also anticipates seeking additional product development opportunities from external sources 
such acquisitions may consume cash reserves or require additional cash or equity 
the company s working capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including i the progress of the company s research and development programs  ii the timing and results of pre clinical testing and clinical trials  iii the level of resources that the company devotes to sales and marketing capabilities  iv technological advances  v the activities of competitors  and vi the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others to fund certain research and development efforts  to conduct clinical trials  to obtain regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  to manufacture and market products 
future minimum obligations at december  are as follows thousands drug purchase convertible operating leases commitments debt thereafter   total    the drug purchase commitments are the maximum per the terms of the supply agreement note 
the supply agreement provides for mechanisms to mitigate costs should requirements be lower than anticipated and various performance criteria  which could lower the and commitments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s carrying values of cash  marketable securities  accounts payable and accrued expenses are a reasonable approximation of their fair value 
the estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by the company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies note 
however  considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates utilized in the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange 
the company has not entered into  and does not expect to enter into  financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes 
the company does not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swaps and or similar instruments 
since the company has liquidated its genta europe subsidiary  the company has no material currency exchange or interest rate risk exposure as of december  with the liquidation  there will be no ongoing exposure to material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operation for sensitivity to changes in interest rates or to changes in currency exchange rates
