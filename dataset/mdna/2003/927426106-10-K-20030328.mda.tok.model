the company is prohibited by the bhca  except in certain statutorily prescribed instances  from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the outstanding voting share of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiaries 
however  the company  subject to the prior approval of the federal reserve board  may engage in any  or acquire shares of companies engaged in  activities that are deemed by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
under federal reserve board regulations  a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner 
in addition  it is the federal reserve boards policy that in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks  a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks 
a bank holding company s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the federal reserve board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the federal reserve board s regulations or both

see item business supervision and regulation sarbanes oxley act of the bank the bank  as a california chartered bank  is subject to primary supervision  periodic examination  and regulation by the dfi and the fdic 
to a lesser extent  the bank is also subject to certain regulations promulgated by the federal reserve board 
if  as a result of an examination of the bank  the fdic should determine that the financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity  or other aspects of the bank s operations are unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation  various remedies are available to the fdic 
such remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices  to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced  to direct an increase in capital  to restrict the growth of the bank  to assess civil monetary penalties  to remove officers and directors and ultimately to terminate the bank s deposit insurance  which for a california chartered bank would result in a revocation of the bank s charter 
the dfi has many of the same remedial powers 
various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the state of california and the united states affect the operations of the bank 
state and federal statues and regulations relate to many aspects of the bank s operations  including reserves against deposits  ownership of deposit accounts  interest rates payable on deposits  loans  investments  mergers and acquisitions  borrowings  dividends  locations of branch offices  and capital requirements

dividends and other transfer of funds dividends from the bank constitute the principal source of income to the company 
the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank

under california law  shareholders of the company may receive dividends when and as declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available for such purpose 
with 
table of contents certain exceptions  a california corporation may not pay a dividend to its shareholders unless i its retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed dividend  or ii after giving effect to the dividend  the corporation s assets would equal at least times its liabilities and  for corporations with classified balance sheets  the current assets of the corporation would be at least equal to its current liabilities or  if the average of the earnings of the corporation before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of the interest expense of the corporation for those fiscal years  at least equal to times its current liabilities 
the fdic and the dfi also have authority to prohibit the bank from engaging in activities that  in their opinion  constitute unsafe or unsound practices in conducting its business 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition of the bank in question and other factors  that the fdic and the dfi could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments might  under some circumstances  be an unsafe or unsound practice 
further  the fdic and the frb have established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by banks or bank holding companies under their jurisdiction 
compliance with the standards set forth in such guidelines and the restrictions that are or may be imposed under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law could limit the amount of dividends which the bank or the company may pay 
an insured depository institution is prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or  with certain limited exceptions  making capital distributions if after such transaction the institution would be undercapitalized 
the dfi may impose similar limitations on the bank 
see item 
business supervision and regulation prompt corrective action 
the bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of credit to  or the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit on behalf of  the company or other affiliates  the purchase of  or investments in  stock or other securities thereof  the taking of such securities as collateral for loans  and the purchase of assets of the company or other affiliates 
such restrictions prevent the company and other affiliates from borrowing from the bank unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations of designated amounts 
further  such secured loans and investments by the bank to or in the company or to or in any other affiliates are limited  individually  to of the bank s capital and surplus as defined by federal regulations  and such secured loans and investments are limited  in the aggregate  to of the bank s capital and surplus as defined by federal regulations 
california law also imposes certain restriction with respect to transactions involving the company and other controlling persons of the bank 
additional restrictions on transaction with affiliates may be imposed on the bank under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law 
see item 
business supervision and regulation prompt corrective action 
capital requirements the federal reserve board and the fdic have established risk based minimum capital guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by united states banking organizations 
these guidelines are intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us treasury securities  to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as commercial loans 
the federal banking agencies require a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk adjusted assets of 
in addition to the risked based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total assets must be 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  the regulators have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above minimum guidelines and ratios 

table of contents prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  among other things  identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and requires the respective federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories 
fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations  management and capital distributions  depending on the category in which an institution is classified 
failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements 
an undercapitalized institution must develop a capital restoration plan 
at december  the bank exceeded all of the required ratios for classification as well capitalized 
an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions 
banking agencies have also adopted regulations which mandate that regulators take into consideration i concentrations of credit risk  ii interest rate risk when the interest rate sensitivity of an institution s assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its off balance sheet position  and iii risks from non traditional activities  as well as an institution s ability to manage those risks  when determining the adequacy of an institution s capital 
that evaluation will be made as a part of the institution s regular safety and soundness examination 
in addition  the banking agencies have amended their regulatory capital guidelines to incorporate a measure for market risk 
in accordance with the amended guidelines  the company and any company with significant trading activity must incorporate a measure for market risk in its regulatory capital calculations 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the supervising agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses for violations of law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions vary commensurate with the severity of the violation 
safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
the guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to i internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv asset growth  v earnings  and vi compensation  fees and benefits 
in addition  the federal banking agencies have also adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to asset quality and earnings standards 
these guidelines provide six standards for establishing and maintaining a system to identify problem assets and prevent those assets from deteriorating 
under these standards  any insured depository institution should i conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem assets  ii estimate the inherent losses in problem assets and establish reserves that are sufficient to absorb estimated losses  iii compare problem asset totals to capital  iv take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem assets  v consider the size and potential risks of material asset concentrations  and vi provide periodic asset quality reports with adequate information for management and the board of directors to assess the level of asset risk 
these guidelines also set forth standards for evaluating and monitoring earnings and for ensuring that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves 

table of contents premiums for deposit insurance the company s deposit accounts are insured by the bank insurance fund bif  as administered by the fdic  up to the maximum permitted by law 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operation  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order  or condition imposed by the fdic or the institution s primary regulator 
the fdic charges an annual assessment for the insurance of deposits  which as of december   ranged from to basis points per of insured deposits  based on the risk a particular institution poses to its deposit insurance fund 
the risk classification is based on an institution s capital group and supervisory subgroup assignment 
an institution s risk category is based upon whether the institution is well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or less than adequately capitalized 
each insured depository institution is also assigned to one of the following supervisory subgroups 
subgroup a  b or c 
subgroup a institutions are financially sound institutions with few minor weaknesses  subgroup b institutions are institutions that demonstrate weaknesses which  if not corrected  could result in significant deterioration  and subgroup c institutions are institutions for which there is a substantial probability that the fdic will suffer a loss in connection with the institution unless effective action is taken to correct the areas of weakness 
insured institutions are not allowed to disclose their risk assessment classification and no assurance can be given as to what the future level of premiums will be 
the community reinvestment act cra the bank is subject to certain fair lending requirements and reporting obligations involving lending  investing and other cra activities

financial services modernization legislation in november  the gramm leach bliley act of glb was enacted 
the glb repeals provisions of the glass steagall act which restricted the affiliation of federal reserve member banks with firms engaged principally in specified securities activities  and which restricted officer  director or employee interlocks between a member bank and any company or person primarily engaged in specified securities activities 
in addition  the glb contains provisions that expressly preempt any state law restricting the establishment of financial affiliations  primarily related to insurance 
the general effect of the law is to establish a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks  insurance companies  securities firms and other financial service providers by revising and expanding the bhca framework to permit a holding company to engage in a full range of financial activities through a new entity known as a financial holding company 
financial activities is broadly defined to include not only banking  insurance and securities activities  but also merchant banking and additional activities that the federal reserve board  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  determines to be financial in 
table of contents nature  incidental to such financial activities or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
the glb provides that no company may acquire control of an insured savings association unless that company engages  and continues to engage  only in the financial activities permissible for a financial holding company  unless the company is grandfathered as a unitary savings and loan holding company 
the glb grandfathers any company that was a unitary savings and loan holding company on may  or became a unitary savings and loan holding company pursuant to an application pending on that date 
the glb also permits national banks to engage in expanded activities through the formation of financial subsidiaries 
a national bank may have a subsidiary engaged in any activity authorized for national banks directly or any financial activity  except for insurance underwriting  insurance investments  real estate investment or development  or merchant banking  which may only be conducted through a subsidiary of a financial holding company 
financial activities include all activities permitted under new sections of the bhca or permitted by regulation 
to the extent that the glb permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
the glb is intended to grant to community banks powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis and which unitary savings and loan holding companies already possess 
nevertheless  the glb may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that the company faces from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources than the company has

regulation w generally excludes all non bank and non savings association subsidiaries of banks from treatment as affiliates  except to the extent that the federal reserve board decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates 
under a present exemption from compliance with the quantitative limits and collateral requirements of regulation w and section a  a bank can purchase loans  or other extensions of credit  from an affiliate without being subject to the and limitation for covered transactions as long as the extension of credit is originated by the affiliate  the bank makes an independent evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrower before the affiliate makes or commits to make the extension of credit  the bank commits to purchase the extension of credit before the affiliate makes or commits to make the extension of credit  the bank does not make a blanket advance commitment to purchase extensions of credit from the affiliate  and the dollar amount of the extension of credit  when aggregated with the dollar amount of all other extensions of credit purchased from the affiliate during the preceding calendar months by the bank and its fdic insured depository institution affiliates  does not represent more than of the dollar amount of extensions of credit originated by the affiliate during the preceding calendar months

the company s earnings are derived predominately from net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the net interest margin is the net interest income divided by the average interest earning assets 
net interest income and net interest margin are affected by several factors including the level of  and the relationship between  the dollar amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relationship between repricing or maturity of the company s variable rate and fixed rate loans and securities  and its deposits and borrowings  and the magnitude of the company s non interest earning assets  including non accrual loans and other real estate loans 
beginning in early  the company began to implement an asset liability management strategy that was built around the risk elements of interest rate  asset duration and funding risks 
a component of this strategy was to deploy excess liquidity previously invested in federal funds into higher yielding mortgage backed securities with shorter duration and higher cash flow components 
the company increased the investment portfolio accordingly  which enhanced the company s overall yields and better addressed the risk elements identified above 
in doing so  the company began to realize excessive prepayments on call options on certain of its mortgage backed security investments and liquidated those securities prior to market premium erosion while generating gains on sale of investment securities 
the company s investment securities increased by million from million at december  to million at december  the increase in investment securities in fiscal provided an increase of million in interest income for the year ending december  over the prior period 
interest income from investment securities for the years ending december  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the company decreased its average investment in overnight federal funds by million at december  compared to december  as a result  the interest income from overnight federal funds decreased by million for the year ending december  compared to the year ending december  interest income from overnight federal funds for the years ending december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
net interest income total interest income for the years ended  and was million  million and million  respectively  while total interest expenses was million  million and million  respectively 
therefore  the net interest income was million  million and million for each of the years ended   and  respectively  for a net interest margin of  and  respectively 
although the net interest margin decreased a modest basis points from in to in  the net interest income increased million or from million in to million in as the volume of earning assets increased 
as discussed above  during the year  the prime interest rate decreased by basis points  or  from its level at year end further  in  the prime interest rate decreased by basis points from its level at year end at december   the national prime interest rate was at 
the company experienced some compression in the net interest margin as existing loans paid off and new loans were originated at lower market rates 
however  the volume of loans originated increased dramatically in as compared to therefore contributing to an increase in net interest income of million from volume which was offset by a million decrease as a result of rate changes 
the net increase of million for fiscal is an improvement over the prior period change of million in net interest income 

table of contents though the company is asset sensitive in the short run  its loan portfolio experienced a shift in composition and complexity during  which enabled it to substantially avoid net interest margin compression during the year despite the declining interest rate environment 
a substantial portion of the company s repriceable loan portfolio has reached its floor rates during the year 
these loans did not continue to adjust downward as the market interest rates decreased 
loan fee income  which is included in interest income  also stabilized interest income during a period of declining interest rates 
for the year ending december   loan fee income represented million of the million in loan income  or of total loan related income 
for the year ending december   loan fee income was million of the million in total loan income compared to loan income of million of the million in total income for the year ending december  construction loans and commercial real estate loans generate the bulk of all loan fee income 
the company continues its emphasis in single family coastal construction loans from its manhattan beach loan production office which began in  concentrating on the coastal communities of los angeles 
in late  the company began a new product line of single family tract home construction loans serving the counties of los angeles and san bernardino 
the loan fees generated from these construction loan products continue to generate greater loan yields 
construction loans generally have a duration of months 
as a result  construction loans generate higher yields than longer term loans because the loan fees are recognized sooner over the life of the construction loan compared to longer term loans

such instruments contributed to an increase in interest expense of about million in as compared to interest expense on these instruments was million  million and  for  and  respectively 
overall  the company s net interest margin compressed modestly from in to in as management of the company continues to manage its interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities by matching the duration of those instruments to mitigate interest rate risk 
further  the net interest income increased from million to million as the volume of earnings assets  in particular  loans  have increased as new loan product lines including single family tract home construction and sba lending were introduced in

table of contents the following table sets forth changes in interest income and interest expense for each major category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability  and the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for the year indicated

the company s allowance for possible loan losses was million or of gross loans at december  compared to million or of gross loans at december  at december   the allowance for possible loan losses was million or of gross loans 
as the volume of loans increases  the level of allowance for possible loan loss would increase accordingly in order to achieve a similar ratio of reserve to loans 
additions to the reserve are effected through the provision for possible loan losses 
also affecting the reserve are loans charged off and loans recovered 
net loan charge offs were   and  for the years ended  and  respectively 
although the company maintains an allowance for possible loan losses at a level it considers to be adequate to provide for losses  based on presently known conditions  there can be no assurance that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations 
the calculation for the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses  and therefore the requisite amount of the provision for possible loan losses  is based on several factors  including underlying loan collateral  delinquency trends  borrower s cash flow and historic loan loss experience 
all of these factors can change without notice based on market and economic conditions and other factors
