results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to total revenue of certain items included in our statements of income for the years indicated year ended july  year ended july  year ended june  net revenue retail sales wholesale and other franchise revenue total revenue cost and expenses cost of sales and related occupancy costs operating expenses depreciation and amortization general and administrative expenses provision for asset impairment and restructuring costs gain on asset disposals total costs and expenses operating income loss interest expense and other  net income loss before income tax provision income tax provision net income loss year ended july  compared to year ended july  total revenue 
total revenue for the year ended july  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended july  this decrease consisted of decreases in retail sales  wholesale and other sales  and franchise revenue 
each component is discussed below 
retail sales revenue for the year ended july  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended july  this decrease was primarily related to the net impact of several factors 
first  the number of company stores decreased in the current year versus the prior year because of the closure of three poorly performing company operated locations  the closure of three company operated kiosks  and the sale of six other company operated locations to franchisees since the beginning of the current fiscal year 
the reduction in retail sales from the unit divestitures noted above was approximately  a summary of company and franchise retail unit activity for both fiscal and can be found above under the caption business diedrich coffee s business model retail outlets 
second  retail sales declined by  or  due to lower comparable store sales for company operated units 
approximately  of this decrease was due to an unfavorable match up to the prior fiscal year  which contained one additional fiscal week versus the current year 
fiscal contained weeks  whereas fiscal contained only weeks 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in retail sales from our internet website 
wholesale revenue for the year ended july  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended july  this decrease was primarily the net result of the following factors roasted coffee sales to franchisees 
sales of roasted coffee to our franchisees decreased  for the year ended july  because of a decrease in the number of domestic franchise stores in the current fiscal year 
this resulted from the closure of domestic franchise locations 
the decrease in domestic store count was compounded by lower sales volumes at open stores 
gloria jean s system comparable sales decreased versus the prior year period  further reducing roasted coffee usage 
coffee sales to restaurants and specialty retailers 
wholesale coffee sales to restaurants and specialty retailers decreased  or  from the prior year 
this decrease primarily resulted from our reduced focus on independent and specialty retailer accounts because many of these accounts represent only a single or few retail locations and require proportionately more resources to support 
coffee sales to grocery retailers 
although we began selling coffee through the grocery distribution channel during our second fiscal quarter this year  revenue on our initial coffee shipments netted to zero because the wholesale selling value of such shipments was applied against our slotting fee obligations to a grocery store chain 
it is customary to pay grocery chains such fees to set up the initial distribution of product in their retail store system 
during our third quarter  such slotting fees were fully covered by our cumulative shipments  and we recognized  in net revenue on subsequent shipments during the balance of the fiscal year 
keurig k cup and other office coffee service sales 
keurig k cup and other office coffee service sales decreased by  for the year ended july   a decrease over the prior year 
this is primarily due to lower sales to two large ocs distributor wholesale customers 
franchise revenue decreased by  or  to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended july  franchise revenue consists of initial franchise fees and franchise renewal fees  area development fees  royalties received on sales at franchised locations  and miscellaneous other franchise revenue  including coordination fees received from product suppliers 
the decrease in franchise revenue is the net impact of several factors 
initial franchise fees and franchise renewal fees increased approximately  on a year to date basis versus the prior year  as a result of an increase in franchise agreements sold or renewed 
franchise royalties decreased  versus the prior year period 
this was the net impact of a reduction in domestic franchise royalties and an increase in international royalties 
domestic royalties decreased primarily because of the unit net reduction in domestic franchise stores from the prior year  and a decrease in franchise comparable store sales 
international royalties increased because of a unit net increase in the number of international outlets compared to the prior year  although international franchise units pay a lower average royalty rate compared to domestic franchises 
miscellaneous other franchise revenue  including vendor coordination fees  decreased by approximately  compared to the prior fiscal year 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs for the year ended july  decreased to  from  for the year ended july  on a margin basis  cost of sales and related occupancy costs decreased to of total revenue during fiscal versus during fiscal this favorable margin basis point change was solely due to a favorable cost of sales margin basis point change  as the occupancy cost margin basis remained consistent in current and prior years 
this margin basis point improvement resulted primarily from two factors 
first  during the current year the company sold twelve company operated units with high cost of sales as a percentage of sales  as discussed above 
second  the company had a  increase in the cost of sales during the prior year  due to a recall of keurig k cups  as discussed below 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended july  decreased by to  from  for the year ended july  on a margin basis  operating expenses increased to of total revenue during the current year from for the prior year 
this unfavorable margin basis point change resulted from several factors 
first  bad debt expense increased  during the current year 
this increase was primarily due to  of expense recognized in the current year  which was comprised of  of bad debt expense recognized partially offset by  in collections of previously reserved for amounts 
in comparison  we reversed  of expense in the prior year  which was comprised of  in bad debt expense recognized  offset by  in collections of previously reserved for amounts 
advertising expense also increased versus the prior year as part of an overall effort to increase comparable store sales in retail units and to add new accounts at the wholesale level 
we also incurred  of new selling expenses in the current year  which are classified as operating expenses  as we launched our grocery store sales program 
as described in the discussion of revenue  this program resulted in nominal new revenue during the current year period because of our accounting for slotting fees and the impact of these new expenses  when analyzed as a percentage of revenue  resulted in an erosion of reported margins 
finally  we experienced an increase in our workers compensation insurance rates in our retail coffeehouses compared to the prior year  resulting in an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
these increases were offset by decreases in labor costs and entertainment expenses due to the sale or closure of the twelve stores noted above  combined with a strategic goal to reduce coffeehouse labor expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased by  or  to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended july  this decrease is primarily due to the closure of six locations and the sale of six locations discussed above 
depreciation also decreased as certain assets at our castroville roasting facility were fully depreciated  combined with the fact that eight capital leases expired during the year ended july  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense decreased by  or  to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended july  on a margin basis  general and administrative expenses increased to of total revenue for the year ended july  from of total revenue for the year ended july  this unfavorable margin basis point change for the year ended july  resulted because many of our general and administrative expenses are relatively fixed  and therefore on a margin basis represent a higher percentage of revenue when our revenue declines 
the reduction in general and administrative expenses dollars was the net impact of reductions in management bonuses and related benefits  rent expense  and accrued store closure expense versus the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by higher spending than a year ago in the areas of franchise sales  real estate  construction and franchise operations  in order to increase our ability to support new franchise store development 
we also incurred recruitment fees in connection with hiring an executive search firm to find a new chief executive officer  and incurred increased directors and officers liability insurance premiums versus a year ago 
asset impairment and restructuring costs 
asset impairment and restructuring costs increased to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended july  this increase is primarily due to a review of our goodwill  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires  among other things  the use of a nonamortization approach for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
goodwill and certain intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
as a result of this review  we modified certain assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test  which lead to an impairment charge of  was recorded during the current fiscal year 
in addition  we recorded asset impairment charges of  due to the reduction of the carrying values associated with four of our coffeehouses 
a charge of  was recorded to reflect the net present value of the remaining lease obligation on a closed coffeehouse in arizona 
these charges were partially offset by a reversal of  in closed store lease reserves associated with a closed coffeehouse in arizona for which a full pass through sublease was obtained 
during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges of  associated with five of our company locations 
this charge was partially offset by an asset impairment reversal of  to write up the book value of a parcel of land based on proceeds received from its subsequent sale 
at the end of fiscal  we agreed to resume operation of four arizona locations  which we had sold in fiscal a charge of  was recorded to reflect the net present value of the remaining lease obligations on these four locations 
in addition  we recorded severance costs and related employee benefits of  associated with the elimination of ten support center positions 
gain on asset disposals 
gain on asset disposals increased to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended july  this increase is primarily related to a net gain of  from the sales and closures of nine locations partially offset by the write off of equipment from other closed locations 
during the prior year  we recognized a net gain of  on the sale of three locations  partially offset by losses on the closure of several locations and the sale of related equipment 
interest expense and other  net 
interest expense and other  net decreased to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended july  this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in one of our bank notes payable from  at july  to  at july   and to a lesser degree  to a reduction in our floating interest rate and the expiration of eight capital leases 
this decrease was partially offset by interest related to a new note payable agreement for  which commenced on april  income tax expense 
net operating losses generated in current and previous years resulted in no federal income tax liability and only a nominal amount of state income tax expense for the years ended july  and july  due to the uncertainty of future taxable income  deferred tax assets resulting from these net operating losses have been fully reserved 
the slight fluctuation in expense between fiscal versus fiscal is due to changes in state income taxes owed in conjunction with the portfolio of company operated gloria jean s units  which are located in a variety of states 
as of july   a net operating loss for federal and state income tax purposes of  and  respectively  is available to be utilized against future taxable income for years through fiscal for federal and fiscal for state  subject to possible annual limitations pertaining to change in ownership rules under the internal revenue code 
year ended july  compared to year ended june  total revenue 
total revenue for the year ended july  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended june  this decrease consisted of decreases in retail sales and wholesale and other sales  partially offset by an increase in franchise revenue 
each component is discussed below 
retail sales revenue for the year ended july  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended june  this decrease represented the net impact of three factors 
first  the number of company stores decreased in the current year versus the prior year because of the closure of eight poorly performing company operated locations since the prior year period and the sale of twelve company operated coffee plantation coffeehouses 
the impact of the reduction in retail sales from the unit closures and sales noted above was approximately  a summary of company and franchise retail unit activity for fiscal can be found above under the caption business diedrich coffee s business model retail outlets 
second  our fiscal year ended july  contained weeks  whereas our fiscal year ended june  included only weeks 
the impact of this extra week on comparable store sales was an increase in retail sales of  during the year ended july  over the prior year 
finally  the balance of the  decrease resulted from a decrease in comparable store sales for company operated units during the year ended july  as compared to the prior year 
wholesale revenue for the year ended july  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended june  this decrease was primarily the net result of the following factors sale of non coffee products to gloria jean s franchisees 
sales of non coffee products decreased by  for the year ended july   a decrease versus the prior year 
these products include paper cups  napkins  sweetener packets  coffee stirrers and coffee related merchandise  such as ceramic mugs and novelties sold in our gloria jean s mall based coffee stores 
we began eliminating most of these lower margin or lower turnover products during fiscal in order to increase our focus on our core coffee operations 
franchisees now purchase these items directly from outside distributors 
roasted coffee sales to franchisees 
sales of roasted coffee to our franchisees decreased  for the year ended july  because of a decrease in the number of domestic franchise stores in the current year 
this resulted from the closure of domestic franchise locations and the transfer of three domestic franchise locations to company locations 
the decrease in domestic store count was compounded by lower sales volumes at open stores 
gloria jean s system comparable sales decreased versus the prior year period  further reducing roasted coffee usage 
coffee sales to restaurants and specialty retailers 
wholesale coffee sales to restaurants and specialty retailers decreased  or from the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to the loss of two chain restaurant accounts since the prior year 
keurig k cup and other office coffee service sales 
keurig k cup and other office coffee service sales increased by  for the year ended july   a increase over the prior year 
this is a continuation of a trend over the past months  as we continue to experience solid growth in this line of business 
as noted in our quarterly reports  shortly after the end of the third quarter  we became aware of a potential product failure regarding certain production runs of keurig k cups produced and shipped during the third quarter 
we immediately notified our wholesale distribution customers of the potential problem and offered to replace any inventory that could be affected 
as of july   all replacement products had been shipped  and revenue had been recognized 
holiday gift basket sales 
holiday gift basket sales increased  or  for the year ended july  versus the prior year due to a change in the gift basket program 
during the prior year  we sold only the roasted coffee component of the holiday gift baskets to a distributor  who then purchased the remaining components of the gift baskets and sold the finished product to our franchisees 
during the current year  we purchased all non coffee components and sold the finished gift baskets directly to our franchisees 
franchise revenue increased by  or  to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended june  franchise revenue consists of initial franchise fees and franchisee renewal fees  area development fees  royalties received on sales at franchised locations  and miscellaneous other franchise revenue as discussed in the table under revenue recognition in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the increase in franchise revenue in fiscal versus fiscal is the net impact of several factors 
franchise royalties increased by  for the year ended july  versus the prior year 
this was the net impact of a reduction in domestic franchise royalties and an increase in international royalties 
domestic royalties decreased because of the unit reduction in domestic franchise stores and a decline in comparable store sales 
international royalties increased because of an increase in the number of units 
initial franchise fees and franchise renewal fees decreased  for the year ended july  versus the prior year  as a result of fewer franchise agreements signed 
miscellaneous other franchise revenue decreased slightly by  compared to the prior year 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs for the year ended july  decreased to  from  for the year ended june  on a margin basis  cost of sales and related occupancy costs decreased to of total revenue during fiscal versus during fiscal this is the impact of a margin basis point decrease in occupancy costs 
the occupancy cost margin improvement resulted primarily from the sale and closure of several under performing units with high occupancy costs as a percentage of sales  as discussed above in the explanation of the change in retail sales 
in addition  we reversed  in closed store reserves  as settlement amounts came out lower than expected 
these reversals were offset by  in additional store closure costs expensed this year 
cost of sales remained constant at of total revenue for both the year ended july  and the year ended june  as noted above  shortly after the end of the third fiscal quarter  we became aware of a product defect regarding certain production runs of keurig k cups produced and shipped during the third quarter 
during our fourth quarter  we shipped  cases of replacement product at a total cost to us of  had this product defect not occurred  cost of sales would have decreased to of total revenue for the year ended july   a margin basis point improvement from the prior year 
this potential margin basis point improvement would have resulted from the favorable margin impact of discontinuing the sale of lower margin non coffee product lines  as noted above in the discussion of changes in wholesale revenue  as well as the closure of eight poorly performing stores as noted above in the discussion of changes in retail revenue 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended july  decreased by to  from  for the year ended june  on a margin basis  operating expenses decreased to of revenue during fiscal versus during fiscal this favorable margin basis point change resulted from several factors 
first  average operating margins improved from the closure of eight poorly performing locations and the sale of twelve other locations as discussed above 
second  wholesale and bad debt expense declined significantly as a result of a number of new collection policy initiatives implemented since the prior year 
because of these new collection policy initiatives significant amounts that had previously been reserved for were recovered  and the  in related bad debt reserves were reversed during the year  as follows  during the first quarter   during the second quarter   during the third quarter  and  during the fourth quarter 
the  in bad debt reserve reversals was partially offset by  in expense recognized for new receivable amounts  which were deemed to become uncollectible during the year 
these favorable factors were offset somewhat by a decrease in comparable store sales versus the prior year and an increase in our medical benefit and workers compensation insurance rates in california 
many operating expenses in a retail unit are semi fixed and  therefore  represent a higher percentage of revenue when retail sales decline 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased by  to  for the year ended july   from  for the year ended june   of this decrease is due to our adoption of sfas as of the beginning of fiscal year as required under sfas  we have completed a goodwill impairment test as of june   determined that there is no indication of goodwill impairment as of this date  and discontinued periodic amortization of goodwill 
goodwill amortization expense was recorded during the prior year period 
in addition  depreciation decreased due to the closure of eight locations and the sale of twelve locations discussed above 
also  certain assets at our castroville roasting facility were fully depreciated during the year ended july  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense decreased by  or  to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended june  on a margin basis  general and administrative expenses increased to of total revenue for the year ended july  from of total revenue for the year ended june  this unfavorable margin basis point change for the year ended july  resulted from several factors 
as noted above  our medical benefit and workers compensation insurance rates in california increased during the year ended july  this increase was largely offset by a restructuring plan specifically intended to reduce overhead 
this restructuring plan eliminated ten support center positions in january asset impairment and restructuring costs 
asset impairment and restructuring costs decreased to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended june  during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges of  associated with five of our company locations 
this charge was partially offset by an asset impairment reversal of  to write up the book value of a parcel of land based on proceeds received from its subsequent sale 
at the end of fiscal  we agreed to resume operation of four arizona locations  which we had sold in fiscal a charge of  was recorded to reflect the net present value of the remaining lease obligations on these four locations 
in addition  we recorded severance costs and related employee benefits of  associated with the elimination of ten support center positions 
during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges of  for twelve coffee plantation stores located in arizona and  relating to property in portland  oregon which was held for sale  and  in impairment charges associated with four company and one franchise operated location 
a charge of  was also recorded to reflect the net present value of our remaining lease obligations on four of the twelve arizona locations 
in addition   in severance costs associated with the relocation of gloria jean s support center and the related elimination of a number of administrative positions  and  in estimated lease termination costs for the planned closure of four under performing company operated locations  were recorded in fiscal gain on asset disposals 
gain on asset disposals increased to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended june   primarily due to the fact that stores were either closed or sold during the year ended july  as opposed to only stores closed or sold during the year ended june  interest expense and other  net 
interest expense and other  net decreased to  for the year ended july  from  for the year ended june  this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in our bank note payable from  at june  to  at july   and to a lesser degree  to a reduction in our floating interest rate 
income tax expense 
net operating losses generated in previous years resulted in no federal income tax liability and only a nominal amount of state income tax expense for the years ended july  and june  due to the uncertainty of future taxable income  deferred tax assets resulting from these net operating losses have been fully reserved 
the slight fluctuation in expense between fiscal versus fiscal is due to changes in state income taxes owed in conjunction with the portfolio of company operated gloria jean s units  which are located in a variety of states 
as of july   a net operating loss for federal income tax purposes of  is available to be utilized against future taxable income for years through fiscal  subject to possible annual limitations pertaining to change in ownership rules under the internal revenue code 
financial condition and liquidity and capital resources current financial condition at july   diedrich coffee had working capital of  total assets of  and  of stockholders equity  compared to a working capital of  total assets of  and  of stockholders equity at july  cash flows cash provided by operating activities totaled  for the year ended july  as compared to cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended july  this improvement is the net result of many factors more fully enumerated in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net cash used by investing activities for the year ended july  totaled  as compared with  in net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended july  during the year ended july   we received  in proceeds from the sale of assets  including  from the sale of three coffeehouses in arizona   from the sale of three coffeehouses in new england  and  from the sale of land in oregon 
we also received  in principal payments on notes receivable that were issued in the prior year by the buyer of twelve locations in arizona 
these proceeds and notes receivable payments were partially offset by  in property and equipment expenditures 
during the year ended july   we received  in proceeds from the sale of assets  including  for the sale of twelve company operated locations in arizona   for the sale of land and a building in oregon  and  for the sale of one company operated location in hawaii 
we also received  in principal payments on notes receivable that were issued by the buyer of the twelve locations in arizona 
these proceeds and notes receivable payments were partially offset by  in property and equipment expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities totaled  for the year ended july   consisting of  in principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations 
these principal payments were partially offset by  of additional borrowings 
net cash used in financing activities totaled  for the year ended july   consisting of  in principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations and  in payments related to transaction costs associated with our issuance of common stock during our fiscal year ended june  outstanding debt and financing arrangements on july   we entered into a credit agreement with bankboston  na subsequently merged into fleet national bank  which was secured by a pledge of all of our assets and our subsidiaries stock 
it initially provided for a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
we did not draw down any borrowings under the revolving credit facility during the time it was in place  although the credit facility once secured a maximum of  of outstanding letters of credit 
amounts outstanding under the credit agreement did bear interest  at our option  at fleet s base rate plus or an adjusted eurodollar rate plus 
at july   the applicable interest rate was  which was based on the eurodollar rate at the time 
the rate could be fixed over periods ranging from one to six months  at our discretion 
on september  we entered into a new credit agreement with united california bank  doing business as bank of the west  or bow  in order to repay the balance of all remaining amounts owed to fleet under our amended credit agreement with fleet 
under the bow credit agreement  we immediately borrowed  under a replacement term loan  the proceeds of which were used to repay our fleet term loan on september   the amended maturity date of the fleet term loan 
our obligations to bow under the credit agreement are secured by all of our assets  including the stock of each of our subsidiaries each of which guarantees our obligations under the agreement  as well as all intangible assets we own  including the intellectual property and trademark assets that we and our subsidiaries own 
the term loan with bow requires monthly principal payments of  over months and all amounts we owe under the term loan must be repaid by march  under the original terms of the credit agreement  we were required to make monthly interest payments on amounts outstanding under the replacement term loan  computed at either bow s prime rate plus or a libor rate plus 
under the amended terms of the credit agreement  we are required to make monthly interest payments on amounts outstanding under the replacement term loan  computed at either bow s prime rate plus or a libor rate plus 
we may periodically elect to convert portions of our prime rate based borrowings under the credit agreement into libor based borrowings in  increments  subject to restrictions contained in the agreement 
in addition to the term loan  the bow credit agreement provided us with a revolving  equipment acquisition credit line for the acquisition of specified coffee packaging equipment 
under the terms of the agreement  amounts borrowed under this line were set to convert to one or more term loans with monthly principal amortization payments beginning september   and were required to be repaid in full by august  the original terms of the credit agreement required that we pay interest on any borrowings outstanding under this equipment line on a monthly basis at an interest rate computed in the same manner as described above for the term loan 
on april   the company borrowed  under this credit line and this balance converted to a term loan on august  the equipment term loan is secured by the coffee packaging equipment purchased with the proceeds  as well as an  restricted cash balance on deposit with bow  which was a requirement imposed by a third amendment to the credit agreement as described below 
the equipment term loan calls for monthly principal payments of  plus interest through the maturity date of august  as of august   the interest rate was 
pursuant to the terms of the third amendment to the credit agreement  the interest rate of the equipment term loan is fixed at until the loan is repaid 
the bow credit agreement initially provided us with two additional  lines of credit for new coffeehouse development  one applicable to borrowings during our fiscal year ending in  and the other to borrowings during our fiscal year ending in as described more fully below  these two lines of credit for coffeehouse development were subsequently eliminated by amendments to the agreement  and we never borrowed any amounts under these facilities prior to their elimination 
finally  the bow credit agreement provides us with a  revolving working capital and letter of credit facility  subject to a number of restrictions 
our working capital facility draws and letters of credit are limited to a combined maximum of  outstanding at any time 
furthermore  draw downs against our working capital facility are subject to a sub limit of  and letters of credit are subject to a sub limit of  under the original terms of the credit agreement  we were permitted to draw funds against our working capital facility during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year  although letters of credit issued under the letter of credit facility may be outstanding throughout the year 
pursuant to the terms of the third amendment  we are permitted to draw funds against the working capital facility throughout the fiscal year  rather than only during the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
we may repay amounts that we borrow under the working capital facility at any time  and we may therefore be able to re borrow such funds on a revolving basis subject to restrictions including those summarized above 
any payments made by bow with regard to any letter of credit issued under the letter of credit facility must be repaid by us immediately upon the date of such payment by bow 
as of july   bow had issued one letter of credit for we are subject to a number of additional restrictions under our new credit agreement  as amended 
these include limitations on our ability to sell assets  make capital expenditures  incur additional indebtedness  permit new liens upon our assets  and pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock 
we must also maintain compliance with agreed upon financial covenants that limit the amount of indebtedness that we may have outstanding in relation to our tangible net worth  require us to maintain a specified minimum dollar value level of tangible net worth  require us to maintain a specified minimum dollar value level of ebitda for the trailing four fiscal quarters and certain minimum ratios of cash flow to debt service obligations  require us to maintain a specified minimum level of profitability  and require us to maintain a minimum cash balance on deposit with bow equal to the lesser of  or the outstanding principal balance of our equipment term loan 
effective december   based upon our assessment that we would otherwise be unable to comply with one of the covenants contained in the credit agreement  we and bow executed a first amendment to the credit agreement  which reduced our trailing four fiscal quarter ebitda requirement and increased the interest rate on the replacement term loan from a spread of over libor to a spread of over libor 
the interest rate spread for our option to compute interest based on bow s reference rate was unchanged under this amendment 
effective march   based upon our assessment that we might otherwise be unable to comply with one of the covenants contained in the credit agreement  as amended  we and bow executed a second amendment to the credit agreement 
among other matters  the second amendment modified a covenant that we would have otherwise failed to meet due to our net loss for the quarter ended march  in addition  the second amendment modified the terms of the credit agreement to eliminate the unutilized  line of credit for new coffeehouse development during our fiscal year  and imposed new restrictions on our ability to utilize the separate  line of credit for new coffeehouse development during our fiscal year 
effective july   based upon our assessment that we would otherwise be unable to comply with certain covenants contained in the credit agreement  as amended  we and bow executed a third amendment to the credit agreement 
among other matters  the amendment modified a covenant that we would have otherwise failed to meet due to our net loss for the quarter ended july   as well as a number of other financial covenants with respect to future periods  including covenants that relate to our tangible net worth  ebitda  profitability  cash flow  and debt to net tangible net worth ratio 
the third amendment also modified covenants to give us more flexibility to sell assets in certain bank approved transactions and to increase our ability to make capital expenditures 
in addition  the third amendment modified the terms of the credit agreement to eliminate the unutilized  line of credit for new coffeehouse development during our fiscal year ending  imposed a new  restricted cash collateral requirement securing the equipment term loan to be established by the company as of october   modified the previous  minimum cash on deposit financial covenant to apply only after the equipment loan is repaid  renewed our  revolving working capital facility through april   and made it available throughout the fiscal year rather than the previous restriction of availability during only the first and fourth fiscal quarters  and extended our letter of credit facility through october  the third amendment to the credit agreement also increased the interest rate on the replacement term loan from a spread of over libor to a spread of over libor  or  at our option  from a spread of over bow s reference rate to a spread of over bow s reference rate 
the third amendment also fixed the interest rate of our equipment term loan at 
based upon the terms of our bank credit agreement  as amended  our recent operating performance and business outlook  and status of our balance sheet  we believe that cash from operations  cash and cash equivalents  and funds available under our bank credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs at the anticipated operating levels for at least the next twelve months 
other commitments the following represents a comprehensive list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of july  payments due by period total thereafter in thousands note payable    capital leases operating leases      green coffee commitments   we have obligations under non cancelable operating leases for our coffee houses  roasting facility and administrative offices 
lease terms are generally for ten to twenty years with renewal options and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area and other operating costs 
some retail leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds 
in addition  we are contingently liable on the master leases for franchise locations 
under our historical franchising business model  we executed the master leases for these locations  and entered into subleases on the same terms with our franchisees  who all pay their rent directly to the landlords 
should any of these franchisees default on their subleases  we would be responsible 
our maximum theoretical future exposure at july   computed as the sum of all remaining lease payments through the expiration dates of the respective leases  was  this amount does not take into consideration any mitigating measures we could take to reduce this exposure in the event of default  including re leasing the locations  or terminating the master lease by negotiating a lump payment to the landlord less than the sum of all remaining future rents 
on august  we executed a seven year lease for a new home office facility  at a base rent amount of  per month  to become effective in october on september  we executed a three year lease for a secondary warehouse  at a base rent amount of  per month  to become effective in october critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
accounts significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  franchise receivables  allowance for bad debt reserves  assets held for sale  fixed asset lives  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  store closure reserves  and contingencies 
we believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion  however  does not list all of our accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition franchise operations initial franchise fees are recognized when a franchised coffeehouse begins operations  at which time we have performed our obligations related to such fees 
fees received pursuant to area development agreements  which grant the right to develop franchised units in future periods in specific geographic areas  are deferred and recognized on a pro rata basis as the franchised units subject to the development agreements begin operations 
in light of our revenue recognition policies  we have little or no control over when we recognize revenue related to these initial franchise fees and area development fees 
we monitor the financial condition of franchisees and record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our franchisees are unable to make required payments to us 
additionally  we cease recording royalties from franchisees that are over days delinquent in paying us until we have a history of payments being made when due 
if sales or economic conditions worsen for our franchisees  their financial performance may worsen  our collection rates may decline and we may be required to assume their responsibility for lease payments on franchised stores 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment when the operations of one or more of our brands experience a negative event  including  but not limited to  a significant downturn in sales  a substantial loss of customers  an unfavorable change in demographics or unit closures 
upon the occurrence of a negative event  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows for the individual units that are affected by the negative event 
if the projected cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the assets allocated to each unit  we write down the assets to fair value based on the estimated net proceeds we believe we can obtain for the unit upon sale  the discounted projected cash flows derived from the unit  or the historical net proceeds obtained from sales of similar units 
the most significant assumptions in our analysis are those used when we estimate a unit s future cash flows 
we generally use the assumptions in our strategic plan and modify them as necessary based on unit specific information 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our operating unit assets may be overstated or understated 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
our goodwill impairment analysis uses estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
as a result of our recent changes in executive management  we are currently reviewing our competitive position in certain markets in order to better align our resources with our growth stratey 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated 
our annual impairment measurement date is our fiscal year end 
store closure reserves we decide whether to close a unit based on its recent cash flows and its future estimated profitability 
we evaluate each unit s performance each financial period 
when units perform poorly  we consider the demographics of the location as well as our ability to cause an unprofitable unit to become profitable 
based on management s judgment  we estimate the future cash flows of the unit 
if we determine that the unit will not be profitable  and there are no contractual requirements that require us to continue to operate the unit  we close the unit 
we establish a reserve for the net present value of the unit s future rents and other fixed costs at the time the unit is closed 
the most significant assumptions we make in determining store closure reserves are assumptions regarding the estimated costs to maintain vacant properties 
additionally  the amount of the reserve established for future lease payments on leased vacant units is dependent on our ability to successfully negotiate early termination lease agreements with our landlords 
if the costs to maintain properties rise or if it takes longer than anticipated to sell properties or terminate leases  we may need to record additional reserves 
new accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires prospective application for contracts entered into or modified after june   except for contracts which exist in fiscal quarters that began prior to june   and for hedging relationships designated after june  for existing contracts for fiscal quarters that began prior to june   the provisions of this statement that relate to sfas no 
implementation issues should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates 
sfas no 
requires that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly 
management does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no

sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective for the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of a nonpublic entity for which this statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning december  management does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first year or interim period beginning after june  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  management has not yet determined the impact of implementing interpretation other matters seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations as well as economic trends that affect retailers in general 
historically  our net sales have not been realized proportionately in each quarter  with net sales being the highest during the second fiscal quarter  which includes the november december holiday season 
hot weather tends to reduce sales 
quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores  which may not occur as anticipated due to events outside our control 
as a result of these factors  and of the other contingencies and risk factors described elsewhere in this report  the financial results for any individual quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved in a full fiscal year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive items entered into for trading purposes none 
market risk sensitive items entered into for other than trading purposes we have exposure to market risk from two primary sources interest rate risk and commodity price risk 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our outstanding bank debt 
at july   we had two loans totaling  that could be affected by changes in short term interest rates 
at fiscal year end  the interest rates ranged from to 
these rates can be fixed over periods ranging from one to six months  at our discretion 
at july   a hypothetical basis point increase in the adjusted rates would result in additional interest expense of  on an annualized basis 
commodity price risk green coffee  the principal raw material for our products  is subject to significant price fluctuations caused by a number of factors  including weather  political  and economic conditions 
to date  we have not used commodity based financial instruments to hedge against fluctuations in the price of coffee 
to ensure that we have an adequate supply of coffee  however  we enter into agreements to purchase green coffee in the future that may or may not be fixed as to price 
at july   we had commitments to purchase coffee through fiscal year  totaling  for  pounds of green coffee  the majority of which were fixed as to price 
the coffee scheduled to be delivered to us in fiscal year pursuant to these commitments will satisfy approximately of our anticipated green coffee requirements for this fiscal year 
assuming we require approximately  additional pounds of green coffee during fiscal for which no price has yet been fixed  each per pound increase in the price of green coffee could result in  of additional cost 
however  because the price we pay for green coffee is negotiated with suppliers  we believe that the commodity market price for green coffee would have to increase significantly  as much as per pound  before suppliers would increase the price they charge us
