item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
oil and gas prices 
prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely 
oil and gas prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce  and the accounting for our oil and gas activities 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production to  among other things  reduce our exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
reserve replacement 
as is generally the case  our producing properties in the gulf of mexico and the onshore gulf coast often have high initial production rates  followed by steep declines 
as a result  we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production 
substantial capital expenditures are required to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
significant estimates 
we believe the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates we must make in connection with the preparation of our financial statements are remaining proved oil and gas reserves  timing of our future drilling activities  future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties  allocating the purchase price associated with business combinations  and the valuation of our derivative positions 
please see critical accounting policies and estimates and other factors affecting our business and financial results in this item for a more detailed discussion of the foregoing matters 
results of operations revenues 
all of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production and the settlement of hedging contracts associated with our production 
our revenues may vary significantly from year to year as a result of changes in commodity prices 
revenues for were lower than primarily because of lower natural gas prices  a decrease in oil and condensate production and downtime in the gulf of mexico associated with tropical storm isidore 
the increase in revenues in when compared to was primarily due to a increase in production and higher realized natural gas prices

for purposes of this table  average realized prices for natural gas and oil and condensate are presented net of all applicable transportation expenses  which reduced the realized price of natural gas by  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
the realized price of oil and condensate was reduced by  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
average realized prices include the effects of hedging 
production 
our total oil and gas production stated on a natural gas equivalent basis increased in production increased because of acquisitions including eex and successful drilling efforts 
these increases were partially offset by our decision to voluntarily curtail approximately one bcf of production in the first quarter of in response to low prices and by the shut in of four bcfe in the second half of the year in response to storms in the gulf of mexico 
gas production in increased primarily through our acquisition of properties in the mid continent  partially offset by our decision to voluntarily curtail approximately five bcfe in the fourth quarter of in response to low commodity prices 
natural gas 
our natural gas production increased nearly when compared to the increase was the result of successful drilling in the gulf of mexico and mid continent and the acquisition of eex in late partially offsetting this increase was the voluntary curtailment in the first quarter of in response to low prices and the shut in during the second half of the year related to storms in the gulf of mexico 
our natural gas production increased over about half of the production increase in came from the mid continent acquisition  which closed in january our development drilling programs in south texas and the gulf of mexico also were major contributors to our production growth 
gains in production were partially offset by natural declines from other producing properties 
crude oil and condensate 
our oil production decreased about when compared to  primarily reflecting natural field declines in australia and the us partially offsetting these declines were increases at high island  viosca knoll and other gulf of mexico fields 
our crude oil production in increased over levels 
this increase primarily related to our early acquisition in the mid continent and the success of our drilling efforts  partially offset by natural declines in australia 
effect of hedging on realized prices 
the following table presents information about the effect of our hedging program on realized prices 
average realized prices ratio of hedged to with without non hedged hedge hedge price natural gas year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  crude oil and condensate year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  the ratio is determined by dividing the realized price which includes the effects of hedging by the price that otherwise would have been realized without hedging activities 
operating expenses 
the following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended december unit of production amount per mcfe in thousands year ended year ended december  percentage december  percentage increase increase decrease decrease united states lease operating   production and other taxes   transportation   depreciation  depletion and amortization   general and administrative exclusive of stock compensation   total operating   australia lease operating   production and other taxes   transportation depreciation  depletion and amortization   general and administrative exclusive of stock compensation   total operating   total lease operating   production and other taxes   transportation   depreciation  depletion and amortization   general and administrative exclusive of stock compensation   total operating   stock compensation charges were  or per mcfe  for and  or per mcfe  for total operating expense inclusive of these charges was  or per mcfe  for and  or per mcfe  for our total operating expense for  stated on a unit of production basis  increased over the increase was primarily related to the following items 
lease operating expense during included a million non recurring expense associated with a workover of a well at south marsh island without the effect of the workover  domestic lease operating expense would have increased  or per unit  as a result of several non routine repairs to gathering lines and other offshore facilities in the gulf of mexico and a slight increase in well service costs in the mid continent 
although our domestic production subject to production taxes increased in  our production tax expense decreased because of a drop in natural gas prices for the year 
the increase in our dd a rate was primarily related to the increased cost of reserve additions 
the cost of reserve additions was adversely affected by the quantity of proved reserves added and increases in the cost of drilling goods and services and platforms and facilities construction during the first half of the increase is partially offset by our fourth quarter ceiling test writedown of our oil and gas properties 
general and administrative expense increased primarily because of a growing domestic workforce and the opening of our office in london  england 
maintenance on our fpsos resulted in higher australian lease operating expense during this million decrease from to was partially offset on a per unit basis by the decrease in production in australian capital expenditures are deductible against production taxes otherwise payable 
production taxes are due on a june fiscal year 
we accrue production taxes during the tax fiscal year based on our estimate of revenues and capital expenditures for the fiscal year 
the estimate of such taxes for the current year reflects lower actual and anticipated future capital expenditures in australia 
the increase in the australian dd a rate during was primarily a result of our unsuccessful exploratory drilling efforts in and the significant increase in australian general and administrative expense for relates to costs incurred in connection with the relocation of the previous manager of our australian operations to our tulsa  oklahoma office and the relocation of the current manager of our australian operations from houston  texas to perth  australia 
on a per unit basis  the increase is magnified by the decline in our production in australia 
the following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended december  unit of production amount per mcfe in thousands year ended year ended december  percentage december  percentage increase increase decrease decrease united states lease operating   production and other taxes   transportation   depreciation  depletion and amortization   general and administrative exclusive of stock compensation   total operating   australia lease operating   production and other taxes   transportation depreciation  depletion and amortization   general and administrative exclusive of stock compensation  total operating   total lease operating   production and other taxes   transportation   depreciation  depletion and amortization   general and administrative exclusive of stock compensation   total operating   stock compensation charges were  or per mcfe  for and  or per mcfe  for total operating expense inclusive of these charges was  or per mcfe  for and  or per mcfe  for our total operating expense exclusive of the ceiling test writedowns in and for  stated on a unit of production basis  increased over because of higher lease operating  production tax  dd a and g a expenses 
the reasons for these increases are described below 
the increased lease operating expense per mcfe reflected higher oilfield service costs in all our domestic focus areas and relatively higher australian lease operating expense associated with the operation and maintenance of our two fpsos 
the increase in production and other taxes was primarily related to higher natural gas prices  our expanding onshore gulf coast operations and the acquisition of our mid continent properties in early the increase was partly offset by resource rent tax in australia  which was lower in compared to due to unsuccessful drilling efforts 
the increase in the domestic dd a rate was primarily related to lower than expected reserve additions from several wells  increases in the cost of drilling goods and services and platforms and facilities construction and the completion of several higher cost wells 
the increase in the australian dd a rate was primarily a result of our unsuccessful drilling activities in the increase on a unit of production basis in g a expense primarily was due to our growing workforce 
performance based compensation  excluding stock compensation expense  was negatively impacted by the fourth quarter ceiling test writedown 
performance based compensation  a component of general and administrative expense  was million  or per mcfe  in compared to million  or per mcfe  in writedown of oil and gas properties 
we did not writedown any of our oil and gas properties in at december   we had million of other international costs that were not subject to amortization 
these costs primarily represent our exploration efforts in china s bohai bay 
we continue to appraise the commerciality of our two field discoveries cfd and cfd south 
we have not yet booked any reserves associated with these discoveries 
we are not the operator of and do not own a controlling interest in these fields 
as a result  we do not control the appraisal and determination of commerciality of these fields 
if we determine that one or both of these fields are not commercially viable  we will likely be required to impair the value of our assets in this area 
at december   the unamortized cost of our domestic oil and gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling 
in accordance with full cost accounting rules  we recorded a domestic ceiling test writedown at december  of million million after tax 
based on an interim interpretation from the sec that is applicable to all companies that use the full cost method of accounting  the full cost ceiling test impairment calculations took into account the effects of hedging 
this interim interpretation  which is subject to further consideration by the sec before it is finalized  requires that certain conditions be met in order to take into account the effects of hedging in the calculation of full cost ceiling test impairment  including that the hedges qualify under sfas and are documented and designated as such and that the policy be applied on a consistent basis whether or not the hedged price is higher than the current market price 
the writedown would have been million million after tax if we had not used hedge adjusted prices 
interest expense 
the following table presents information about our interest expense for each of the years in the three year period ended december year ended december  in millions gross interest expense capitalized interest net interest expense distributions on preferred securities total interest expense and distributions in  interest expense increased in part because of higher debt levels outstanding under our credit arrangements 
interest expense also increased as a result of debt incurred in connection with eex acquisition in late november in august  we issued million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due to finance a portion of the acquisition 
interest that accrued prior to the closing of the acquisition was capitalized as a cost of the transaction 
following the acquisition  eex retained the obligations associated with its secured notes which accrue interest at rate of per year and a forward gas sales contract valued at approximately million with an effective interest rate of per year 
in  total interest expense was higher than due to borrowings related to our acquisition in the mid continent and the issuance of million principal of our senior notes in february in  our interest expense included interest from borrowings in january to finance our acquisition of three producing properties in south texas for million 
unrealized commodity derivative income expense 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
effective january   we are now required to record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value 
the million of unrealized income for the year ended december  primarily reflects the change in the time value of our open hedging contracts 
in  the unrealized expense of million represents the settlement of those same hedging contracts and primarily reflects the reversal of the time value gains that were previously recognized during taxes 
the effective tax rate for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in was less than the statutory tax rate primarily due to a million tax benefit resulting from revised tax legislation enacted in australia in the effective tax rate was less than the statutory tax rate in because the valuation allowance on our australian net operating loss carryforwards was reduced by million primarily as a result of a substantial increase in estimated taxable income 
estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices  estimates of the timing and amount of future production and estimates of future operating and capital costs 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations 
our annual capital budget is established at the beginning of each year 
because of the nature of the properties we own  only a small portion of our capital budget is nondiscretionary 
the size of our budget is driven by expected cash flow from operations 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors  including drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions  the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which proved properties are acquired 
based on current commodity prices and our hedges  we currently anticipate that our cash flow will exceed our capital budget which excludes acquisitions by more than million in this excess should allow us to pay down debt and other obligations or repurchase shares of our common stock during the year 
credit arrangements 
we maintain our reserve based revolving credit facility with chase manhattan bank  as agent 
the banks participating in the facility have committed to lend us up to million 
the amount available under the facility is subject to a calculated borrowing base determined by banks holding of the aggregate commitments 
the borrowing base is reduced by the principal amount of outstanding senior notes million at march   of the principal amount of any outstanding senior subordinated notes a reduction of million at march   the outstanding principal amount of the secured notes million at march  and an agreed valuation for the gas sales obligation million at march  
the borrowing base will be redetermined at least semi annually and  after reduction for the foregoing items  was million at march  no assurances can be given that the banks will not elect to redetermine the borrowing base in the future 
the facility contains restrictions on the payment of dividends and the incurrence of debt as well as other customary covenants and restrictions 
the facility matures on january  we expect to complete an amendment of the facility during the first quarter of that would extend the maturity to january  we also have money market lines of credit with various banks in an amount limited by our credit facility to million 
at march   we had outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of million and outstanding borrowings under our money market lines of million 
consequently  at march   we had approximately million of available capacity under our credit arrangements 
at december  and  the interest rate was and  respectively  for libor based loans under our credit facility and and  respectively  for the loans outstanding under our money market lines of credit 
working capital 
our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements 
generally  we use excess cash to pay down borrowings under our credit arrangements 
as a result  we often have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital 
we had a working capital deficit of million as of december  this compares to a working capital surplus of million at the end of and million at the end of our working capital deficit included an million note payment due january and accrued severance costs associated with the eex acquisition 
cash flows from operations 
our net cash flows from operations in declined when compared to the decrease is primarily due to lower gas prices and higher general and administrative expenses  partially offset by higher production volumes 
our net cash flows from operations were million in and million in the increase in over is primarily attributable to higher commodity prices and increased production volumes  offset by increased operating expenses 
capital expenditures 
our capital spending was million  a increase over the previous year 
the largest component of our capital spending was the million eex acquisition 
in  we also invested in us development  million in domestic exploration  million in other domestic acquisitions and million internationally 
in  our capital spending totaled million  including million in acquisitions 
the largest component of acquisition spending was our first quarter acquisition in the mid continent 
in  we invested million in development  million in domestic exploration and million internationally 
total spending in was million 
our capital spending program included million for acquisitions  million for development  million for domestic exploration and million for international activities 
we budgeted million for capital spending  excluding uncompleted acquisitions  in we expect that of this budget will be invested in the gulf of mexico including deepwater  in onshore us and the balance in international projects 
we anticipate that our capital expenditure budget for will be funded from cash flow from operations 
to the extent that cash receipts during the year are slower than capital needs  we will make up the short fall with borrowings under our credit arrangements 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors  including the extent to which proved properties are acquired  drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions and the prices and availability of goods and services 
we continue to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities  however  the timing  size and purchase price of acquisitions are unpredictable 
historically  we have completed several acquisitions of varying sizes each year 
depending on the timing of an acquisition  we may spend additional capital during the year of acquisition for drilling and development activities on the acquired properties 
contractual cash obligations the table below summarizes our significant contractual cash payment obligations and commitments  other than hedging contracts  by maturity as of december  hedging contracts are excluded because they are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and other factors

senior notes 
in february  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due priced at of par with a yield to maturity of 
net proceeds from the offering of million were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility incurred in connection with our january mid continent acquisition 
in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due interest on our senior notes is payable semi annually 
our senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations 
we may redeem some or all of our senior notes at any time before their maturity at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability to  among other things incur debt secured by certain liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  and enter into merger or consolidation transactions 
the indentures also provide that if any of our subsidiaries guarantee any of our indebtedness at any time in the future  then we will cause our senior notes to be equally and ratably guaranteed by that subsidiary 
senior subordinated notes 
on august   we sold million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due priced with a yield to maturity of 
the net proceeds from the offering of approximately million were used to repay eex debt that became due at the closing of the acquisition and to pay transaction costs 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually 
interest accruing prior to the closing of the eex acquisition was capitalized as a cost of the transaction 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to all of our present and future senior indebtedness 
we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time on or after august  at a redemption price stated in the indenture governing the notes 
prior to august   we may redeem all but not part of the notes at a redemption price based on a make whole amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
in addition  before august   we may redeem up to of the original principal amount of the notes with the net cash proceeds of certain sales of our common stock at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes limits our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  make restricted payments  pay dividends on or redeem our capital stock  make certain investments  create liens  make certain dispositions of assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  and engage in mergers  consolidations and certain sales of assets 
secured notes 
in the second quarter of  eex assumed the obligations under the secured notes in connection with the termination of two leveraged leasing arrangements 
the notes accrue interest at a rate of per year and are secured by the floating production system and pipelines described in note  oil and gas assets assets held for sale  to our consolidated financial statements 
redemption of the notes prior to may require us to pay make whole premiums 
principal is payable in annual installments on january of each year except with the final installment due in the following is a summary of principal amounts by year of maturity at december  in thousands thereafter  total secured notes  less current maturities  total long term secured notes  gas sales obligation 
in  eex entered into a gas forward sales contract with bob west treasure llc bwt  an affiliate of enron corporation 
pursuant to the gas sales contract  eex committed to deliver approximately bcfe of production to bwt in exchange for proceeds of million 
bwt receives an adjusted market price as the volumes are delivered 
eex also has an obligation to market the delivered volumes of gas for bwt 
under the terms of the gas sales contract  eex is required to make a cash payment if the committed gas volumes are not delivered 
additionally  bwt holds liens on certain of eex s oil and gas properties as security if the committed gas volumes are not delivered or the cash payments are not made 
payments under the gas sales contract are amortized as the underlying gas is delivered under the interest method using an interest rate of 
as of december   the unamortized balance was approximately million and the fair value of the remaining obligation was approximately million 
the interest portion of the payment is included as a component of interest expense in our consolidated income statement 
eex also guaranteed bwt s performance under certain swap agreements between bwt and enron entered into concurrently with the gas sales contract 
if bwt fails to make payments under the swap agreements  eex must perform under the guarantee by paying enron on bwt s behalf 
the maximum amount that eex could be required to pay under this guarantee is not determinable and would depend on the settlement value of the swaps at the time of any bwt default 
bwt  which is outside of the enron bankruptcy proceedings  continues to meet its contractual obligations under its swap agreements and  therefore  eex has not been required to perform under this guarantee 
on march   we reached an agreement with bwt  certain lenders and insurers of bwt and the unsecured creditors committee of enron to terminate eex s gas sales contract 
the agreement  which is subject to the final approval of the enron bankruptcy court  provides for the termination of the gas sales contract  the swaps entered into in connection with the gas sales contract and any other agreements between eex  bwt and enron related to the gas sales contract  including the guarantee and all liens and other security interests on eex s properties  in exchange for a payment to bwt representing the remaining unamortized obligation under the gas sales contract  the fair market value of the swaps  an agreed upon value of million for bwt s limited membership interest in an eex subsidiary that bwt acquired in conjunction with the gas sales contract 
convertible trust preferred securities 
in august  a subsidiary of our company that is a delaware business trust issued million million securities having a liquidation preference of each of cumulative quarterly income convertible preferred securities  series a 
the proceeds from the issuance of these securities commonly referred to as trust preferred securities were used to purchase million of our company s junior subordinated convertible debentures due the interest terms and payment dates of the debentures correspond to the distribution terms of the trust preferred securities 
the debentures are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
the trust preferred securities accrue and pay distributions quarterly in arrears at a rate of per annum on the stated liquidation of the securities 
the trust preferred securities are convertible at the option of the holder at any time into our common stock at the rate of shares of our common stock per trust preferred security the equivalent of a conversion price of per share of our common stock 
the trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the debentures in august  and on a proportionate basis to the extent of any earlier redemption of the debentures by us 
the debentures are redeemable by us at any time 
for a more detailed description of the trust preferred securities  see note  convertible preferred securities of newfield financial trust i  to our consolidated financial statements 
stock repurchase program on may   we announced that our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
through december   we had purchased  shares for total consideration of million at an average of per share 
during  no shares were purchased under this program 
in february  our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million from that date forward to repurchase shares of our common stock 
as a result  additional repurchases may be effected from time to time in accordance with applicable securities laws through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the market or in privately negotiated transactions 
no limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program 
subject to applicable securities laws  purchases will be at times and in amounts  as we deem appropriate 
as of february   no shares had been purchased during the first quarter of hedging we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next months as part of our risk management program 
we use hedging to reduce price volatility  help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and return on some of our acquisitions 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions 
approximately of our production was subject to hedge positions 
in  of our production was subject to hedge positions  compared to in while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
at december   bank of montreal  morgan stanley and j aron company were the counterparties with respect to of our future hedged production 
such contracts are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
please see the discussion in note  commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this report

the actual cash price we receive  however  generally is about per barrel less than the nymex west texas intermediate price when adjusted for location and quality differences 
our australian production is not hedged 
substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the nymex 
the estimated fair value of these transactions is based upon various factors that include closing exchange prices on the nymex  over the counter quotations  volatility and the time value of options 
the calculation of the fair value of collars and floors requires the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions are sensitive to material changes in the future due to various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for discussion purposes  we have divided our significant policies into three categories 
set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category 
we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method 
this method of accounting requires the following significant estimates remaining proved oil and gas reserves  costs withheld from amortization  and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties 
accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the allocation of the purchase price 
accounting for hedging activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the valuation of hedge positions 
oil and gas activities accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
two generally accepted methods for accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
the most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment 
the successful efforts method requires exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs 
both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities 
impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value  while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves  using period end prices and costs and a discount rate 
full cost method 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers the amortization base that are established on a country by country basis 
such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells  dry hole costs  lease acquisition costs and delay rentals 
capitalized costs also include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other expenses that are directly related to our oil and gas activities 
interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development also are capitalized 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties  plus an estimate of our future development and abandonment costs  are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves 
amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis 
proved oil and gas reserves 
our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
changes in oil and gas prices  operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves are revised upward  earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense 
likewise  if reserves are revised downward  earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown 
full cost ceiling limitation 
under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess 
if required  it would reduce earnings and impact stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods 
the ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
given the volatility of natural gas and oil prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves will change in the near term 
if natural gas and oil prices decline  even if for only a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the future net revenues associated with our estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant 
however  we may not be subject to a writedown if prices increase subsequent to the end of a quarter in which a writedown might otherwise be required 
based on an interim interpretation from the sec  the full cost ceiling test impairment calculations may take into consideration the effects of hedging if certain conditions are met 
see results of operations writedown of oil and gas properties in this item costs withheld from amortization 
unevaluated costs are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties associated with these costs 
the costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage  unamortized seismic data  wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base 
leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established 
if a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involves a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors  including our drilling plans  availability of capital  project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage 
at december   we had approximately million of costs excluded from our amortization base 
because the application of the full cost ceiling test at december  resulted in a significant excess of the cost center ceiling over the carrying value of our oil and gas properties  inclusion of some or all of our unevaluated property costs in our amortization base  without adding any associated reserves  would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown 
however  our future depletion rate will increase to the extent such costs are transferred without any associated reserves 
future development and abandonment costs 
future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves  including drilling costs and the installation of production equipment 
future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our offshore production platforms  fpsos  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically occur many years in the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technologies and the future political and regulatory environment 
allocation of purchase price in business combinations as part of our growth strategy  we actively pursue the acquisition of oil and gas properties 
the purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date  which may occur many months after the announcement date 
therefore  while the consideration to be paid may be fixed  the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date 
our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties 
to the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired  we would be required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but must be evaluated periodically for impairment 
we have not recorded goodwill in connection with any of our previous acquisitions 
hedging activities beginning in  the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
we have elected to designate all of our derivative instruments as hedges against the price we will receive for our future oil and natural gas production 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
because our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting  to the extent that changes in their fair values offset changes in the expected cash flows from our forecasted production  such amounts are not included in our consolidated results of operations 
instead  they are recorded directly to stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced and sold 
to the extent the change in the fair value of the derivative exceeds the change in the expected cash flows from the forecasted production  the change is recorded in income in the period it occurs 
valuation of hedge positions 
in determining the amounts to be recorded  we are required to estimate the fair values of both the derivative and the associated hedged production at its physical location 
where necessary  we adjust nymex prices to other regional delivery points using our own estimates of future regional prices 
our estimates are based upon various factors that include closing prices on the nymex  over the counter quotations  volatility and the time value of options 
the calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts  regional price differences and interest rates 
we periodically validate our valuations using independent third parties quotations 
new accounting standards in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement changes the method of accounting for costs associated with the retirement of long lived assets eg oil gas production facilities  etc 
that we are obligated to incur 
the statement requires that the fair value of the obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made  and that the asset retirement cost be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the associated asset 
under our previous accounting method  we recognized the cost to abandon our oil and gas properties over their productive lives on a unit of production basis 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  a pre tax cumulative effect gain of approximately million will be reported in our consolidated statement of income on january  we will also report an increase in our assets of approximately million and an increase in our liabilities of approximately million 
there will be no impact on our reported cash flows as a result of adopting sfas no 
in the second quarter of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 recision of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections as of april this statement provides guidance for income statement classifications of gains and losses on extinguishment of debt and accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
our adoption of sfas no 
on january  had no effect on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  our adoption of sfas on january  had no effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of accounting for entities that elect to transition from the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation to the fair value method 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of this statement in our year end financial statements 
we continue to apply the intrinsic value method of accounting for our stock based compensation plans 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value  which is different from the current practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable  as those terms are defined in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin has a dual effective date 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in the interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we do not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a material effect on our financial statements 
see note  debt gas sales obligation  to our consolidated financial statements  regarding the guarantee associated with the gas sales obligation 
in january  the fasb issued fin consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights these entities are referred to as variable interest entities or vies and how to determine if business enterprise should consolidate the vie 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that all enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures regarding their relationship with the vie 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fin no 
on our financial statements  however we do not believe that we have any vies that will require consolidation in our financial statements under this interpretation 
regulation we are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
exploration  development  production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulation 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties  and taxation 
under these laws  we could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages 
failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs 
any such liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
federal regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas 
historically  the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to several laws enacted by congress and the regulations promulgated under these laws by the ferc 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which gas could be sold 
congress removed all price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  congress could  however  reenact price controls in the future 
our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability  terms and cost of transportation 
the price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
from to the present  several major regulatory changes have been implemented by congress and the ferc that affect the economics of natural gas production  transportation and sales 
in addition  the ferc is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry  most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies  that remain subject to the ferc s jurisdiction 
these initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of gas under certain circumstances 
the stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and these initiatives generally reflect more light handed regulation 
the ultimate impact of the complex rules and regulations issued by the ferc since cannot be predicted 
in addition  many aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial and ferc final decisions 
we cannot predict what further action the ferc will take on these matters 
some of the ferc s more recent proposals may  however  adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines 
we do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
the outer continental shelf lands act  or ocsla  requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf  or the shelf  provide open access  non discriminatory service 
historically  the ferc has opted not to impose regulatory requirements under its ocsla authority on gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its natural gas act jurisdiction 
however  the ferc has issued order no 
 requiring that virtually all non proprietary pipeline transporters of natural gas on the shelf report information on their affiliations  rates and conditions of service 
these reporting requirements apply  in certain circumstances  to operators of production platforms and other facilities on the shelf with respect to gas movements across such facilities 
in a recent decision  the us district court for the district of columbia permanently enjoined the ferc from enforcing order no 
 on the basis that the ferc did not possess the requisite rule making authority under the ocsla for issuing order no 
the ferc s appeal of the court s decision is pending in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
we cannot predict the outcome of this appeal  nor can we predict what further action the ferc will take with respect to this matter 
in addition  the ferc retains authority under ocsla to exercise jurisdiction over entities outside the reach of its natural gas act jurisdiction if necessary to ensure non discriminatory access to service on the shelf 
we do not believe that any ferc action taken under ocsla will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers  gatherers and marketers with which we compete 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before congress  the ferc and the courts 
the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated  therefore  there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently pursued by the ferc and congress will continue 
federal regulation of sales and transportation of crude oil 
our sales of crude oil and condensate are currently not regulated and are made at market prices 
in a number of instances  however  the ability to transport and sell such products are dependent on pipelines whose rates  terms and conditions of service are subject to ferc jurisdiction under the interstate commerce act 
certain regulations implemented by the ferc in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines 
however  we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other natural gas producers 
federal leases 
the majority of our us operations are located on federal oil and gas leases  which are administered by the mms 
these leases are issued through competitive bidding  contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed mms regulations and orders pursuant to ocsla which are subject to change by the mms 
for offshore operations  lessees must obtain mms approval for exploration plans and development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations 
in addition to permits required from other agencies such as the coast guard  the army corps of engineers and the environmental protection agency  lessees must obtain a permit from the mms prior to the commencement of drilling 
the mms has promulgated regulations requiring offshore production facilities located on the shelf to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications 
the mms also has regulations restricting the flaring or venting of natural gas  and has proposed to amend such regulations to prohibit the flaring of liquid hydrocarbons and oil without prior authorization 
similarly  the mms has promulgated other regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the removal of all production facilities 
to cover the various obligations of lessees on the shelf  the mms generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met 
the cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and there is no assurance that bonds or other surety can be obtained in all cases 
we are currently exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements of the mms 
under certain circumstances  the mms may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the mms has issued a final rule that governs the calculation of royalties and the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases 
this rule provides that the mms will collect royalties based upon the market value of oil produced from federal leases 
the lawfulness of the new rule has been challenged in federal court 
we cannot predict what action the mms will take on this matter 
we believe that these rules will not have a material effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
state and local regulation of drilling and production 
we own interests in properties located onshore louisiana  texas  new mexico and oklahoma 
we also own interests in properties in the state waters offshore texas and louisiana 
these states regulate drilling and operating activities by requiring  among other things  permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells  and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilling and the plugging and abandonment of wells 
the laws of these states also govern a number of environmental and conservation matters  including the handling and disposing of waste materials  the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells which may be drilled  unitization and pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells 
some states prorate production to the market demand for oil and gas 
environmental regulations 
our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the obligation to perform investigatory or remedial activities or the imposition of injunctive relief 
environmental laws and regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
both onshore and offshore drilling in certain areas has been opposed by environmental groups and  in certain areas  has been restricted 
to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts onshore or offshore drilling or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general  our business and prospects could be adversely affected 
the oil pollution act of  or opa  imposes regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from spills in us waters 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility  vessel or pipeline  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
opa assigns strict  joint and several liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages 
while liability limits apply in some circumstances  a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operating regulation  or if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup 
even if applicable  the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs  plus up to million in other damages for offshore facilities and up to million for onshore facilities 
few defenses exist to the liability imposed by opa 
failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party to administrative  civil or criminal enforcement actions 
opa also requires operators in the gulf of mexico to demonstrate to the mms that they possess available financial resources that are sufficient to pay for certain costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill 
under opa and mms regulations  responsible parties are required to demonstrate that they possess financial resources sufficient to pay for environmental cleanup and restoration costs of at least million for an oil spill in state waters and at least million for an oil spill in federal waters 
since we currently have extensive operations in federal waters  we currently provide a total of million in financial assurance to mms 
this million in financial assurance is provided through million in guaranteed net worth and million in insurance 
in addition to opa  our discharges to waters of the us are further limited by the federal clean water act  or cwa  and analogous state laws 
cwa prohibits any discharge into waters of the united states except in compliance with permits issued by federal and state governmental agencies 
failure to comply with cwa  including discharge limits on permits issued pursuant to cwa  may also result in administrative  civil or criminal enforcement actions 
opa and cwa also require the preparation of oil spill response plans 
ocsla authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the shelf 
specific design and operational standards may apply to vessels  rigs  platforms  vehicles and structures operating or located on the shelf 
violations of lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to ocsla can result in substantial administrative  civil and criminal penalties  as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases 
the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  generally regulates the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
although rcra specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids  produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  development or production of crude oil  natural gas or geothermal energy  legislation has been proposed in congress from time to time that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as hazardous wastes  which would make the reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling  disposal and clean up requirements 
if such legislation were to be enacted  it could increase our operating costs  as well as those of the oil and gas industry in general 
moreover  ordinary industrial wastes  such as paint wastes  waste solvents  laboratory wastes and waste oils  may be regulated as hazardous waste 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  also known as the superfund law  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under the superfund law may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
we currently own or lease onshore properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas for a number of years 
many of these onshore properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control 
these properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to the superfund law  rcra and analogous state laws  and we potentially could be required to investigate and remediate such properties 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable us federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
our foreign operations are potentially subject to similar governmental controls and restrictions relating to the environment 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with any such foreign requirements pertaining to the environment 
there can be no assurance  however  that current regulatory requirements will not change  currently unforeseen environmental incidents will not occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations will not be discovered 
other factors affecting our business and financial results oil and gas prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas 
these prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our credit facility is subject to periodic redeterminations based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce 
among the factors that can cause fluctuations are the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price and availability of alternative fuels  weather conditions  the level of consumer demand  the price of foreign imports  world wide economic conditions  political conditions in oil and gas producing regions  and domestic and foreign governmental regulations 
our use of oil and gas price hedging contracts involves credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our net income 
we use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines  their use may also limit future revenues from price increases 
hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations 
our future success depends on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
as is generally the case  our producing properties in the gulf of mexico and the onshore gulf coast often have high initial production rates  followed by steep declines 
to maintain production levels  we must locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those depleted by production 
without successful exploration or acquisition activities  our reserves  production and revenues will decline rapidly 
we may be able to find and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost 
in addition  substantial capital is required to replace and grow reserves 
if lower oil and gas prices or operating difficulties result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected or limit our ability to borrow under our credit arrangements  we may be unable to expend the capital necessary to locate and develop or acquire new oil and gas reserves 
actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves and future cash flows from those reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
estimating accumulations of oil and gas is complex 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysic  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the proved reserve information set forth in this report is based on estimates we prepared 
estimates prepared by others might differ materially from our estimates 
actual quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves  future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development and prevailing oil and gas prices 
our reserves may also be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
if oil and gas prices decrease  we may be required to take writedowns 
we may be required to writedown the carrying value of our oil and gas properties when oil and gas prices are low or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves  increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our exploration results 
we capitalize the costs to acquire  find and develop our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting method 
the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  using period end oil and gas prices and a discount factor  plus the lower of cost or fair market value for unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
we review the carrying value of our properties quarterly  based on prices in effect including the value of our hedge positions as of the end of each quarter or as of the time of reporting our results 
the carrying value of oil and gas properties is computed on a country by country basis 
therefore  while our properties in one country may be subject to a writedown  our properties in other countries could be unaffected 
once incurred  a writedown of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices increase 
we may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors  including recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs  and potential environmental and other liabilities 
the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain 
in connection with these assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices 
our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
inspections may not always be performed on every platform or well  and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems 
we often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an as is basis 
competitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations 
competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and proved undeveloped acreage 
major and independent oil and gas companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties  as well as for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop their properties 
many of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours  which may adversely affect our ability to compete with these companies 
drilling is a high risk activity 
our future success will depend on the success of our drilling program 
in addition to the numerous operating risks described in more detail below  these activities involve the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and producing wells 
furthermore  our drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
the oil and gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses  insurance may not protect us against all these risks 
these risks include fires  explosions  blow outs  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas  formation water or drilling fluids  natural disasters  pipe or cement failures  casing collapses  embedded oilfield drilling and service tools  abnormally pressured formations  and environmental hazards such as oil spills  natural gas leaks  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these events occur  we could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  severe damage or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  investigatory and clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  suspension of our operations  and repairs to resume operations 
if we experience any of these problems  our ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected 
offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment  such as capsizing  collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions 
these conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
as a result  we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for our exploration and development programs and acquisitions  or result in loss of properties 
we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these potential risks and losses 
we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  it could adversely affect us 
we have risks associated with our foreign operations 
we currently have international activities and we continue to evaluate and pursue new opportunities for international expansion in select areas 
ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the united states is subject to the various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of expropriation  nationalization  war or insurrection  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities and quasi governmental agencies  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  labor problems  and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations 
our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment 
in addition  if a dispute arises with respect to our foreign operations  we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states 
exploration in deepwater involves greater operating and financial risks than exploration at shallower depths 
these risks could result in substantial losses 
deepwater drilling and operations require the application of recently developed technologies and involve a higher risk of mechanical failure 
we will likely experience significantly higher drilling costs for any deepwater wells that we drill 
in addition  much of the deepwater play lacks the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters 
as a result  development of a deepwater discovery may be a lengthy process and require substantial capital investment  resulting in significant financial and operating risks 
in addition  as we carry out our drilling program is deepwater  it is likely that we will not initially serve as operator of the wells 
as a result  we may have limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties or their associated costs 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these deepwater projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities in the deepwater of the gulf of mexico 
the success and timing of drilling and exploitation activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control  including the timing and amount of capital expenditures  the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs  drilling equipment  support vessels  production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel  the operator s expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants in drilling wells  and selection of technology 
other independent oil and gas companies limited access to capital may change our exploration and development plans 
many independent oil and gas companies have limited access to the capital necessary to finance their activities 
as a result  some of the other working interest owners of our wells may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due 
these problems could cause us to change  suspend or terminate our drilling and development plans with respect to the affected project 
forward looking information this report contains information that is forward looking or relates to anticipated future events or results such as planned capital expenditures  the availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures  estimates of proved reserves and the estimated present value of such reserves  wells planned to be drilled in the future  our financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in this information are reasonable  this information is based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties 
actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors  including drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions  the prices of goods and services  the availability of drilling rigs and other support services the availability of capital resources and other factors affecting our business described above under the captions regulation and other factors affecting our business 
all written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors

proved developed producing reserves 
proved developed reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals currently open in existing wells and capable of production to market 
proved developed reserves 
proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved developed nonproducing reserves

proved reserves 
the estimated quantities of crude oil or natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved undeveloped reserves 
proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
shelf 
the us outer continental shelf of the gulf of mexico 
water depths generally range from feet to  feet 
tcfe 
one trillion cubic feet equivalent  determined using the ratio of six mcf gas to one bbl of crude oil or condensate 
undeveloped acreage 
lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves 
working interest 
the operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill  produce and conduct operating activities on the property and a share of production

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
oil and gas prices we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next months as part of our risk management program 
we use hedging to reduce price volatility  help ensure that we have adequate cash flow to fund our capital programs and manage price risks and return on some of our acquisitions 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions 
while hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
for a further discussion of our hedging activities  see the information under the caption hedging in item of this report 
interest rates at december   we had approximately million in long term fixed rate debt 
this debt was comprised of million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due  million of senior subordinated notes due  and million of secured notes with an interest rate of 
additionally  we had million of convertible trust preferred securities bearing a fixed distribution rate of 
at december   we also had million remaining on a gas sales obligation that we assumed with the purchase of eex 
payment under this obligation is amortized on the interest method using an interest rate of 
our year end variable rate debt consisted of million borrowed under our bank revolving credit facility and million borrowed under our money market lines of credit 
the interest rate at december  for our libor based loans under our credit facility was and the interest rate for the money market lines was 
we considered our interest rate exposure at year end to be minimal because the majority  about  of our long term debt obligations were at fixed rates 
the impact on annual cash flow of a change in the floating rate applicable to our variable rate debt would be million 
at december   we had no open interest rate hedge positions to affect our exposure to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rates our cash flow from certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies 
we consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements  based on net cash flows  to be immaterial 
we did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at december
