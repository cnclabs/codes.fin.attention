due to rapid changes and increasing complexities in information technology  we believe outsourcing is an efficient solution for many businesses and continues to be a growing trend 
we have grown through strategic acquisitions as well as organic growth 
on february   we completed the acquisition of amquest  inc  an atlanta based it outsourcing company  for approximately million in cash after certain post closing adjustments the amquest acquisition 
this acquisition combined two highly complementary businesses and enabled us to benefit from increased scale  enhanced services  and expanded geographic reach 
the combination strengthens our position as one of the leading providers of it outsourcing solutions for large and mid size companies enterprises across a broad range of industries including financial services  security  publishing  healthcare  telecommunications and manufacturing 
the amquest acquisition was recorded as a purchase in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb  statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  which requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
sfas requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we applied sfas beginning in the first quarter of and accordingly have not recorded goodwill amortization in we tested goodwill for impairment using processes described in sfas  and have no impairment to record in on september   we changed our year ending date from october st to december st 
this change required the preparation of financial statements for the two month period ended december  financial statements for the fiscal year ended october  and prior are not restated to conform to the calendar year reporting period of year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december  the current year  revenues increased  to  from  for the year ended december  the prior year 
revenues from amquest contributed  of this increase 
revenues grew by  excluding growth contributed by amquest 
this organic revenue growth is primarily attributable to a significant new it managed services contract  signed in  with an initial term of four years 
unless the customer provides notice of non renewal  the contract will renew annually for three annual years 
revenues from this significant customer were  in the prior year compared with  in the current year  representing and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increase in revenue from this customer reflects a higher level of service provided in the current year 
operating costs increased  to  during the current year compared with  for the prior year 
with the additional operating costs of amquest excluded  operating costs declined by  
the reduced level of operating costs reflects the actions we took in to minimize costs through staff reductions 
in addition  in we suspended operations at our metropolitan atlanta data center and the further development of the northern virginia data center 
operating costs as a percentage of revenues decreased to in the current year from in the prior year 
operating costs in the current year reflect the benefit from the settlement with a software licensor described below 
in april  we renegotiated the lease of our metropolitan atlanta data center 
the renegotiated lease  which is payable through december  reduces the leased space by more than  square feet and increases the base rent by per square foot  to an annual base rent of  the base rent is subject to future escalations of approximately per lease year 
in addition  we are responsible for a pro rata share of the building s operating expenses and real estate taxes 
the total estimated savings under the renegotiated lease approximate million over the remaining term of the lease 
included in operating costs in the current and prior years are expenses for this facility of  and  respectively 
during  we relocated most of the operations of amquest to the metropolitan atlanta data center 
also in may  we reached an agreement with the landlord of the northern virginia data center 
the agreement releases us from the future payments under the lease  which amounted to approximately million through november the agreement also required a cash payment of approximately  and the forfeiture of a  deposit 
as of december   we recorded a provision of  for this expected result  including the write off of approximately  of construction in progress costs 
during  approximately  of the provision relating to estimated settlement costs was reversed 
included in operating costs in the current year and prior year are costs for this facility of  and  respectively 
in january  we settled a dispute of certain claims with a software licensor 
pursuant to the settlement  we received credits totaling  to be used toward certain future purchases the credits 
the entire value of the credits has been recorded in the current year  and as of december   all the credits have been applied against certain software license fees 
additionally  we reversed accrued expenses of  for software support and maintenance fees in the current year in connection with the settlement of the dispute 
selling and promotion costs decreased  to  for the current year from  for the prior year 
selling and promotion costs as a percentage of revenues decreased to from in the prior year  due to decreased costs and increased revenues 
general and administrative expenses decreased  to  for the current year from  for the prior year 
with the effect of amquest excluded  general and administrative expenses declined   reflecting in large part the cost savings initiatives and staff reductions commenced in amortization related to a restricted stock award to a former executive was  in the prior year 
the former executive resigned in november  and the remaining unamortized balance of the award was written off at that time 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
in the prior year  goodwill amortization was  other depreciation and amortization for fixed assets and other intangibles rose   to  for the current year from  for the prior year 
without the effect of amquest  other depreciation and amortization increased   primarily as a result of fixed asset purchases since december  we recorded net interest expense of  in the current year  compared with net interest income of  in the prior year 
the net change of  reflects a decrease in interest income of  from a lower average balance of interest earning assets during the current year 
also  to a lesser extent  the decrease in interest income results from lower interest rates 
the net change also includes an increase of  in interest expense on a larger average outstanding debt balance than in the prior year 
in february  we issued  of senior subordinated debentures in connection with the amquest acquisition  bearing interest at an effective rate of 
amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of the debt discount also contributed to the increased interest expense in the current year 
in the current year  we recorded an income tax benefit representing the carryback of  of federal income tax credits net of income tax expense of  representing estimated state income taxes 
tax expense of  was recorded in the prior year  representing the reconciliation between the estimated benefits reported in the period ended december  and the amount recognized in our income tax return 
the cumulative tax benefit we recorded prior to december  was limited to the refund of taxes paid in prior years that were received as a result of carrying back a portion of its pre tax loss 
cumulative pre tax losses that cannot be carried back can be carried forward for a period of taxable years for federal income tax purposes 
we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in the deferred tax asset associated with carrying forward cumulative pre tax losses has been fully offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realizing such tax benefits 
we have net income of  for the current year versus a net loss of  for the prior year 
net loss to common stockholders after accretion and accrued dividends on preferred stock was  for the current year compared with a net loss of  in the prior year 
the net loss to common stockholders included an increase in non cash charges for accretion and accrued dividends on preferred stock of  to  in the current year from  in the prior year 
the loss per common share was for the current year compared with a loss per common share of in the prior year  on both a basic and diluted basis 
common stock equivalents were ignored in determining the net loss per share for both periods  since the inclusion of such equivalents would be anti dilutive 
year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the financial statements included in this annual report on form k do not include financial statements for the year ended december  for the purposes of this management s discussion and analysis  the following table presents our results for the year ended december  in comparison with the comparable unaudited results for the year ended december  year ended december  unaudited revenues   costs and expenses operating costs   selling and promotion costs   general and administrative expenses   leased facilities and office closings   amortization of restricted stock award   amortization of goodwill   other depreciation and amortization   total costs and expenses   loss from operations   net interest income   pretax loss   income tax provision benefit   net loss   accretion and dividends on redeemable preferred stock   net loss to common stockholders   for the calendar year ended december  calendar  revenues increased  to  from  for the calendar year ended december  unaudited calendar 
revenues from a significant new customer contributed to the increase

operating costs increased  to  during calendar compared with  in calendar the increases primarily consist of idc and related managed services operating and development costs mostly occurring earlier in calendar due to excess supply of server hosting space  we have taken steps to minimize costs by suspending the operations at the metropolitan atlanta data center and idc and the further development of the northern virginia idc

in june  we hired a chief executive officer the executive who served until november the employment agreement with the executive provided for an award of  restricted shares of common stock 
the value of the  restricted shares   on the date of grant  was being amortized ratably over a four year vesting schedule 
effective november   the executive resigned and entered into a settlement agreement with us to terminate the employment contract 
as part of the settlement  we accelerated the vesting of the stock award resulting in a nonrecurring  noncash charge of approximately  total amortization related to the restricted shares in calendar was  in calendar we amortized  of the restricted stock award 
other depreciation and amortization for fixed assets and other intangibles rose   to  for the calendar from  for the calendar the increase is primarily the result of fixed asset purchases during and we recorded net interest income of  in calendar  compared with net interest income of  in calendar the net reduction of  reflects a decrease in interest income of  from a lower average balance of interest earning assets during calendar and lower interest rates 
the reduction in interest income was partially offset by a decrease of  in interest expense arising from a larger average outstanding debt and capital lease obligation balance in calendar in calendar  we recorded income tax expense of  representing the difference between the estimated benefit as previously reported and the amount recognized in our income tax return 
a tax benefit of  was recorded in calendar based on an estimate of the availability of carrying back the pre tax loss for such period to a prior taxable year 
the cumulative tax benefit we recorded was limited to the refund of taxes paid in prior years that were received as a result of carrying back a portion of its pre tax loss 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes that begin to expire in the deferred tax asset associated with carrying forward cumulative pre tax losses has been fully offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realizing such tax benefits 
our net loss in calendar increased  to  from  in calendar reflecting an increase of  in total costs and expenses  largely due to a  loss on leased facilities and an increase of  in amortization for the restricted stock award on which the amortization was accelerated 
net loss to common stockholders after accretion and accrued dividends on preferred stock was  for calendar and  for calendar in addition to the increased loss related to the nonrecurring  noncash charge for the restricted stock award  the net loss to common stockholders included an increase in the year in noncash charges for accretion and accrued dividends on preferred stock of  which increased to  in calendar from  in calendar the loss per common share was for calendar compared with a loss per common share of in calendar  on both a basic and diluted basis

this transaction and the related issuance of debentures are more fully described below 
additional uses of cash in investing activities included  for the purchase of property and equipment  excluding  that was acquired pursuant to capital leases

principal financing activities included proceeds of  from the issuance of debentures more fully described below 
cash used in financing activities included  in payments of principal with respect to debt and capital lease obligations 
on february   in connection with the acquisition of amquest  we entered into a securities purchase agreement the spa with a group of private investors the investors whereby we issued senior subordinated debentures the debentures and warrants to purchase  initially   shares of our common stock the initial warrants subject to adjustments as discussed below in exchange for  pursuant to the spa  the proceeds from the sale of the debentures were used to fund a portion of the cost of the acquisition of amquest 
the debentures were issued at an aggregate face value of  with a maturity of three years from february  the issuance date  with the right to extend the term of the debentures for one additional year at our sole option 
pursuant to the terms of the debentures  we are required to make semi annual interest payments of per annum for the first two years  per annum for the period commencing on february  and ending on february   and if we elect to extend the maturity date for one year  per annum from february  we have the option to pay interest in the form of a cash  b additional debentures  or c a combination of cash and additional debentures 
if we choose to make interest payments using additional debentures  we may be required to issue additional warrants the additional warrants pursuant to the terms of the debentures 
additional warrants will not be subject to cancellation 
the fair market value of additional warrants issued  if any  will be recorded as deferred financing costs and amortized over the remaining term of the debentures 
the initial warrants have been issued pursuant to a warrant agreement and are subject to certain customary anti dilution adjustments  including adjustments that increase the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants in certain events where we issue shares of common stock or securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of our common stock at an effective purchase price of less than the exercise price of the warrants then in effect 
the exercise price of the initial warrants is 
the warrants expire if unexercised by january  and may be cancelled upon the prepayment of the debentures  as more fully described in the warrant agreement 
on july  and january   we made the interest payments then due by issuing additional debentures totaling  and  respectively 
the additional debentures are subject to the same interest rates and other terms as the original debentures 
if the debentures remain unpaid at february   we will be required to issue additional warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
another measure of a company s ability to generate cash from its operations is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda 
for the year ended december   our ebitda was  compared to an ebitda loss of  in the prior year 
ebitda for the current year includes  related to the settlement of a dispute with a software licensor  as previously described 
moreover  the significant improvement in ebitda reflects organic revenue growth combined with the cost savings and the contribution of amquest to our operations 
the following table reconciles ebitda to net income for the current and prior year 
reconciliation in thousands year ended december  net income loss   add back deduct tax expense benefit interest expense income  depreciation and amortization   amortization of restricted stock award  ebitda   in april we renegotiated the lease of our data center in metropolitan atlanta 
the renegotiated lease  which is payable through december  reduces the leased space by more than  square feet and increases the base rent by per square foot  to an annual base rent of  the base rent is subject to future escalations of approximately per lease year 
in addition  we are responsible for a pro rata share of the building s operating expenses and real estate taxes 
the total estimated savings under the renegotiated lease approximate million over the remaining term of the lease 
during  we relocated most of the operations of amquest to the metropolitan atlanta data center 
also  in may we reached an agreement with the landlord to terminate the lease of our partially developed data center in northern virginia 
in the prior year  costs associated with the northern virginia data center were  as of december   we had cash and equivalents of  we expect that our operating activities will continue to generate cash 
we believe that our cash  current assets  and cash generated from future operating activities will provide adequate resources to fund our ongoing operating requirements for the next months 
we would need to obtain additional financing to fund any significant acquisitions or other substantial investments 
ebitda ebitda is defined as earnings before income taxes  depreciation  amortization  amortization of a restricted stock award  interest and  when applicable  restructuring costs  impairment of assets  and other income and expenses 
the issuance of purchase credits by a software licensor in connection with the settlement of a dispute and leased facilities and office closing costs have been treated as operating items and are included in ebitda 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income  as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  as an indicator of our operating performance  or to cash flows  as a measure of liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u 
s  which require the selection and application of significant accounting policies  and which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting polices 
revenue recognition the majority of revenues are invoiced on a monthly recurring basis under long term contracts  typically ranging from one to five years in length  providing for either fixed monthly fees or time and material billings 
revenue is recognized under these contracts when we process the agreed upon transactions in accordance with the contractual performance standards  or perform the services  and collection is reasonably assured 
application of these standards can involve management s judgments  including judgment as to the collection of invoiced amounts 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
tangible and intangible assets we have significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet  primarily property and equipment  deferred software costs  and intangible assets  primarily goodwill  related to acquisitions 
the assignment of useful lives to these assets and the valuation and classification of intangible assets involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these tangible and intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions 
our assets are tested and reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis under the established accounting guidelines 
changes in business conditions or changes in the decisions of management as to how assets will be deployed in our operations could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations 
new financial accounting standards in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

the provisions of sfas are to be adopted prospectively after december  although sfas may impact the accounting for costs related to exit or disposal activities we may enter into in the future  particularly the timing of the recognition of these costs  the adoption of the statement did not have an impact on our current financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no
