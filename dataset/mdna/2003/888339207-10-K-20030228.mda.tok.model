part i item business general 
titanium metals corporation timet or the company was originally formed in and was incorporated in delaware in timet is one of the world s leading producers of titanium sponge and titanium melted and mill products 
the company is the only producer with major titanium production facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium 
the company estimates that in it accounted for approximately of worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products  down from in this decrease is primarily attributable to the company s significant reliance on sales to the commercial aerospace market  a market that the company estimates to have decreased by over from the company also estimates it accounted for approximately of worldwide titanium sponge production in titanium was first manufactured for commercial use in the s 
titanium s unique combination of corrosion resistance  elevated temperature performance and high strength to weight ratio makes it particularly desirable for use in commercial and military aerospace applications in which these qualities are essential design requirements for certain critical parts such as wing supports and jet engine components 
while aerospace applications have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the worldwide demand for titanium and were approximately of aggregate mill product shipments in  the number of non aerospace end use markets for titanium has expanded substantially 
today  numerous industrial uses for titanium exist  including chemical and industrial power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
demand for titanium is also increasing in emerging markets with such diverse uses as offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor  automotive and architectural applications 
timet s products include titanium sponge  melted products and mill products 
the titanium industry is comprised of several manufacturers that  like timet  produce a relatively complete range of titanium products and a significant number of producers worldwide that manufacture a limited range of titanium mill products 
the company is currently the only major us titanium sponge producer 
the company s long term strategy is to maximize the value of its core aerospace business and develop new markets  applications and products to help reduce its traditional dependence on the aerospace industry 
in the near term  the company is focused on reducing its cost structure  reducing inventories  improving the quality of its products and processes and taking other actions to generate positive cash flow and return to profitability 
industry 
the titanium industry historically has derived a substantial portion of its business from the aerospace industry 
mill product shipments to the aerospace industry in represented about of total worldwide mill product shipment volume 
aerospace demand for titanium products  which includes both jet engine components ie blades  discs  rings and engine cases and air frame components ie bulkheads  tail sections  landing gear  wing supports and fasteners can be broken down into commercial and military sectors 
the commercial aerospace sector has a significant influence on titanium companies  particularly mill product producers such as timet 
in  the commercial aerospace sector accounted for mill product shipments of approximately  metric tons  which represent approximately of aerospace mill product shipments and of aggregate mill product shipments 
mill product shipments to military aerospace markets in were approximately  metric tons  a increase from military aerospace mill product shipments 
military aerospace shipments approximated of aggregate mill product shipments in  up from in military aerospace shipments are largely driven by government defense spending in north america and europe 
as discussed further below  new aircraft programs generally are in development for several years  followed by multi year procurement contracts 
the company s business is more dependent on aerospace demand than the overall titanium industry  as approximately of the company s annual mill product shipment volume in was to the aerospace sector commercial aerospace and military aerospace 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal driver of the historical fluctuations in the performance of titanium companies 
over the past years  the titanium industry had cyclical peaks in mill product shipments in  and and cyclical lows in  and demand for titanium reached its highest peak in when industry mill product shipments reached an estimated  metric tons 
industry mill product shipments subsequently declined approximately to an estimated  metric tons in after falling from levels to  metric tons in and  industry shipments climbed to  metric tons in however  primarily due to a decrease in demand for titanium from the commercial aerospace sector  total industry mill product shipments fell approximately to an estimated  metric tons in the company expects total industry mill product shipments in will decrease slightly from levels 
the economic slowdown in the united states and other regions of the world in the latter part of and the september  terrorist attacks combined to negatively impact commercial air travel in the united states and abroad throughout although airline passenger traffic showed improvement in the months immediately following the terrorist attacks  current data indicates that traffic remains below pre attack levels 
as a result  the us airline industry is expected to record a second consecutive year of losses and two major us airlines were forced to seek bankruptcy protection from their creditors 
airlines have announced a number of actions to reduce both costs and capacity including  but not limited to  the early retirement of airplanes  the deferral of scheduled deliveries of new aircraft and allowing purchase options to expire 
the company expects the current slowdown in the commercial aerospace sector to continue through before beginning a modest upturn in the company believes that industry mill product shipments to the commercial aerospace sector could decline by up to in  primarily due to a combination of reduced aircraft production rates and excess inventory accumulated throughout the commercial aerospace supply chain since september  the commercial aerospace supply chain is fragmented and decentralized  making it difficult to quantify excess inventories  and while the company estimates there was a significant reduction in excess inventory throughout the supply chain during  it still may take from one to two years for the remainder of such excess inventory to be substantially absorbed  barring the impact of terrorist activities or global conflicts 
according to the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  the worldwide commercial airline industry reported an estimated operating loss of approximately billion in  compared with an operating loss of billion in and operating income of billion in the airline monitor traditionally issues forecasts for commercial aircraft deliveries each january and july 
according to the airline monitor  large commercial aircraft deliveries for the to period peaked in with aircraft  including wide body aircraft that use substantially more titanium than their narrow body counterparts 
large commercial aircraft deliveries totaled including wide bodies in the airline monitor s most recently issued forecast of january calls for deliveries in  deliveries in and deliveries in relative to  these forecasted delivery rates represent anticipated declines of about in  in and in after  the airline monitor calls for a continued increase each year in large commercial aircraft deliveries through  with forecasted deliveries of aircraft in exceeding levels 
deliveries of titanium generally precede aircraft deliveries by about one year  although this varies considerably by titanium product 
this correlates to the company s cycle  which historically precedes the cycle of the aircraft industry and related deliveries 
the company can give no assurance as to the extent or duration of the current commercial aerospace cycle or the extent to which it will affect demand for the company s products 
the aforementioned bankruptcy filings  although harmful to the commercial aerospace industry in the near term  could ultimately result in a more efficient and profitable commercial airline industry 
the renegotiation of union contracts and changes to work rules to bring labor costs in line with the current revenue environment  as well as simplifying fare structures in order to attract more travelers  may promote greater profitability for the commercial airline industry 
further  route restructuring  more point to point service and expanded customer options could also contribute to increased demand for commercial air travel 
on the other hand  future terrorist activities or global conflicts could result in a significant decrease in demand for commercial air travel and increase the financial troubles of the airline industry 
military aerospace programs were the first to utilize titanium s unique properties on a large scale  beginning in the s 
titanium shipments to military aerospace markets reached a peak in the s before falling to historical lows in the early s with the end of the cold war 
however  the importance of military markets to the titanium industry is expected to rise in coming years as defense spending budgets increase in reaction to terrorist activities or global conflicts 
it is estimated that overall titanium consumption will increase in this market segment in and beyond  but consumption by military applications will offset only a relatively small part of the decrease in the commercial aerospace sector 
several of today s active us military programs  including the c  f a  f and f began during the cold war and are forecast to continue at healthy production levels for the foreseeable future 
in addition to these established programs  new programs in the united states offer growth opportunities for increased titanium consumption 
the f a raptor is currently in low rate initial production  and us air force officials have expressed a need for a minimum of airplanes  but cost overruns and development delays may result in reduced procurement over the life of the program 
in october  lockheed martin was awarded what could eventually become the largest military contract ever for the f joint strike fighter jsf 
the jsf is expected to enter low rate initial production in late  and although no specific order and delivery patterns have been established  procurement is expected to extend over the next to years and include as many as  to  planes 
european military programs also have active aerospace programs offering the possibility for increased titanium consumption 
the saab gripen  eurofighter typhoon  dassault rafale and dassault mirage all have forecast increased production levels over the next decade 
since titanium s initial applications in the aerospace sector  the number of end use markets for titanium has significantly expanded 
established industrial uses for titanium include chemical plants  industrial power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
titanium continues to gain acceptance in many emerging market applications  including automotive  military armor  energy  architecture and consumer products 
although titanium is generally higher cost than other competing metals  in many cases customers find the physical properties of titanium to be attractive from the standpoint of weight  performance  design alternatives  life cycle value and other factors 
although emerging market demand presently represents only about of the total industry demand for titanium mill products  the company believes emerging market demand  in the aggregate  could grow at healthy double digit rates over the next several years 
the company is actively pursuing these markets 
although difficult to predict  the most attractive emerging segment appears to be automotive  due to its potential for sustainable long term growth 
for this reason  in timet established a new division  timet automotive  focused on the development of the automotive  truck and motorcycle markets 
the division is tasked with developing and marketing proprietary alloys and processes specifically suited for automotive applications and supporting supply chain activities for automotive manufacturers to most cost effectively engineer titanium components 
titanium is now used in several consumer car applications including the corvette z  toyota alteeza  infiniti q  volkswagen lupo fsi  honda s and mercedes s class and in numerous motorcycles 
at the present time  titanium is primarily used for exhaust systems  suspension springs and engine valves in consumer vehicles 
in exhaust systems  titanium provides for significant weight savings  while its corrosion resistance provides life of vehicle durability 
in suspension spring applications  titanium s low modulus of elasticity allows the spring s height to be reduced by to compared to a steel spring  which  when combined with the titanium s low density  permits to weight savings over steel spring suspension systems 
the lower spring height provides vehicle designers new styling alternatives and improved performance opportunities 
titanium suspension springs and exhaust applications are also attractive compared to alternative lightweight technologies because the titanium component can often be formed and fabricated on the same tooling used for the steel component it is typically replacing 
this is especially attractive for the rapidly growing niche vehicle market sectors that often seek the performance attributes that titanium provides  but where tooling costs prohibit alternative light weighting or other improved performance strategies 
titanium is also making inroads into other automotive applications  including turbo charger wheels  brake parts and connecting rods 
titanium engine components provide mass reduction benefits that directly improve vehicle performance and fuel economy 
in certain applications  titanium engine components can provide a cost effective alternative to engine balance shafts to address noise  vibration and harshness while simultaneously improving performance 
the decision to select titanium components for consumer car  truck and motorcycle components remains highly cost sensitive  however  the company believes titanium s acceptance in consumer vehicles will expand as the automotive industry continues to better understand the benefits it offers 
products and operations 
the company is a vertically integrated titanium manufacturer whose products include i titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  ii melted products ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements and iii mill products that are forged and rolled from ingot or slab  including long products billet and bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip  pipe and pipe fittings 
during the past three years  all of timet s sales revenue was generated by the company s integrated titanium operations its titanium melted and mill products segment  its only business segment 
business and geographic segment financial information is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
titanium sponge so called because of its appearance is the commercially pure  elemental form of titanium metal 
the first step in sponge production involves the chlorination of titanium containing rutile ores derived from beach sand with chlorine and coke to produce titanium tetrachloride 
titanium tetrachloride is purified and then reacted with magnesium in a closed system  producing titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as co products 
the company s titanium sponge production facility in henderson  nevada incorporates vacuum distillation process vdp technology  which removes the magnesium and magnesium chloride residues by applying heat to the sponge mass while maintaining a vacuum in the chamber 
the combination of heat and vacuum boils the residues from the sponge mass  and then the mass is mechanically pushed out of the condensing vessel  sheared and crushed  while the residual magnesium chloride is electrolytically separated and recycled 
titanium ingots and slabs are solid shapes cylindrical and rectangular  respectively that weigh up to metric tons in the case of ingots and up to metric tons in the case of slabs 
each ingot or slab is formed by melting titanium sponge  scrap or both  usually with various other alloying elements such as vanadium  aluminum  molybdenum  tin and zirconium 
titanium scrap is a by product of the forging  rolling  milling and machining operations  and significant quantities of scrap are generated in the production process for finished titanium products and components 
the melting process for ingots and slabs is closely controlled and monitored utilizing computer control systems to maintain product quality and consistency and to meet customer specifications 
in most cases  timet uses its ingots and slabs as the starting material for further processing into mill products 
however  it also sells ingots and slabs to third parties 
titanium mill products result from the forging  rolling  drawing  welding and or extrusion of titanium ingots or slabs into products of various sizes and grades 
these mill products include titanium billet  bar  rod  plate  sheet  strip  pipe and pipe fittings 
the company sends certain products to outside vendors for further processing before being shipped to customers or to the company s service centers 
many of the company s customers process the company s products for their ultimate end use or for sale to third parties 
during the production process and following the completion of manufacturing  the company performs extensive testing on its sponge  melted products and mill products 
testing may involve chemical analysis  mechanical testing  ultrasonic testing or x ray testing 
the inspection process is critical to ensuring that the company s products meet the high quality requirements of its customers  particularly in aerospace components production 
the company certifies its products meet customer specification at the time of shipment for substantially all customer orders 
the company is reliant on several outside processors to perform certain rolling  finishing and other processing steps in the us  and certain melting  forging and finishing steps in france 
in the us  one of the processors that performs these steps in relation to strip production and another as relates to plate finishing are owned by a competitor 
one of the processors as relates to extrusion is operated by a customer 
these processors are currently the primary source for these services 
other processors used in the us are not competitors 
in france  the processor is also a joint venture partner in the company s owned subsidiary  timet savoie  sa timet savoie 
although the company believes that there are other metal producers with the capability to perform these same processing functions  arranging for alternative processors  or possibly acquiring or installing comparable capabilities  could take several months or longer  and any interruption in these functions could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position and liquidity in the near term 
distribution 
the company sells its products through its own sales force based in the us and europe and through independent agents and distributors worldwide 
the company s marketing and distribution system also includes eight company owned service centers five in the us and three in europe  which sell the company s products on a just in time basis 
the service centers primarily sell value added and customized mill products including bar and flat rolled sheet and strip 
the company believes its service centers provide a competitive advantage because of their ability to foster customer relationships  customize products to suit specific customer requirements and respond quickly to customer needs 
raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the production of titanium ingot  slab and mill products are titanium sponge  titanium scrap and alloying elements 
during  approximately of the company s melted and mill product raw material requirements were fulfilled with internally produced sponge  with purchased sponge  with titanium scrap and with alloying elements 
the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge are titanium containing rutile ore  chlorine  magnesium and petroleum coke 
rutile ore is currently available from a limited number of suppliers around the world  principally located in australia  south africa  india and the united states 
a majority of the company s supply of rutile ore is currently purchased from australian suppliers 
the company believes the availability of rutile ore will be adequate for the foreseeable future and does not anticipate any interruptions of its rutile supplies  although political or economic instability in the countries from which the company purchases its rutile could materially and adversely affect availability 
although the company believes that the availability of rutile ore is adequate in the near term  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience interruptions 
chlorine is currently obtained from a single supplier near the company s sponge plant 
that supplier emerged from chapter bankruptcy reorganization in while the company does not presently anticipate any chlorine supply problems  there can be no assurances the chlorine supply will not be interrupted 
the company has taken steps to mitigate this risk  including establishing the feasibility of certain equipment modifications to enable it to utilize material from alternative chlorine suppliers or to purchase and utilize an intermediate product which will allow the company to eliminate the purchase of chlorine if needed 
magnesium and petroleum coke are generally available from a number of suppliers 
while the company was one of five major worldwide producers of titanium sponge in  it cannot supply all of its needs for all grades of titanium sponge internally and is dependent  therefore  on third parties for a substantial portion of its sponge requirements 
titanium mill and melted products require varying grades of sponge and or scrap depending on the customers specifications and expected end use 
in  allegheny technologies  inc idled its titanium sponge production facility  leaving timet as the only active major us producer of titanium sponge and reducing the number of major active worldwide producers to five 
presently  timet and certain suppliers in japan are the only producers of premium quality sponge required for more demanding aerospace applications 
however  two additional sponge suppliers are presently undergoing qualification tests of their products for premium quality applications and were qualified during by some engine manufacturers for certain premium quality applications 
this qualification process is likely to continue for several years 
historically  the company has purchased sponge predominantly from producers in japan and kazakhstan 
since  the company has also purchased sponge from the us defense logistics agency dla stockpile 
in september  the company entered into a new sponge supply agreement  effective from january  through december  this new agreement replaced and superceded a prior agreement 
the new agreement requires minimum annual purchases by the company of approximately million in through the company has no other long term sponge supply agreements 
in  the company expects to continue to purchase sponge from a variety of sources 
various alloying elements used in the production of titanium melted products are also available from a number of suppliers 
customer agreements 
the company has long term agreements ltas with certain major aerospace customers  including  but not limited to  the boeing company boeing  rolls royce plc rolls royce  united technologies corporation pratt whitney and related companies and wyman gordon company wyman gordon  a unit of precision castparts corporation pcc 
these agreements initially became effective in and and expire in through  subject to certain conditions 
the ltas generally provide for i minimum market shares of the customers titanium requirements or firm annual volume commitments and ii fixed or formula determined prices generally for at least the first five years 
generally  the ltas require the company s service and product performance to meet specified criteria and contain a number of other terms and conditions customary in transactions of these types 
in certain events of nonperformance by the company  the ltas may be terminated early 
additionally  under a group of related ltas which group represented approximately of the company s sales revenue which currently have fixed prices that convert to formula derived prices in  the customer may terminate the agreement as of the end of if the effect of the initiation of formula derived pricing would cause such customer material harm 
if any of such agreements within the group were to be terminated by the customer on this basis  it is possible that some portion of the business represented by that group of related ltas would continue on a non lta basis 
however  the termination of one or more of the ltas  including any of those within the group of related ltas  could result in a material and adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
the ltas were designed to limit selling price volatility to the customer  while providing timet with a committed base of volume throughout the aerospace business cycles 
they also  to varying degrees  effectively obligate timet to bear part of the risks of increases in raw material and other costs  but allow timet to benefit in part from decreases in such costs 
in april  the company reached a settlement of the litigation between timet and boeing related to the parties lta entered into in pursuant to the settlement  the company received a cash payment of million from boeing 
under the terms of the lta  as amended  in years through  boeing advances timet million annually less per pound of titanium product purchased by boeing subcontractors during the preceding year 
effectively  the company collects less from boeing than the lta selling price for each pound of titanium product sold directly to boeing and reduces the related customer advance recorded by the company 
for titanium products sold to boeing subcontractors  the company collects the full lta selling price  but gives boeing credit by reducing the next year s annual advance by per pound of titanium product sold to boeing subcontractors 
the boeing customer advance is also reduced as take or pay benefits are earned  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
under a separate agreement  timet must establish and hold buffer stock for boeing at timet s facilities  for which boeing will pay timet as such product is produced 
see item md a for additional information regarding the boeing lta 
the company also has an lta with valtimet sas valtimet  a manufacturer of welded stainless steel and titanium tubing that is principally sold into the industrial markets 
valtimet is a owned affiliate of timet 
the lta was entered into in and expires in under the lta  valtimet has agreed to purchase a certain percentage of its titanium requirements from timet at formula determined selling prices  subject to certain conditions 
certain provisions of this contract have been amended in the past and may be amended in the future to meet changing business conditions 
markets and customer base 
approximately of the company s sales revenue was generated by sales to customers within north america  as compared to about and in and  respectively 
approximately of the company s sales revenue was generated by sales to european customers  as compared to about and in and  respectively 
the balance of the company s sales was to other regions throughout the world 
further information regarding the company s external sales  net income  long lived assets and total assets by segment can be found in the company s consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements 
over of the company s sales revenue was generated by sales to the aerospace industry in  as compared to in each of and sales under the company s ltas accounted for over of its sales revenue in sales to pcc and its related entities approximated of the company s sales revenue in sales to rolls royce and other rolls royce suppliers under the rolls royce ltas including sales to certain of the pcc related entities represented approximately of the company s sales revenue in the company expects that while a majority of its sales revenue will be to the aerospace industry  other markets will continue to represent a significant portion of sales 
the primary market for titanium products in the commercial aerospace industry consists of two major manufacturers of large over seats commercial airframes boeing commercial airplanes group of the united states and airbus integrated company owned by european aeronautic defence and space company and owned by bae systems of europe airbus 
in addition to the airframe manufacturers  the following four manufacturers of large civil aircraft engines are also significant titanium users rolls royce  pratt whitney a unit of united technologies corporation  general electric aircraft engines and societe nationale d etude et de construction de moteurs d aviation snecma 
the company s sales are made both directly to these major manufacturers and to companies including forgers such as wyman gordon that use the company s titanium to produce parts and other materials for such manufacturers 
if any of the major aerospace manufacturers were to significantly reduce aircraft and or jet engine build rates from those currently expected  there could be a material adverse effect  both directly and indirectly  on the company 
as of december   the estimated firm order backlog for boeing and airbus  as reported by the airline monitor  was  planes  versus  planes at the end of and  planes at the end of the backlogs for boeing and airbus reflect orders for aircraft to be delivered over several years 
for example  the first deliveries of the airbus a are anticipated to begin in additionally  changes in the economic environment and the financial condition of airlines can result in rescheduling or cancellation of contractual orders 
accordingly  aircraft manufacturer backlogs are not necessarily a reliable indicator of near term business activity  but may be indicative of potential business levels over a longer term horizon 
the newer wide body planes  such as the boeing and the airbus a  a and a  tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their frames  engines and parts as measured by total flyweight than narrow body planes flyweight is the empty weight of a finished aircraft with engines but without fuel or passengers 
titanium represents approximately of the total flyweight of a boeing for example  compared to between to on the older  and models 
the estimated firm order backlog for wide body planes at year end was of total backlog compared to of total backlog at the end of at year end  a total of firm orders had been placed for the airbus a superjumbo jet  which program was officially launched in december with anticipated first deliveries in the company estimates that approximately metric tons of titanium will be purchased for each a manufactured  the most of any commercial aircraft 
outside of aerospace markets  the company manufactures a wide range of industrial products  including sheet  plate  tube  bar  billet and skelp  for customers in the chemical process  oil and gas  consumer  sporting goods  automotive  power generation and armor armament industries 
approximately of the company s sales revenue in  and was generated by sales into the industrial and emerging markets  including sales to valtimet for the production of condenser tubing 
for the oil and gas industries  the company provides seamless pipe for downhole casing  risers  tapered stress joints and other offshore oil production equipment  including fabrication of sub sea manifolds 
in armor and armament  the company sells plate products for fabrication into door hatches on fighting vehicles  as well as tank turret protection 
in addition to mill and melted products  which are sold into the aerospace  industrial and emerging markets  the company sells certain other products such as sponge  titanium tetrachloride and fabricated titanium assemblies 
sales of these other products represented of the company s sales revenue in and in each of and the company s backlog of unfilled orders was approximately million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  substantially all the year end backlog is scheduled for shipment during however  the company s order backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business activity 
since september   the company has received a number of deferrals and cancellations of previously scheduled orders and believes such requests will continue into through various strategic relationships  the company seeks to gain access to unique process technologies for the manufacture of its products and to expand existing markets and create and develop new markets for titanium 
the company has explored and will continue to explore strategic arrangements in the areas of product development  production and distribution 
the company also will continue to work with existing and potential customers to identify and develop new or improved applications for titanium that take advantage of its unique qualities 
competition 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis 
producers of melted and mill products are located primarily in the united states  japan  france  germany  italy  russia  china and the united kingdom 
there are currently five major producers of titanium sponge in the world 
timet is currently the only active major us sponge producer 
the company s principal competitors in the aerospace market are allegheny technologies inc and rti international metals  inc  both based in the united states  and verkhnaya salda metallurgical production organization vsmpo  based in russia 
these companies  along with the japanese producers and other companies  are also principal competitors in industrial markets 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  quality of products  technical support and the availability of products to meet customers delivery schedules 
in the us market  the increasing presence of us participants has become a significant competitive factor 
until  imports of foreign titanium products into the us had not been significant 
this was primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates and  with respect to japan  russia  kazakhstan and ukraine  import duties including antidumping duties 
however  since  imports of titanium sponge  ingot and mill products  principally from russia and kazakhstan  have increased and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
to the extent the company has been able to take advantage of this situation by purchasing sponge  ingot or intermediate and finished mill products from such countries for use in its own operations  the negative effect of these imports on the company has been somewhat mitigated 
generally  imports of titanium products into the us are subject to a normal trade relations tariff 
for tariff purposes  titanium products are broadly classified as either wrought bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing or unwrought sponge  ingot  slab and billet 
prior antidumping orders on imports of titanium sponge from japan and countries of the former soviet union were revoked in the us maintains a trade program referred to as the generalized system of preferences or gsp program designed to promote the economies of a number of lesser developed countries referred to as beneficiary developing countries by eliminating duties on a specific list of products imported from any of these beneficiary developing countries 
of the key titanium producing countries outside the us  russia and kazakhstan are currently regarded as beneficiary developing countries under the gsp program 
for most periods since  imports of titanium wrought products from any beneficiary developing country notably russia  as a producer of wrought products were exempted from us import duties under the gsp program 
kazakhstan has filed a petition with the office of the us trade representative seeking gsp status on imports of titanium sponge  which  if granted  would eliminate the tariff currently imposed on titanium sponge imported into the us from any beneficiary developing country notably russia and kazakhstan  as producers of titanium sponge 
timet has successfully resisted  and will continue to resist  efforts to date to expand the scope of the gsp program to eliminate duties on sponge and other unwrought titanium products  although no assurances can be made that the company will continue to be successful in these activities 
no formal decision on the treatment of the gsp petition on titanium sponge has been announced by the us trade representative  although the company expects that action on the petition will be taken in antidumping orders permitting duties on imports of titanium sponge from japan and the former soviet union were revoked in further reductions in  or the complete elimination of  any or all of these tariffs  including expansion of the gsp program to unwrought titanium products  could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could adversely affect pricing for titanium sponge and mill products and thus the company s business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
however  since the company has been a large importer of foreign titanium sponge  particularly from kazakhstan  into the us to the extent the company remains a substantial purchaser of foreign sponge  any adverse effects on product pricing as a result of any reduction in  or elimination of  any of these tariffs would be partially ameliorated by the decreased cost to the company for foreign sponge to the extent it currently bears the cost of the import duties 
producers of other metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities that could be used or modified without substantial expenditures to process titanium products 
the company believes  however  that entry as a producer of titanium sponge would require a significant capital investment and substantial technical expertise 
titanium mill products also compete with stainless steels  nickel alloys  steel  plastics  aluminum and composites in many applications 
research and development 
the company s research and development activities are directed toward expanding the use of titanium and titanium alloys in all market sectors 
key research activities include the development of new alloys  development of technology required to enhance the performance of timet s products in the traditional industrial and aerospace markets and applications development in the automotive division and other emerging markets 
the company conducts the majority of its research and development activities at its henderson technical laboratory in henderson  nevada  with additional activities at its witton  england facility 
the company incurred research and development costs of million in and million in both and patents and trademarks 
the company holds us and us patents applicable to certain of its titanium alloys and manufacturing technology 
the company continually seeks patent protection with respect to its technical base and has occasionally entered into cross licensing arrangements with third parties 
the company believes the trademarks timet r and timetal r  which are protected by registration in the us and other countries  are important to its business 
further  timet feels its proprietary timetal exhaust grade  patented timetal s connecting rod alloy  patented timetal lcb spring alloy and patented timetal ti engine valve alloy give it competitive advantages in the automotive market 
however  most of the titanium alloys and manufacturing technology used by the company do not benefit from patent or other intellectual property protection 
employees 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and its impact on the company s business is the principal reason the company periodically implements cost reduction restructurings  reorganizations and other changes that impact the company s employment levels 
the following table shows the fluctuation in the number of employees over the past years 
the decrease in employees from to and the increase in employees from to were principally in response to changes in market demand for the company s products 
the decrease in met the company s targeted reductions announced during the third quarter of during  the company expects to continue efforts to reduce employment in response to anticipated reduced demand for titanium products 
employees at december  us    europe total    the company s production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  ohio  and its production and maintenance workers in henderson  nevada are represented by the united steelworkers of america uswa under contracts expiring in june and october  respectively

the titanium industry derives a substantial portion of its demand from the highly cyclical commercial aerospace industry 
the company estimates that aggregate industry shipment volume for titanium mill products in was derived from the following markets from aerospace  from industrial  and from emerging markets 
the commercial aerospace sector is the principal driver of titanium consumed in the aerospace markets  accounting for shipments of approximately  metric tons in  which represent about of mill product aerospace shipments and about of aggregate mill product industry shipments 
mill product shipments to military aerospace markets in were approximately  metric tons  which represent about of aggregate mill product shipments 
the company s business is more dependent on commercial aerospace demand than the overall titanium industry  as approximately of its mill product sales volume in was represented by sales to this sector 
the economic slowdown in the united states and other regions of the world in the latter part of and the september  terrorist attacks combined to negatively impact commercial air travel in the united states and abroad throughout although airline passenger traffic showed improvement in the months immediately following the terrorist attacks  current data indicates that traffic remains below pre attack levels 
as a result  the us airline industry is expected to record a second consecutive year of losses and two major us airlines were forced to seek bankruptcy protection from their creditors 
airlines have announced a number of actions to reduce both costs and capacity including  but not limited to  the early retirement of airplanes  the deferral of scheduled deliveries of new aircraft and allowing purchase options to expire 
the company s order backlog at the end of december was approximately million  unchanged from the end of september the company s order backlog was million at the end of december substantially all the year end backlog is scheduled for shipment during however  the company s order backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business activity 
since september   the company has received a number of deferrals and cancellations of previously scheduled orders and believes such requests will continue into the company expects the current slowdown in the commercial aerospace sector to continue through before beginning a modest upturn in see outlook for further discussion of the company s business expectations for the table on the following page summarizes certain information regarding the company s results of operations for the past three years 
average selling prices  as reported by the company  are a reflection not just of actual selling prices received by the company  but other related factors such as currency exchange rates and customer and product mix in a given period 
consequently  changes in average selling prices from period to period will be impacted by changes occurring not just in actual prices  but by these other factors as well 
in the following discussion  the company has attempted to adjust for the effects of changes in currency and mix when referring to the percentage change in selling prices from period to period 
year ended december  in thousands net sales    gross margin    operating loss income    gross margin percent of net sales percent change in mill product sales volume mill product average selling prices melted product sales volume melted product average selling prices change expressed in billing currencies and adjusted for product mix 
operations 
the company s sales of mill products in decreased from million in to million in this decrease was principally due to a decrease in mill product sales volume and changes in customer and product mix 
the company s estimated sales volume to the commercial aerospace sector declined approximately during compared to mill product average selling prices expressed in us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods during increased compared to selling prices 
in billing currencies which exclude the effects of foreign currency translation  mill product average selling prices increased over levels 
melted product sales decreased from million in to million in primarily due to a decrease in melted product sales volume and changes in customer and product mix 
melted product average selling prices decreased from melted product prices 
gross margin net sales less cost of sales was negative of sales in  compared to in the prior year 
gross margin in was most adversely impacted by the decline in production volume and the related impact on manufacturing overhead costs 
as the company reduces production volume in response to reduced requirements  certain manufacturing overhead costs decrease at a slower rate and to a lesser extent than production volume changes  generally resulting in higher costs relative to production levels 
average plant operating rates declined from approximately of capacity in to approximately in in addition  the company recorded certain provisions for excess and slow moving inventories during that  due to business conditions existing during  including a number of customer order cancellations  were approximately million greater than in the company also incurred severance costs of approximately million related to global manufacturing workforce reductions undertaken throughout gross margin during was adversely impacted by million of estimated costs related to the tungsten matter described below and million of equipment impairment charges described in operations

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in march  the company was notified by one of its customers that a product the customer manufactured from standard grade titanium produced by the company contained what has been confirmed to be a tungsten inclusion 
the company believes that the source of this tungsten was contaminated silicon  which is used as an alloying addition to titanium at the melting stage  purchased from an outside vendor in at the present time  the company is aware of six standard grade ingots that have been demonstrated to contain tungsten inclusions 
based upon the company s assessment of possible losses  timet recorded an aggregate charge to cost of sales for this matter of million during during  the company charged million against this accrual to write down its remaining on hand inventory and made million in settlement payments  resulting in a million accrual as of december  for potential future claims 
during  the company made settlement payments aggregating million and has also revised its estimate of the most likely amount of loss to be incurred  resulting in a credit of million to cost of sales during as of december   million is accrued for pending and potential future claims 
this amount represents the company s best estimate of the most likely amount of loss yet to be incurred 
this amount does not represent the maximum possible loss  which is not possible for the company to estimate at this time  and may be periodically revised in the future as more facts become known 
as of december  the company has received claims aggregating approximately million and has made settlement payments aggregating million 
pending claims are being investigated and negotiated 
the company believes that certain claims are without merit or can be settled for less than the amount of the original claim 
there is no assurance that all potential claims have yet been submitted to the company 
the company has filed suit seeking full recovery from its silicon supplier for any liability the company might incur  although no assurances can be given that the company will ultimately be able to recover all or any portion of such amounts 
the company has not recorded any recoveries related to this matter as of december  selling  general  administrative and development expenses decreased in compared to  principally due to the inclusion of million of incentive compensation related to the boeing settlement in discussed in operations and lower personnel related costs in  partially offset by higher selling and marketing costs 
equity in earnings losses of joint ventures in decreased from principally due to a decrease in earnings of valtimet  the company s owned welded tube joint venture 
the company recognized million of income for the year ended december  related to the take or pay provisions of the boeing lta  as amended 
the terms of the amended boeing lta allow boeing to purchase up to million pounds of titanium product annually from timet through  but limit timet s maximum quarterly volume obligation to million pounds 
the lta is structured as a take or pay agreement such that  beginning in calendar year  boeing forfeits per pound of its advance payment in the event that its orders for delivery are less than million pounds in any given calendar year 
the company recognizes income to the extent boeing s year to date orders for delivery plus timet s maximum quarterly volume obligations for the remainder of the year total less than million pounds 
this income is recognized as other operating income and is not included in sales revenue  sales volume or gross margin 
based on actual purchases of approximately million pounds during  the company recognized other income for million pounds that boeing did not purchase under the lta during operations 
sales of mill products in increased from million in to million in this increase was principally due to a increase in mill product sales volume and changes in customer and product mix 
the company s estimated shipment volume to the commercial aerospace sector increased approximately during compared to mill product average selling prices expressed in us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods during approximated selling prices 
in billing currencies which exclude the effects of foreign currency translation  mill product average selling prices increased over levels 
melted product sales increased from million in to million in due to the net effects of a increase in melted product sales volume  an increase in melted product average selling prices and changes in customer and product mix 
gross margin was of sales in  compared to in the prior year  primarily reflecting the net effects of higher selling prices  higher operating rates at certain plants  lower sponge costs and changes in customer and product mix 
gross margin for was adversely impacted by higher scrap costs  higher energy costs  million of equipment impairment charges discussed below and million of estimated costs related to the tungsten inclusion matter 
in comparison  gross margin in was adversely impacted by a million equipment impairment charge and a million charge for anticipated environmental remediation costs 
during the second quarter of  the company determined that an impairment of the carrying amount of certain long lived assets located at its millbury  massachusetts facility had occurred  as the assets undiscounted future cash flows could no longer support their carrying amount 
this determination was made after the company completed studies of the potential uses of these assets in the foreseeable future as well as the economic viability of those alternatives 
as a result  the company recorded a million pre tax impairment charge to cost of sales in  representing the difference between the assets previous carrying amounts and their estimated fair values  based on a third party appraisal 
in april  the company reached a settlement of the litigation between timet and boeing related to the parties lta 
pursuant to the settlement  the company received a cash payment of million and recorded approximately million cash settlement less legal fees as other operating income  with partially offsetting operating expenses of approximately million for employee incentive compensation and other costs reported as a component of selling  general  administrative and development expense  resulting in a net pre tax income effect of million in selling  general  administrative and development expenses increased in compared to principally due to the approximate million of employee incentive compensation discussed above 
equity in earnings losses of joint ventures in increased by million from principally due to the increase in earnings of valtimet  the company s owned welded tube joint venture 
other operating income expense  net in reflected a million gain related to the termination of the company s agreement to sell titanium sponge to union titanium sponge corporation  which was offset by a million restructuring charge related to the company s plan to address then current market and operating conditions

because of various factors affecting smc subsequent to the terrorist attacks of september   the company undertook an assessment of its investment in the smc securities in the fourth quarter of with the assistance of an external valuation specialist 
the smc convertible preferred securities are not publicly traded and  accordingly  quoted market prices are unavailable 
as such  the assessment of fair value of these securities required significant judgment and considered a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the financial health and prospects of smc and market yields of comparable securities 
the assessment indicated that it was unlikely the company would recover its then existing carrying amount  including accrued dividends and interest  of the securities in accordance with the securities contractual terms and that an other than temporary decline in the fair value of its investment had occurred 
the company recorded a million pre tax impairment charge in the fourth quarter of to reduce the carrying amount of this investment  including accrued dividends and interest  to an estimated fair value of million 
at that time the company also ceased accruing dividend income on these securities 
subsequently  on march   smc and its us subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
as a result  the company undertook a further assessment of its investment in smc  again with the assistance of the same external valuation specialist  and recorded an additional million impairment charge during the first quarter of for an other than temporary decline in the estimated fair value of its investment in smc 
this charge reduced the company s carrying amount of its investment in smc to zero

 goodwill is no longer amortized on a periodic basis  but instead is subject to a two step impairment test to be performed on at least an annual basis 
in order to test for transitional impairment  sfas no 
required the company to identify its reporting units and determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning its assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  the company determined that it operates one reporting unit  as that term is defined by sfas no 
 consisting of the company in total 
the first step of the impairment test required the company to determine the fair value of its reporting unit and compare it to that reporting unit s carrying amount 
this evaluation was completed with the assistance of an external valuation specialist and considered a combination of fair value indicators including quoted market prices  prices of comparable businesses and discounted cash flows 
the evaluation  which was completed during the second quarter of  indicated that the company s recorded goodwill might be impaired and required the company to complete the second step of the impairment test 
the second step of the impairment test  which was completed during the third quarter of  required the company to compare the implied fair value of its reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
with the assistance of the external valuation specialist utilized in the step one testing  the company determined the implied fair value of its goodwill was zero 
accordingly  the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  representing the entire balance of the company s recorded goodwill at january  there was no income tax benefit associated with this charge 
while the goodwill associated with the company s us operations is deductible for income tax purposes  the company does not currently recognize an income tax benefit associated with its us losses 
in addition the goodwill associated with the company s european operations is not deductible for income tax purposes

undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements  as more fully discussed in the forward looking information statement of this annual report 
actual results may differ materially 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding commitments  contingencies  legal  environmental and other matters  which may materially affect the company s future business  results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
as previously discussed  the economic slowdown in the united states and other regions of the world in the latter part of in combination with the effects of the september  terrorist attacks negatively impacted commercial air travel in the united states and abroad throughout although general economic conditions have improved relative to levels  current data indicates that commercial airline passenger traffic remains below pre attack levels  and the company expects the current slowdown in the commercial aerospace sector to continue through before beginning a modest upturn in in addition  the continuing war on terrorism and potential global conflicts could damage an already fragile economy  delay the recovery in airline passenger traffic and exacerbate the current downturn in the commercial aerospace industry 
as a result  demand for titanium in the commercial aerospace market remains soft 
in response  airlines have announced a number of actions to reduce both costs and capacity including  but not limited to  the early retirement of airplanes  the deferral of scheduled deliveries of new aircraft and allowing purchase options to expire 
the major commercial airframe and jet engine manufacturers have substantially reduced their production levels in  and the forecast of engine and aircraft deliveries over the next few years is expected to remain at these reduced levels 
the company expects that aggregate industry mill product shipments will decrease in by approximately to about  metric tons 
the company believes that demand for mill products for the commercial aerospace sector could decline by up to in  primarily due to a combination of reduced aircraft production rates and excess inventory accumulated throughout the aerospace supply chain since september  excess inventory accumulation typically leads to order demand for titanium products falling below actual consumption 
according to the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  the worldwide commercial airline industry reported an estimated operating loss of approximately billion in  compared with an operating loss of billion in and operating income of billion in the airline monitor traditionally issues forecasts for commercial aircraft deliveries each january and july 
according to the airline monitor  large commercial aircraft deliveries for the to period peaked in with aircraft  including wide body aircraft that use substantially more titanium than their narrow body counterparts 
large commercial aircraft deliveries totaled including wide bodies in the airline monitor s most recently issued forecast of january calls for deliveries in  deliveries in and deliveries in relative to  these forecasted delivery rates represent anticipated declines of about in  in and in after  the airline monitor calls for a continued increase each year in large commercial aircraft deliveries through  with forecasted deliveries of aircraft in exceeding levels 
deliveries of titanium generally precede aircraft deliveries by about one year  although this varies considerably by titanium product 
this correlates to the company s cycle  which historically precedes the cycle of the aircraft industry and related deliveries 
the company can give no assurance as to the extent or duration of the current commercial aerospace cycle or the extent to which it will affect demand for the company s products 
although the current business environment makes it particularly difficult to predict timet s future performance  the company believes sales revenue in will remain flat compared to at approximately million to million  reflecting the combined effects of increases in sales volume offset by continued softening of market selling prices and changes in customer and product mix 
mill product sales volume is expected to increase approximately from levels to about  metric tons and melted product sales volume is expected to increase approximately relative to  to approximately  metric tons 
the company expects approximately of its mill product sales volume will be derived from the commercial aerospace sector as compared to in  with the balance from military aerospace  industrial and emerging markets 
the overall mill product sales volume increase in is principally driven by an anticipated increase in the company s military aerospace  military armor and industrial sales volume compared to  partially offset by sales volume declines in commercial aerospace and various emerging markets 
market selling prices on new orders for titanium products  while difficult to forecast  are expected to continue to soften throughout however  about one half of the company s anticipated commercial aerospace volume in is under ltas that provide the company with selling price stability on that portion of its business 
the company may sell substantially similar titanium products to different customers at varying selling prices due to the effect of ltas  timing of purchase orders and market fluctuations 
there are also wide differences in selling prices across different titanium products that the company offers 
accordingly  the mix of customers and products sold affects the average selling price realized and has an important impact on sales revenue and gross margin 
average selling prices  as reported by the company  are a reflection not just of actual selling prices received by the company  but other related factors such as currency exchange rates and customer and product mix in a given period 
consequently  changes in average selling prices from period to period will be impacted by changes occurring not just in actual prices  but in these other factors as well 
the company s cost of sales is affected by a number of factors including  among others  customer and product mix  material yields  plant operating rates  raw material costs  labor and energy costs 
raw material costs represent the largest portion of the company s manufacturing cost structure 
the company expects to manufacture a significant portion of its titanium sponge requirements in and purchase the balance 
the company expects the aggregate cost of purchased sponge and scrap to remain relatively stable in as compared to the company expects its overall capacity utilization to average about in  down from in  however  the company s practical capacity utilization measures can vary significantly based on product mix 
as the company reduces production volume in response to reduced requirements  certain manufacturing overhead costs decrease at a slower rate and to a lesser extent than production volume changes  generally resulting in higher costs relative to production levels 
during the company undertook a number of actions to reduce its costs  including reductions in employment levels  more stringent spending controls and programs to improve manufacturing yields 
however  the continued softening of market selling prices is expected to substantially offset the benefits of these actions  resulting in an expected gross margin in of between negative and break even 
the company expects gross margin to improve during the year as production volumes begin to increase somewhat 
selling  general  administrative and development expenses for should approximate million 
interest expense in should approximate million 
minority interest on the company s convertible preferred securities in should approximate million  including additional dividend costs related to the deferral of the related dividend payments 
the company anticipates that boeing will purchase about million pounds of product in at this projected order level  the company expects to recognize about million of income under the boeing lta s take or pay provisions in any such earnings will be reported as operating income  but will not be included in sales revenue  sales volume or gross margin 
the company s effective consolidated income tax rate is expected to be significantly below the us statutory rate  as no income tax benefit is expected to be recorded on us or us losses during during the fourth quarter of  timet uk began to generate net deferred tax assets  and the company determined that future realization of its uk deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
therefore  no income tax benefit is expected to be recorded on uk losses during the company operates in several tax jurisdictions and is subject to varying income tax rates 
as a result  the geographic mix of pre tax income loss can significantly impact the company s overall effective tax rate 
the company presently expects an operating loss in of million to million and a net loss of million to million  before any potential restructuring or other special charges or changes in accounting principle 
the company presently anticipates its results in the last half of will be improved compared to the first half due to the improvement in gross margins and because the estimated million expected to be earned under the take or pay provision of the boeing lta will be recognized in the last half of the year 
the company expects to generate million to million in cash flow from operations during this is principally driven by reductions in working capital  especially inventory  and the deferral of the dividends on the convertible preferred securities 
the company received the advance of million million less million for subcontractor purchases from boeing in early january capital expenditures in should approximate million  principally covering capital maintenance  safety and environmental programs 
depreciation and amortization should approximate million 
bank debt is expected to decrease in as compared to year end levels 
at december   the company had over million of borrowing availability under its various worldwide credit agreements 
the company believes its cash  cash flow from operations and borrowing availability will satisfy its expected working capital  capital expenditures and other requirements in the company is not satisfied with the projected results for and has undertaken further cost reduction measures 
the company is redoubling its efforts to achieve aggressive spending reductions  supplier price concessions and manufacturing process improvements  and additional salaried headcount reductions are expected 
on a longer term basis  the company is continuing to evaluate product line and facilities consolidations that may permit it to meaningfully reduce its cost structure in the future while maintaining and even increasing its market share 
accordingly  the company s results in could include one or more charges for restructurings  asset impairments or similar charges that might be material 
likewise  to the extent that cost reductions meet or exceed target goals  results may be somewhat better than currently forecast 
in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation covered under the scope of sfas no 
is recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred  with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the company expects to recognize a cummulative effect loss of approximately million and an asset retirement obligation of approximately million upon adoption of sfas no 
on january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the company has adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements related to discussion of the company s workers compensation surety bond guarantees 
the company will adopt the recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation on a prospective basis for any guarantees issued or modified after december  in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
except for timet capital trust i discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company does not believe it has any variable interest entity covered by the scope of fasb interpretation no 
the company has consolidated timet capital trust i since its formation  as the company owns of the trust s outstanding voting securities 
the company will adopt this interpretation no later than the quarter ended september  the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on the company 
liquidity and capital resources the company s consolidated cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three years are presented below 
the following should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
year ended december  in thousands cash provided used by operating activities excluding changes in assets and liabilities    changes in assets and liabilities    investing activities    financing activities    net cash used provided by operating  investing and financing activities    operating activities 
cash used provided by operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  during the past three years generally follows the trend in operating results 
changes in assets and liabilities reflect the timing of purchases  production and sales  and can vary significantly from period to period 
accounts receivable decreased during primarily as a result of reduced sales  partially offset by an increase in days sales outstanding as certain customers extended their payment terms to the company 
accounts receivable increased in  principally as a result of increased sales 
accounts receivable decreased during  reflecting the decrease in sales levels as well as an improvement in collections as reflected by a decrease in the average number of days that receivables were outstanding 
the significant reduction in receivables in was also attributable to million of customer payments received in the first quarter of related to a bill and hold arrangement entered into near the end of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
inventories decreased during primarily as a result of reduced production in the fourth quarter of and an increase in the company s reserves for excess inventories  which the company recorded in response to decreased demand for its products and other changes in business conditions 
inventories increased in  reflecting material purchases and production rates that were based on expected sales levels higher than actual sales levels achieved 
due to the impact of the september  terrorist attacks  a number of customer order deferrals and cancellations were received late in  contributing to the inventory increase 
the company reduced inventories during as excess raw materials and other inventory items were consumed and inventory reduction and control efforts were put in place 
in april  the company reached a settlement of the litigation between timet and boeing 
pursuant to the settlement  the company received a cash payment of million million net of legal fees and in december received a million customer advance from boeing related to fiscal purchases 
this advance was reduced to million at the end of as a result of shipments and orders from boeing as well as the recognition of take or pay income 
through the company will receive a similar annual advance in january of the year to which the advance is related 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
net accounts with related parties decreased during primarily as a result of cash received from tremont related to an intercorporate services agreement and from a reduction in sales to valtimet 
changes in net accounts with related parties during and resulted primarily from relative changes in receivable levels with joint ventures 
prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased during due to the receipt of raw materials for which the company had made advance payments during and the ongoing usage of other prepaid assets 
dividends for the period october through december on the company s investment in smc convertible preferred securities were deferred by smc 
in april  smc resumed current dividend payments of million each quarter  however  dividends and interest in arrears were not paid 
on october   the company was notified by smc of smc s intention to again defer the payment of dividends effective with the dividend due on october  the smc convertible preferred securities held by timet are not publicly traded and  accordingly  quoted market prices are unavailable 
as more fully discussed in results of operations non operating income expense  net  the company recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million related to these securities  including accrued dividends and interest  in the fourth quarter of and ceased accruing dividend income on these securities at that time 
additionally  the company recorded a charge of million related to these securities in the first quarter of that reduced the carrying amount of these securities to zero 
the ultimate amount  if any  which the company may realize from its investment in the smc securities is unknown due to the uncertainties associated with smc s bankruptcy proceedings  however  the company believes it is unlikely that it will recover any amount from this investment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred income tax benefits in primarily reflect benefits recognized related to european losses  as the company did not record any benefits related to its us losses 
beginning in  the company will also not record any benefits related to its uk losses 
deferred income taxes in were primarily due to an increase in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance to offset previously recorded tax benefits which did not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
deferred income taxes in primarily reflect net tax refunds of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as more fully discussed in results of operations minority interest  in october the company exercised its right to defer future dividend payments on its convertible preferred securities  although dividends will continue to accrue at the coupon rate on the principal and unpaid dividends 
this deferral was effective beginning with the company s december  scheduled dividend payment 
the company will consider resuming payment of dividends on the convertible preferred securities once the outlook for the company s business improves substantially 
since the company exercised its right to defer dividend payments  it is unable under the terms of these securities to  among other things  pay dividends on or reacquire its capital stock during the deferral period 
however  the company is permitted to reacquire the convertible preferred securities during the deferral period  subject to certain us credit facility limitations 
in april  the company similarly exercised its right to defer future dividend payments on its convertible preferred securities 
in the second quarter of  a portion of the boeing settlement  described above  was used to pay the previously deferred aggregate dividends of million and resume the payment of the regularly scheduled dividends 
changes in accrued dividends on convertible preferred securities reflect this activity 
investing activities 
the company s capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in capital spending for and was principally for safety and maintaining capacity 
capital spending for was principally for capacity enhancements  capital maintenance  and safety and environmental projects 
proceeds of million from the sale of the company s castings joint venture in represent the proceeds from the company s sale to wyman gordon of the company s interest in wyman gordon titanium castings  llc 
this transaction is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
financing activities 
net borrowings of million during are primarily attributable to increases in working capital exclusive of cash 
timet savoie made a million dividend payment to cezus in the second quarter of the company incurred approximately million in financing costs in conjunction with the company s amendment of its us revolving credit agreement in these costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the agreement  which matures in february see further discussion in borrowing arrangements 
net repayments of million in are principally the result of the company s litigation settlement with boeing 
net repayments of million in reflect reductions of outstanding borrowings principally in the us resulting from collection of receivables  reduction in inventories  tax refunds  proceeds from the sale of the company s casting joint venture and deferral of dividend payments on the company s convertible preferred securities 
in addition  the company incurred approximately million in financing costs in in conjunction with the company s completion of a new us revolving credit agreement 
borrowing arrangements 
at december   the company s net debt cash and cash equivalents less indebtedness  excluding capital lease obligations  convertible preferred securities and accrued dividends thereon was approximately million  consisting of million of cash and equivalents and million of debt principally borrowings under the company s us and uk credit agreements 
this compares to a net cash position of approximately million as of december  during january  the company received approximately million from boeing under the terms of the parties amended lta  which was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the company s us credit agreement 
on october   the company amended its existing us asset based revolving credit agreement  extending the maturity date to february under the terms of the amendment  borrowings are limited to the lesser of million or a formula determined borrowing base derived from the value of accounts receivable  inventory and equipment borrowing availability 
this facility requires the company s us daily cash receipts to be used to reduce outstanding borrowings  which may then be reborrowed  subject to the terms of the agreement 
interest generally accrues at rates that vary from libor plus to libor plus 
borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of the company s us assets 
the credit agreement prohibits the payment of dividends on timet s convertible preferred securities if excess availability  as defined  is less than million  limits additional indebtedness  prohibits the payment of dividends on the company s common stock if excess availability is less than million  requires compliance with certain financial covenants and contains other covenants customary in lending transactions of this type 
the company was in compliance in all material respects with all covenants for all periods during the years ended december  and excess availability is essentially unused borrowing availability and is defined as borrowing availability less outstanding borrowings and certain contractual commitments such as letters of credit 
as of december   excess availability was approximately million 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under these credit agreements was and as of december  and  respectively 
the company s us credit agreement allows the lender to modify the borrowing base formulas at its discretion  subject to certain conditions 
during the second quarter of  the company s lender elected to exercise such discretion and modified the company s borrowing base formulas  which reduced the amount that the company could have borrowed against its inventory and equipment by approximately million 
in the event the lender exercises such discretion in the future  such event could have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity 
borrowings outstanding under this us facility are classified as a current liability 
the company s subsidiary  timet uk  has a credit agreement that provides for borrowings limited to the lesser of pound million or a formula determined borrowing base derived from the value of accounts receivable  inventory and equipment borrowing availability 
the credit agreement includes a revolving and term loan facility and an overdraft facility the uk facilities 
on december   the company renewed and amended its existing uk facilities  extending the maturity date to december  and reducing the maximum borrowing base from pound million to pound million to more appropriately match timet uk s collateral base 
borrowings under the uk facilities can be in various currencies including us dollars  british pounds sterling and euros  accrue interest at rates that vary from libor plus to libor plus  and are collateralized by substantially all of timet uk s assets 
the uk facilities require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and amounts and other covenants customary in lending transactions of this type 
timet uk was in compliance in all material respects with all covenants for all periods during the years ended december  and the uk overdraft facility is subject to annual review in december of each year 
in the event the overdraft facility is not renewed  the company believes it could refinance any outstanding overdraft borrowings under either the revolving or term loan features of the uk facilities 
unused borrowing availability as of december  under the uk facilities was approximately million 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under these credit agreements was and as of december  and  respectively 
the company also has overdraft and other credit facilities at certain of its other european subsidiaries 
these facilities accrue interest at various rates and are payable on demand 
unused borrowing availability as of december  under these facilities was approximately million 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under these credit agreements was and as of december  and  respectively 
although excess availability under timet s us credit agreement remains above million  no dividends were paid by timet on its common shares during  or timet does not anticipate paying dividends on its common shares during and  as previously discussed  is not permitted to pay such dividends while deferring dividend payments on its convertible preferred securities 
contractual commitments 
as more fully described in notes   and to the consolidated financial statements  the company is a party to various debt  lease and other agreements at december  that contractually and unconditionally commit the company to pay certain amounts in the future 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments that are unconditional both in terms of timing and amount by the type and date of payment 
unconditional payment due date after total contractual commitment in thousands indebtedness    capital leases   operating leases    obligations to basic management  inc      minimum sponge purchase commitments     company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debt securities bucs   accrued dividends on bucs   commitments based on an assumed constant mix of products purchased 
represents total dividends accrued on the bucs at december   including dividends due on december  and deferred as of that date 
based on the deferral  the deferred dividends are not contractually due until march  defined benefit pension plans 
the company maintains two defined benefit pension plans in the us  one in the us and one in france 
the majority of the discussion below relates to the us and us plans  as the french plan is not material to the company s consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations or cash flows 
the company recorded consolidated pension expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pension expense for these periods was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate the company utilizes for determining pension expense and pension obligations is based on a review of long term bonds to year maturities that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies generally merrill lynch  moody s  solomon smith barney and ubs warburg as well as composite indices provided by the company s actuaries 
changes in the company s discount rate over the past three years reflect the decline in such bond rates during that time period 
the company establishes a rate that is used to determine obligations as of the year end date and expense for the subsequent year 
the company used the following discount rates for its pension plans discount rates used for obligation at obligation at obligation at december  december  december  and expense in and expense in and expense in us plans uk plan in developing the company s expected long term rate of return assumption  the company evaluated historical market rates of return and input from its actuaries  including a review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns are based on broad equity large cap  small cap and international and bond corporate and government indices as well as an anticipation that the plans active investment managers will generate premiums above the standard market projections 
the company s assumed rate of return for was for its us plans and for its uk plan based upon these projections 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on the company s us plans assets by from to would have increased pension expense by approximately million  and lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased the company s us plans pension expense by approximately million 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on the company s uk plan s assets by from to would have increased pension expense by approximately million  and lowering the discount rate assumption by would have increased the company s uk plan s pension expense by approximately million 
based on continued market declines and losses on the plan assets during  as well as future projected asset mix  the company reduced its assumed long term rate of return for to for its us plans and for its uk plan 
the company s future expected long term rate of return on plan assets for its us and us plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of equity securities and fixed income securities 
because of market fluctuations and prior funding strategies  actual asset allocation as of december  was equity securities and fixed income securities for the us plans and equity securities and fixed income securities for the uk plan 
the company believes  however  that the plans future long term asset allocation on average will approximate the assumed allocation 
although the expected rate of return is a long term measure  the company will continue to evaluate its expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust it as considered necessary 
among other things  the company bases its determination of pension expense for all plans on the fair value of plan assets 
the expected return on the fair value of the plan assets  determined based on the expected long term rate of return  is a component of pension expense 
this methodology further recognizes actual investment gains or losses ie the difference between the expected and actual returns based on the market value of assets in pension expense through amortization in future periods based upon the expected average remaining service life of the plan participants 
based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions  the company estimates that pension expense for its us plans will approximate million in  million in and million in a increase decrease in the discount rate would decrease increase projected pension expense by approximately million in  and a increase decrease in the long term rate of return would similarly decrease increase projected pension expense by approximately million in and and by million in based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions including an exchange rate of pound  the company estimates that pension expense for its uk plan will approximate million in  million in and million in a increase decrease in the discount rate would decrease increase projected pension expense by approximately million in and in and million in a increase decrease in the long term rate of return would decrease increase projected pension expense by approximately million in and and million in actual future pension expense will depend on future actual investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the company s pension plans 
the company made cash contributions of approximately million in and million in to the us plans and cash contributions of approximately million in and million in to the uk plan 
based upon the current underfunded status of the plans and the actuarial assumptions being used for  the company believes that it will be required to make cash contributions of approximately million in  million in and million in to the us plans and approximately million in  million in and million in to the uk plan 
certain employee contributions are also required by the uk plan 
the value of the plans assets has decreased the past three years based mainly on poor performance from equity securities 
the us plans assets were million  million and million at december   and  respectively  and the uk plan s assets were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the combination of negative actual investment returns and declining discount rates have increased the company s underfunded plan status plan assets compared to accumulated benefit obligations from million at december  to million at december  for the us plans and from million at december  to million at december  for the uk plan 
because of this underfunded status  the company was required to record an additional minimum pension liability charge to equity of million related to the us plans and million net of million in taxes related to the uk plan in postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
the company provides certain postretirement healthcare and life insurance opeb benefits to the majority of its us employees upon retirement 
the company funds such opeb benefits as they are incurred  net of any retiree contributions 
the company paid opeb benefits  net of retiree contributions  in the amount of million and million during and  respectively 
the company recorded consolidated opeb expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
opeb expense for these periods was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term health care trend rate 
the discount rate the company utilizes for determining opeb expense and opeb obligations is the same as that used for the company s us pension plans 
lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased the company s opeb expense by less than million 
the company estimates the expected long term health care trend rate based upon input from specialists in this area  as provided by the company s actuaries 
in estimating the health care trend rate  the company considers industry trends  the company s actual healthcare cost experience and the company s future benefit structure 
for  the company used a beginning health care trend rate of  which is projected to reduce to an ultimate rate of in if the health care trend rate changed by for each year  opeb expense would have increased decreased by approximately million in for  the company is using a beginning health care trend rate of  which is projected to reduce to an ultimate rate of in the company increased its beginning rate based upon actual plan and industry experience during however  the company continues to believe the ultimate trend rate of is appropriate at this time 
based on a discount rate of  a health care trend rate as discussed above and various other assumptions  the company estimates that opeb expense will approximate million in and and million in a increase decrease in the discount rate would decrease increase projected opeb expense by approximately million in  and a increase decrease in the health care trend rate for each year would increase decrease projected opeb expense by approximately million in  and environmental matters

on september   moody s investor service lowered its rating on the company s convertible preferred securities to caa from b standard poor s ratings services s p lowered its rating on the company s convertible preferred securities to ccc from ccc on september   to c from ccc on october  and to d from ccc on december  the company s ability to obtain additional capital in the future could be negatively affected by these rating actions 
the company periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its alternative uses of capital  debt service requirements  the cost of debt and equity capital and estimated future operating cash flows

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments  and select from a range of possible estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory allowances  impairments of investments in preferred securities and investments accounted for by the equity method  the recoverability of other long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and the related underlying actuarial assumptions  the realization of deferred income tax assets  and accruals for environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates and judgments  to varying degrees  on historical experience  advice of external specialists and various other factors it believes to be prudent under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts and such estimates  assumptions and judgments are regularly subject to revision 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of the company s financial statements because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these policies and estimates  as well as discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates 
impairments of long lived assets 
generally  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  may not be recoverable  the company prepares an evaluation of the assets or asset group 
if this evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is not recoverable  the amount of the impairment would typically be calculated using discounted expected future cash flows or appraised values 
all relevant factors are considered in determining whether an impairment exists 
the company completed an entity wide impairment assessment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets during the fourth quarter of in response to continued poor conditions in the commercial aerospace market 
in order to complete this assessment  the company identified its lowest level of identifiable cash flows  resulting in the identification of four asset groups us  us  france and italy 
of these asset groups  italy is not reliant on sales into the commercial aerospace market and therefore an analysis of its potential impairment was not considered necessary 
the result of this assessment led the company to conclude that there was no impairment related to the long lived assets in the three asset groups tested  as the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the net carrying value of the applicable net assets in each of the three asset groups 
although management utilizes certain external information sources such as the airline monitor as the basis for aerospace sales volume projections  significant management judgment is required in estimating other factors that are material to future cash flows including  but not limited to  customer demand  the company s market position  selling prices  competitive forces and manufacturing costs 
future cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that the company will achieve the future cash flows reflected in its projections 
the company also completed an impairment assessment of its goodwill and intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  during  as more fully discussed in results of operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
management judgment was required in order to identify the company s reporting units  determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning its assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january   and determine the implied fair value of its goodwill 
this evaluation  which was completed with the assistance of an external valuation specialist and considered a combination of fair value indicators including quoted market prices  prices of comparable businesses and discounted projected cash flows  indicated that the company s recorded goodwill might be impaired and required the company to complete the second step of the impairment test 
based on the results of the impairment test  the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  representing the entire balance of the company s recorded goodwill at january  valuation and impairment of securities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company evaluates its investments in debt and equity securities whenever events or conditions occur to indicate that the fair value of such investments has declined below their carrying amounts

in response to certain events previously described in this md a  the company undertook assessments in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of of its investment in smc with the assistance of an external valuation specialist 
those assessments indicated that it was unlikely that the company would recover its then existing carrying amount of the smc securities in accordance with the securities contractual terms and that an other than temporary decline in the fair value of its investment had occurred 
accordingly  the company recorded impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of and million in the first quarter of the smc convertible preferred securities held by the company are not publicly traded and  accordingly  quoted market prices are unavailable 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment and considered a number of factors including  but not limited to  the financial health and prospects of the issuer and market yields of comparable securities 
the ultimate amount  if any  which the company may ultimately realize from its investment in the smc securities is unknown due to the uncertainties associated with its bankruptcy proceedings  however  the company believes it is unlikely that it will recover any amount from this investment
