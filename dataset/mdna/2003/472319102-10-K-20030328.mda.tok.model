item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
there are included or incorporated by reference in this report statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements include statements about the company s future and statements that are not historical facts 
these forward looking statements are usually preceded by the words believes  intends  may  will  or similar expressions  whether in the negative or affirmative 
these forward looking statements represent only the company s belief regarding future events  many of which  by their nature  are inherently uncertain and outside of the company s control 
it is possible that the actual results may differ  possibly materially  from the anticipated results indicated in these forward looking statements 
information regarding important factors that could cause actual results to differ  perhaps materially  from those in our forward looking statements is contained in this report  particularly under the heading factors affecting the company s business and in documents incorporated by reference in this report 
the company does not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statement it makes 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
actual results will inevitably differ from estimates 
these differences could be material to the financial statements 
the company believes its application of accounting policies and the estimates required therein are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  the company has found its application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
management believes its critical accounting policies policies that are both material to the financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are its valuation methodologies applied to investments and to securities positions 
investments are stated at estimated fair value as determined in good faith by management 
generally  the company initially values these investments at cost and requires that changes in value be established by meaningful third party transactions or a significant impairment in the financial condition or operating performance of the issuer  unless meaningful developments occur that otherwise warrant a change in the valuation of an investment 
factors considered in valuing individual investments include  without limitation  available market prices  reported net asset values  type of security  purchase price  purchases of the same or similar securities by other investors  marketability  restrictions on disposition  current financial position and operating results  and other pertinent information 
furthermore  judgment is used to value certain securities eg  private securities  a securities  less liquid securities  if quoted market prices are not available 
these valuations are made with consideration for various assumptions  including time value  yield curve  volatility factors  liquidity  market prices on comparable securities and other factors 
the subjectivity involved in this process makes these valuations inherently less reliable than quoted market prices 
the company believes that its comprehensive risk management policies and procedures serve to monitor the appropriateness of the assumptions used 
the use of different assumptions  however  could produce materially different estimates of fair value

factors affecting the company s business in addition to the factors mentioned in the rest of this report  the company is also affected by changes in general economic and business conditions  acts of war  terrorism and natural disasters 
changing conditions in financial markets and the economy could result in decreased revenues 
as an investment banking and securities firm  changes in the financial markets or economic conditions  in the united states and elsewhere in the world  could adversely affect the company in many ways  including the following a further market downturn could lead to a decline in the volume of transactions executed for customers and  therefore  to a decline in the revenues received from commissions and spreads  and unfavorable financial or economic conditions would likely reduce the number and size of transactions in underwriting  financial advisory and other services 
investment banking revenues  in the form of financial advisory and underwriting fees  are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which the company participates and would therefore be adversely affected by a sustained market downturn 
reduced spreads in securities pricing and levels of trading activities could harm our business 
since early  bid  ask and sale prices for stocks traded on the national securities exchanges and in the nasdaq stock market have been quoted in decimal or cent format  rather than in fractions of a dollar 
decimalization has narrowed the differences  or spreads  between bid and ask prices on equity securities and has also reduced price increments for those securities 
decimalization has reduced the revenue per transaction earned from the company s market making and trading operations in which it acts as a principal 
market making and trading activities expose the company to risk of loss 
a significant amount of the company s revenues are derived from market making and trading in which it acts as a principal 
the company may incur trading losses relating to the purchase  sale or short sale of securities for its own account 
in any period  the company may experience losses as a result of losses in its 
table of contents market maker stocks due to reasons such as price declines  lack of trading volume  lack of volatility  and the required performance of its market maker obligations 
from time to time  the company may have large position concentrations in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry 
in general  because the company s inventory of securities is marked to market on a daily basis  any downward price movement in those securities will result in a reduction of the company s operating profits 
the company also operates proprietary trading desks separate from its trading and market maker operations 
the company may incur trading losses as a result of these trading activities 
during  jefferies acquired a group of traders who specialize in trading otc bulletin board and pink sheet securities 
these securities are typically more illiquid  have smaller capitalizations and may involve more risk than nasdaq traded securities 
increased competition may adversely affect the company s revenues and profitability 
all aspects of the company s business are intensely competitive 
the company competes directly with numerous other brokers and dealers  investment banking firms and banks 
in addition to competition from firms currently in the securities business  there has been increasing competition from others offering financial services  including automated trading and other services based on technological innovations 
competition also extends to the hiring and retention of highly skilled employees 
a competitor may be successful in hiring away an employee or group of employees  which may result in the company losing business formerly serviced by such employee or employees 
competition can also raise the company s costs of hiring and retaining the key employees it needs to effectively execute its business plan 
the company s business is substantially dependent on key personnel 
the company s future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of richard b 
handler  the company s chief executive officer 
the company does not have an employment agreement with mr 
handler 
the loss of his services could compromise the company s ability to effectively operate its business 
in addition  in the event that mr 
handler ceases to actively manage the three funds that invest on a pari passu basis with the company s high yield division  investors in those funds would have the right to withdraw from the funds 
although the company has substantial key man life insurance covering mr 
handler  the proceeds from the policy may not be sufficient to offset any loss in business 
in addition  if the number of accounts and transaction volume increase significantly over current volume  the company could be compelled to hire additional personnel 
at that time  there could be a shortage of qualified and  in some cases  licensed personnel whom the company could hire 
this could cause a backlog in the company s handling of investment banking transactions or the processing of brokerage orders  all of which could harm the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
extensive regulation of the company s business limits its activities and  if it violates these regulations  may subject it to significant penalties 
the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws 
the securities and exchange commission is the federal agency responsible for the administration of federal securities laws 
in addition  self regulatory organizations  principally nasd and the securities exchanges  are actively involved in the regulation of broker dealers 
securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions and state attorneys general in those states in which they do business 
broker dealers are subject to regulations which cover all aspects of the securities business  including sales methods  trade practices among broker dealers  use and safekeeping of customers funds and securities  capital structure of securities firms  record keeping and the conduct of directors  officers and employees 
the commission  self regulatory organizations  state securities commissions and state attorneys general may conduct administrative proceedings which can result in censure  fine  suspension  expulsion of a broker dealer  its officers or employees  or revocation of broker dealer licenses 
additional legislation  changes in rules promulgated by the commission and self regulatory organizations  or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules  may directly affect the company s mode of operation and its profitability 

table of contents legal liability may harm the company s business 
many aspects of the company s business involve substantial risks of liability  and in the normal course of business  the company has been named as a defendant or co defendant in lawsuits involving primarily claims for damages 
some of these risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities and other transactions  potential liability for the advice the company provides to participants in corporate transactions and disputes over the terms and conditions of complex trading arrangements 
these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
substantial legal liability against the company could have a material financial effect or cause significant reputational harm to the company  which in turn could seriously harm its business prospects 
operational risks may disrupt the company s business  result in regulatory action against it or limit its growth 
the company faces operational risks arising from mistakes made in the confirmation or settlement of transactions or from transactions not being properly recorded  evaluated or accounted 
the company s business is highly dependent on its ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets  and the transactions it processes have become increasingly complex 
consequently  the company relies heavily on its financial  accounting and other data processing systems 
if any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled  the company could suffer financial loss  a disruption of our business  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
the inability of the company s systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain its ability to expand its business
