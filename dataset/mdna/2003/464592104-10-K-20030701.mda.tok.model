item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion together with the financial statements  including the related notes and the other financial information in this form k 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that require our management to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have summarized our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements 
of our accounting policies  we believe the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity goodwill at april   we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million  representing of total assets 
effective april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which established a new method of testing goodwill and other intangible assets using a fair value based approach and does not permit amortization of goodwill as was previously required 
upon adoption  amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets ceased 
sfas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be tested for impairment annually or if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the company below its book value 
should circumstances change or events occur to indicate that the fair market value of the company has fallen below its book value  management must then compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to book value 
if the book value exceeds the estimated fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
we completed our annual impairment test as required under sfas in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets were not impaired 
this test required comparison of the estimated fair value of each property to book value  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
the estimated fair value includes estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
changes in estimates or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results 
property and equipment at april   we had property and equipment of million  representing of total assets 
we capitalize the cost of property and equipment 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
costs incurred in connection with the company s all properties other capital improvements  program include individual capital expenditures related to the purchase of furniture and equipment and upgrade of hotel rooms  restaurants and other areas of our properties 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
future events such as property expansions  new competition and new regulations could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
effective april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
self insurance liabilities we are self funded up to a maximum amount per claim for our employee related health care benefits program  workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance 
claims in excess of this maximum are fully insured through a stop loss insurance policy 
we accrue for these liabilities based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we also rely on independent consultants to assist in the determination of estimated accruals 
while the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments  such as increases in health care costs  in our opinion  recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments 
income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires that we recognize a current tax asset or liability for the estimated taxes payable or refundable based upon application of the enacted tax rates to taxable income in the current year 
additionally  we are required to recognize a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences 
temporary differences occur when differences arise between a the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and b the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in financial statements 
sfas also requires that any deferred tax asset recognized must be reduced by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits that  in our judgment and based upon available evidence  may not be realizable 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the need for a valuation allowance  are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjusted if necessary 
we use forecasted future operating results and consider enacted tax laws and rates in determining if the valuation allowance is sufficient 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions and are therefore subject to varying tax laws and potential audits  which could impact our assessments and estimates 
contingencies we are involved in various legal proceedings and have identified certain loss contingencies 
we record liabilities related to these contingencies when it is determined that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
these assessments are based on our knowledge and experience as well as the advice of legal counsel regarding current and past events 
any such estimates are also subject to future events  court rulings  negotiations between the parties and other uncertainties 
if an actual loss differs from our estimate  or the actual outcome of any of the legal proceedings differs from expectations  operating results could be impacted 
the company routinely faces challenges from federal and other tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
the company records reserves for probable exposures associated with the various filing positions 
slot club awards we reward our slot customers for their loyalty based on the dollar amount of play on slot machines 
we accrue for these slot club awards based on an estimate of the outstanding value of the awards utilizing the age and prior history of redemptions 
future events such as a change in our marketing strategy or new competition could result in a change in the value of the awards 
general our results of operations for the twelve months ended april   reflect the consolidated operations of all of our subsidiaries  and includes the following properties the isle bossier city  the isle lake charles  the isle biloxi  the isle lula  the isle natchez  the isle tunica  the isle vicksburg  the isle kansas city  the isle boonville  the isle bettendorf  the isle marquette  the rhythm city davenport  the isle black hawk  the lady luck las vegas and pompano park 
isle tunica ceased casino operations on september   which was days prior to the sale of assets to boyd casino strip  llc on october  on october   we completed the sale of the lady luck las vegas but will continue to operate the casino until the purchaser s designated gaming operator receives regulatory approval

the colorado casino operations of igt consist of the colorado central station black hawk  located in black hawk  and the colorado grande cripple creek  located in cripple creek 
the isle black hawk plans to invest approximately million in black hawk to significantly increase covered parking for both properties  add additional casino space  hotel rooms and restaurants  and connect the properties by means of a skywalk that can service both the isle black hawk and the colorado central station black hawk 
this expansion has been delayed until after the outcome of a proposed statewide referendum on video lottery terminals vlts at racetracks in colorado has been determined in november we believe that our historical results of operations may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of the substantial present and expected future increase in competition for gaming customers in each of our markets  as new gaming facilities open and existing gaming facilities expand or enhance their facilities 
we believe that our operating results are affected by the economy  seasonality and weather 
seasonality has historically caused the operating results for our first and fourth fiscal quarters ending in july and april  respectively  to be better than the operating results for the second and third fiscal quarters ending october and january  respectively 
results of operations fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  gross revenues for the fiscal year ended april   were billion  which included billion of casino revenue  million of rooms revenue  million of pari mutuel commissions and million of food  beverage and other revenue 
this compares to gross revenues for the fiscal year ended april  of billion  which included billion of casino revenue  million of rooms revenue  million of pari mutuel commissions and million of food  beverage and other revenue 
casino revenue remained constant year over year on a company wide basis 
a million increase in revenue attributable to a full year of operations at the isle boonville was offset by a million decrease in revenue at the isle lake charles due to new competition and a million decrease at the isle tunica attributable to closing the property on september  rooms revenue decreased million or compared to prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease of  hotel rooms resulting from the sale of the isle tunica and the lady luck las vegas 
food  beverage  pari mutuel and other revenue decreased million or when compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the sale of the isle tunica and the lady luck las vegas 
casino operating expenses for the fiscal year ended april  totaled million  or of casino revenue  versus million  or of casino revenue  for the fiscal year ended april  these expenses are primarily comprised of salaries  wages and benefits and other operating expenses of the casinos 
the decrease in casino operating expenses is primarily the result of closing the isle tunica  a low margin property 
for the fiscal year ended april   state and local gaming taxes totaled million  or of casino revenue  compared to million  or of casino revenue  for the fiscal year ended april   which is consistent with each state s gaming tax rate for the applicable fiscal years 
gaming taxes increased because a larger percentage of our casino revenue was earned in missouri  a higher gaming tax jurisdiction  than in the previous year due to the opening of the isle boonville and a increase in the tax rate at the isle bossier city effective april  an additional increase in the tax rate at the isle bossier city became effective on april  operating expenses for the fiscal year ended april   also included room expenses of million  or of gross room revenue compared to million or of gross room revenue for the fiscal year ended april  the million or decrease in rooms expense was comparable to the decrease in rooms revenue

marketing and administrative expenses totaled million  or of net revenue for the fiscal year ended april   versus million  or of net revenue for the fiscal year ended april  marketing expenses included salaries  wages and benefits of the marketing and sales departments  as well as promotions  advertising  special events and entertainment 
administrative expenses included administration and human resource department expenses  rent  new development activities  professional fees and property taxes 
the million decrease in marketing and administrative expenses  or of net revenue  is primarily due to a million litigation settlement at the isle lake charles that was expensed in fiscal and recovered as income in fiscal  offset by a million increase due to increased competition 
the valuation charge for the fiscal year ended april   totaling million is a reserve for a loss contingency against the investment to date in ardent gaming  llc  an unrelated third party 
the system being developed under the joint venture is substantially past due and we believe it is probable that we will not recover our investment 
the valuation charge for the fiscal year ended april   totaling million reflects the impairment charge of million related to the write down of our assets at the isle tunica and the lady luck las vegas 
on march   our board of directors resolved to sell or otherwise dispose of the property and equipment at the isle tunica and the lady luck las vegas 
as such  we recorded an impairment write down of million  representing the difference between the isle tunica s and the lady luck las vegas carrying values of million and their estimated fair values less estimated costs to sell of million 
we ceased casino operations at the isle tunica on september   which was days prior to the sale of assets to boyd casino strip  llc on october  on october   we completed the sale of the lady luck las vegas but will continue to operate the casino until the purchaser s designated gaming operator receives regulatory approval

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of due to the impairment of the assets 
under this classification  we ceased depreciating these assets 
we estimate that the benefit from suspending depreciation associated with the assets held for sale was approximately million in fiscal interest expense was million for the fiscal year ended april  net of capitalized interest of million and interest income of million versus million for the fiscal year ended april  net of capitalized interest of million and interest income of million 
interest expense primarily relates to indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of property  equipment  leasehold improvements and berthing and concession rights 
additionally  interest expense of million net of interest income of million related to the isle black hawk is included in interest expense for the fiscal year ended april  this compares to interest expense of million net of interest income of million for the fiscal year ended april our effective tax rate was for the fiscal year ended april   as compared to prior to extraordinary items for the fiscal year ended april   which includes the effects of non deductible goodwill amortization for income tax purposes 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended april   was high as a result of the relatively lower pretax book earnings related to the valuation charge for the isle tunica and the lady luck las vegas and low state income tax benefit rate related to the impairment of these assets 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  gross revenues for the fiscal year ended april   were billion  which included billion of casino revenue  million of rooms revenue  million of pari mutuel commissions and million of food  beverage and other revenue 
this compares to gross revenues for the fiscal year ended april   of billion  which included million of casino revenue  million of rooms revenue  million of pari mutuel commissions and million of food  beverage and other revenue 
casino revenue increased million or when compared to the prior year 
this is the result of the million increase in casino revenue at the isle kansas city due to the renovations that improved the property in the prior year and a full year of operations the isle kansas city was acquired in june  million increase in casino revenue at the rhythm city davenport  which was acquired in october  and the addition of million in casino revenue from the isle boonville which opened in december these positive variances from the prior year were partially offset by the million decline in casino revenue at the isle bossier city  primarily attributable to the heightened competition in that market resulting from the opening of hollywood casino s gaming facility and additional hotel rooms at harrah s gaming facility during our fiscal third quarter 
the rooms revenue increase of million or over the prior year was the result of new hotels being completed in the prior year at the isle black hawk in august  and the isle tunica and the isle lake charles in november additionally  the lady luck las vegas had a full year of operations in the current year 
the lady luck las vegas property was acquired in september food  beverage  pari mutuel and other revenue increased million when compared to the prior year primarily as a result of a million increase in food  beverage and other revenue at the rhythm city davenport due to the full year of operations  million in such revenue generated by the isle boonville that opened in the third fiscal quarter of this year  partially offset by the million decline in such revenue at the isle biloxi

marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue have remained stable 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a valuation charge totaling million that reflects the impairment charge of million related to the write down of our assets at the isle tunica and the lady luck las vegas 
we acquired the isle tunica in fiscal and the lady luck las vegas in connection with the purchase of lady luck gaming corporation in fiscal these properties were marginal performers since the date of their acquisition  however  we continued to invest in these properties  primarily the isle tunica where we invested in a hotel and theaters at the casino location 
although some improvement in the operations was realized as a result of these actions  these properties were not projected to have substantial growth in profits as compared to other isle properties 
further  these properties required substantial amounts of management resources and additional capital investments to achieve the earnings levels that were originally envisioned when we purchased these properties 
as a result  we began a process of evaluating our options  including retaining an advisor to assist in the assessment  as disclosed in our third quarter form q 
during the time we held these properties  while the operating results were marginal  management continued to believe that these properties were not impaired 
in addition  we had considered whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets at the isle tunica and the lady luck las vegas were present 
we considered operating losses and negative cash flows at these properties as indicators of impairment and further evaluated the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets in question to determine if these cash flows were less than their carrying amounts 
some of the assumptions that were used in connection with the estimate of undiscounted cash flows included current operating results  costs associated with the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  other operating expenses trends  and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
based on this evaluation and other factors considered  we determined that a lower valuation of these properties was not appropriate prior to the write off in the fourth quarter of fiscal at the end of our fiscal third quarter  we continued to be committed to turning both of these properties around and had begun the process resulting in modest positive cash flow at the isle tunica and reduced losses at the lady luck las vegas during the fourth quarter of fiscal our efforts to increase these properties performance included focused marketing campaigns and extensive cost reductions 
however  on march   our board of directors resolved to sell or otherwise dispose of the property and equipment at the isle tunica and the lady luck las vegas 
this decision was made in consideration of the substantial and disproportionate amount of management resources devoted to the turnaround of these properties  the lack of significant growth potential  current tax benefits to be derived from a sale or disposition and the additional capital required to improve these properties in tunica and las vegas 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we determined in connection with the board s directive that we would not be able to recover the carrying values of the isle tunica or the lady luck las vegas based on current real estate and market conditions in these markets 
as such  we recorded an impairment write down of million  representing the difference between the isle tunica s and the lady luck las vegas carrying values of million and their estimated fair values less estimated costs to sell of million 
fair values were based on our estimate of the likely sale price for these assets  in response to our board s decision 
in addition  we committed to a disposal plan in the fourth quarter of and began aggressively seeking a buyer of the isle tunica and the lady luck las vegas 
also included in fiscal was an impairment charge of million relating to marine assets that have been in storage for future development that will be offered for sale in fiscal the valuation charge for the fiscal year ended april  totaling million consisted of the write down of certain marine assets held for development or sale to their estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell 
preopening expenses of million for the fiscal year ended april   and million for the fiscal year ended april   represent salaries  benefits  training  marketing and other non capitalizable costs  which were expensed in connection with the opening of the isle boonville in december for the prior fiscal year ended april   other charges totaling million included a million loss due to the write off of abandoned expansion projects assets at the isle biloxi  a million loss due to the termination of the enchanted capri joint venture as a result of bankruptcy court filings by commodore holdings  ltd  the operator of the enchanted capri and owner of the remaining interest in the joint venture  a million buyout of the crowne plaza license at the isle biloxi  and a million loss relating to the write off of the theater production contracts at the isle tunica 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for the fiscal year ended april   and million for the fiscal year ended april  these expenses relate to property and equipment 
depreciation expense increased by million compared to the prior year consistent with an increase in fixed assets placed into service or acquired 
this increase was partially offset by the elimination of the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets of million in due to our early adoption of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective april  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reclassified the isle tunica s and the lady luck las vegas property and equipment as assets held for sale under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of due to the impairment of the assets 
under this classification  we no longer depreciated these assets 
we estimate that the benefit from suspending depreciation associated with the assets held for sale was approximately million in fiscal interest expense was million for the fiscal year ended april   net of capitalized interest of million and interest income of million  versus million for the fiscal year ended april   net of capitalized interest of million and interest income of million 
interest expense primarily relates to indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of property  equipment  leasehold improvements and berthing and concession rights 
additionally  interest expense of million net of interest income of million related to the isle black hawk is included in interest expense for the fiscal year ended april  this compares to interest expense of million net of capitalized interest of million and interest income of million for the fiscal year ended april  our effective tax rate was prior to extraordinary items for the fiscal year ended april   and for the fiscal year ended april   which includes the effects of non deductible goodwill amortization for income tax purposes 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended april   was high as a result of the relatively lower pretax book earnings related to the valuation charge for the isle tunica and the lady luck las vegas and low state income tax benefit rate related to the impairment of these assets 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to cash and cash equivalents of million at april  the million increase in cash and cash equivalents is the net result of million net cash provided by operating activities  million net cash used in investing activities and million net cash provided by financing activities 
investing activities we invested million in property and equipment during the fiscal year ended april  the following table reflects expenditures for property and equipment on major projects in fiscal and and projected expenditures for these projects

these bonds will be paid from increased property taxes on each of the casinos benefiting from the improvements 
this expansion has been delayed until after the outcome of a proposed statewide referendum on vlts at racetracks in colorado has been determined in november on july   we entered into an agreement to sell the isle tunica for a cash payment of million and were entitled to retain certain personal property valued at million

the revolving loan commitment is a variable rate instrument based on  at our option  either libor or our lender s prime rate plus the applicable interest rate spread  and is effective through april our lines of credit are also at variable rates based on our lender s prime rate and are subject to annual renewal 
there is no assurance that these sources will in fact provide adequate funding for the expenditures described above or that planned capital investments will be sufficient to allow us to remain competitive in our existing markets 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our senior and subordinated debt instruments as of april  if we do not maintain compliance with these covenants  the lenders under the senior secured credit facility have the option in some cases  after the expiration of contractual grace periods  but not the obligation  to demand immediate repayment of all or any portion of the obligations outstanding under the senior secured credit facility 
any significant deterioration of earnings could affect certain of our covenants 
adverse changes in our credit rating or stock price would not impact our borrowing costs or covenant compliance under existing debt instruments 
future events  such as a significant increase in interest rates can be expected to increase our costs of borrowing under our senior secured credit facility 
the indentures governing our notes and our notes limit  among other things  our ability to borrow money  create liens  make restricted payments  and sell assets 
we are highly leveraged and may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms 
as a result  limitations on our capital resources could delay or cause us to abandon certain plans for capital improvements at our existing properties and development of new properties 
we will continue to evaluate our planned capital expenditures at each of our existing locations in light of the operating performance of the facilities at such locations
