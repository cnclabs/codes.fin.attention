item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation tredegar is a manufacturer of plastic film and aluminum extrusions 
we also have an operating subsidiary focused on healthcare related technologies and an investment subsidiary 
descriptions of our businesses and interests are provided on pages our manufacturing businesses are quite different from our other interests 
our manufacturing businesses can be analyzed and valued by traditional measures of earnings and cash flow  and because they generate positive ongoing cash flow  they can be leveraged with borrowed funds 
our healthcare related operating company  therics  is a start up company active in drug delivery and tissue engineering 
on march   we announced our intent to divest therics 
efforts to sell therics are under way as it continues to progress in its technology development 
therics generates operating losses and negative cash flow in the form of net r d expenditures 
therics does not have licensed products to date  and revenues consist entirely of collaboration revenues r d support payments 
therics may never generate profits or positive cash flow 
if it were a stand alone  independent operation  it would typically be financed by private venture capital 
our investment subsidiary is comprised of high risk stakes in technology start up companies  primarily in the areas of communications  life sciences and information technology 
our primary objective in making these investments is to generate high after tax internal rates of return commensurate with the level of risk involved 
on october   we announced the retention of san francisco based probitas partners to explore alternatives aimed at maximizing the after tax values of our venture capital investments 
several alternatives are being considered  including the sale of substantially all of the portfolio in a secondary market transaction 
we hope to make an announcement regarding the status of our venture capital investments by march  in summary  we have a variety of business interests with dramatically different risk profiles  which makes the communication of operating results more difficult  especially since we have only one class of stock 
as a result  the segment information presented on pages and the business segment review on pages are critical to understanding our operating results and business risks 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies 
these policies require management to exercise judgments that are often difficult  subjective and complex due to the necessity of estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of investments we have investments in private venture capital fund limited partnerships and early stage technology companies  including the stock of privately held companies and the restricted and unrestricted stock of companies that have registered shares in initial public offerings 
these investments individually represent voting ownership interests of less than we write down or write off an investment and recognize a loss when events indicate there is impairment in the investment that is other than temporary 
for private securities and ownership interests in private venture capital funds  impairment is deemed to exist when the estimated fair value at quarterly valuation dates is below carrying value 
for available for sale securities  impairment is deemed to exist if analyst reports or other information on the company in which we have invested indicate that recovery of value above cost basis is unlikely within several quarters 
the fair value of securities of public companies is determined based on closing price quotations  subject to estimated restricted stock discounts 
we estimate the fair value of securities of private companies using purchase cost  prices of recent significant private placements of securities of the same issuer  changes in financial condition and prospects of the issuer  and estimates of liquidation value 
the fair value of ownership interests in private venture capital funds is based on our estimate of our distributable share of fund net assets using  among other information the respective funds general partners estimate of the fair value of non marketable securities held by the funds which is usually the indicative value from the latest round of financing or a reduced amount if events subsequent to the financing imply a lower valuation  closing bid prices of publicly traded securities held by the funds  subject to estimated restricted stock discounts  and fund formulas for allocating profits  losses and distributions 
because of the inherent uncertainty associated with the valuations of restricted securities or securities for which there is no public market  estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
the portfolio is subject to risks typically associated with investments in technology start up companies  which include business failure  illiquidity and stock market volatility 
furthermore  publicly traded stocks of emerging  technology based companies usually have higher volatility and risk than the us stock market as a whole 
we have also announced that we are exploring alternatives aimed at maximizing the after tax value of our venture capital investments 
among these alternatives is the sale of substantially all of the portfolio in a secondary market transaction 
recent industry transactions in the secondary market have been completed with significant discounts to reported fair value 
impairment of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill we regularly assess our long lived identifiable assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
any necessary impairment charges are recorded when we do not believe the carrying value of the long lived asset will be recoverable 
we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis 
we have made determinations as to what our reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill and intangible assets should be allocated to those reporting units 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors to determine if impairment tests are met or the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
based upon assessments performed during  we recorded asset impairment losses related to long lived identifiable assets of million 
the net book value of these assets prior to the impairment loss was million 
pension benefits we have noncontributory and contributory defined benefit pension plans that have significant net pension income developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension income recorded in future periods 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
in general  our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and vice versa 
we reduced our discount rate in from to due to the decline in market interest rates during the year 
a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of expense and vice versa 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will also serve to increase the amount of pension expense 
during  the value of our plan assets declined due to general market conditions 
based on recent market and economic conditions  we decreased our expected long term return on plan assets to from in estimating our pension income 
at december   the estimated accumulated benefit obligation related to certain plans exceeded the fair value of those plan assets 
this was due primarily to a decline in pension asset values caused by stock market declines and changes in actuarial assumptions 
as a result  we were required to recognize for certain pension plans a minimum pension liability and recorded a charge to equity of million  net of deferred taxes of million 
we currently expect net pension income to decline in by approximately million compared with we expect our minimum cash funding requirement to increase to about million in from million in deferred tax assets many deductions for tax return purposes cannot be taken until the expenses are actually paid  rather than when the expenses are recorded for book purposes 
a substantial portion of our deferred tax asset is attributable to write downs of our venture capital investments that are required for book purposes but are not yet allowed for tax purposes 
in these circumstances  we accrue for the tax benefit expected to be received in future years if  in our judgment  it is more likely than not that we will receive such benefits 
on a quarterly basis  we review our judgment regarding the likelihood the benefits of a deferred tax asset will be realized 
during the periodic reviews  we must consider a variety of factors  including the nature and amount of the tax income and expense items  the anticipated timing of the ability to utilize the asset  the current tax statutes and the projected future earnings 
we believe the realization of our deferred tax assets is reasonably assured 
if circumstances change and management determines it is no longer more likely than not that an asset will be utilized  an offsetting valuation reserve would be recorded to reduce the asset and net earnings in that period 
results of operations versus revenues 
net sales in decreased by to million compared with million in net sales were lower in both aluminum extrusions and film products 
the lower net sales in aluminum extrusions were due primarily to a decline in volume due to continued weak economic conditions  especially in our end markets 
volume in film products was down  however  the impact on net sales of lower overall volume was partially offset by revenue from volume shortfall payments

the gross profit margin during increased to from in  with higher margins realized in both film products and aluminum extrusions 
the margin improvement in film products was driven by higher sales of new higher margin products combined with volume shortfall payments 
the gross profit margin in aluminum extrusions was helped by the reduction of fixed costs that resulted primarily from the shutdown of our plant in el campo  texas 
sg a expenses in were million  compared with sg a expenses of million in the increase was primarily due to higher expenses in film products in support of additional marketing activities and personnel additions  particularly in europe and asia

net sales in decreased by to million compared with million in the lower net sales are due primarily to a decline in volume in aluminum extrusions of in due to adverse economic conditions and cyclical downturn in the end use markets we serve 
volume in film products was down slightly  however  the impact on net sales of lower overall volume in film products was offset by higher sales from operations in europe and china and higher sales of new higher value products 
net losses for tredegar investments totaled million million after income taxes in while in there were net gains of million million after income taxes

the gross profit margin during remained relatively flat at  with higher margins realized in film products offset by lower margins in aluminum extrusions 
the margin improvement in film products was driven by higher sales of new higher margin products 
the gross profit margin in film products in was negatively impacted by higher production costs associated with the commercialization of new products 
the gross profit margin erosion in aluminum extrusions was due primarily to lower volumes causing a decline in total variable contribution available to cover fixed manufacturing costs 
competitive pricing pressures also had an adverse impact

these decreases were partially offset by the following an increase in cash and cash equivalents up million  see cash flows on page  an increase in accounts receivable up million primarily attributable to receivables for volume shortfall payments and contract terminations and revisions in film products  and higher prepaid pension assets up million due to pension income recognized during the year of million partially offset by the net impact of an additional minimum pension liability and intangible asset for pensions of million

see note on page we believe our cash and cash equivalents at december   along with cash generated from continuing operations in will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs and our contractual obligations in from time to time  we enter into transactions with third parties in connection with the sale of assets or businesses in which we agree to indemnify the buyers or third parties involved in the sale for certain liabilities or risks related to the assets or business 
also  in the ordinary course of our business  we may enter into agreements with third parties for the sale of goods or services that may contain indemnification provisions 
in the event that an indemnification claim is asserted  liability for indemnification would be subject to an assessment of the underlying facts and circumstances under the terms of the applicable agreement 
further  any indemnification payments may be limited or barred by a monetary cap  a time limitation  or a deductible or basket 
for these reasons  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of the potential future liability under the indemnity provisions of these agreements 
we do  however  accrue for losses for any known contingent liability  including those that may arise from indemnification provisions  when future payment is probable 
we disclose contingent liabilities if the probability of loss is reasonably possible and significant

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tredegar has exposure to the volatility of interest rates  polyethylene and polypropylene resin prices  aluminum ingot and scrap prices  foreign currencies  emerging markets and technology stocks 
see note on page regarding credit agreements and interest rate exposures 
changes in resin prices  and the timing of those changes  could have a significant impact on profit margins in film products  however  those changes are generally followed by a corresponding change in selling prices 
profit margins in aluminum extrusions are sensitive to fluctuations in aluminum ingot and scrap prices  but fluctuations are also generally followed by a corresponding change in selling prices  however  there is no assurance that higher ingot costs can be passed along to customers 
in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales contracts with certain customers for the sale of fixed quantities of aluminum extrusions at scheduled intervals 
in order to hedge our exposure to aluminum price volatility under these fixed price arrangements  which generally have a duration of not more than twelve months  we enter into a combination of forward purchase commitments and futures contracts to acquire or hedge aluminum  based on the scheduled deliveries 
see note on page for more information 
we sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign operations and through exports from us plants 
the percentage of sales and total assets for manufacturing operations related to foreign markets for and are as follows tredegar corporation manufacturing operations percentage of net sales and total assets related to foreign markets of total net sales total assets foreign oper ations of total net sales total assets foreign oper ations exports from us foreign oper ations exports from us foreign oper ations canada europe latin america asia total exposure to foreign markets the percentages for foreign markets are relative to tredegar s total net sales  and total assets from manufacturing operations consolidated net sales and total assets from continuing operations excluding cash and cash equivalents  therics  venture capital investment activities and unusual items 
we attempt to match the pricing and cost of our products in the same currency and generally view the volatility of foreign currencies and emerging markets  and the corresponding impact on earnings and cash flow  as part of the overall risk of operating in a global environment 
exports from the us are generally denominated in us dollars 
we believe that our exposure to the canadian dollar has been substantially neutralized by the us dollar based spread the difference between selling prices and aluminum costs generated from canadian casting operations and exports from canada to the us we have investments in private venture capital fund limited partnerships and early stage technology companies  including the stock of privately held companies and the restricted and unrestricted stock of companies that have recently registered shares in initial public offerings 
the portfolio is subject to risks typically associated with investments in technology start up companies  which include business failure  illiquidity and stock market volatility 
furthermore  publicly traded stocks of emerging  technology based companies have higher volatility and risk than the us stock market as a whole

forward looking and cautionary statements from time to time  we may make statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on our then current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those addressed in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to the following general future performance is influenced by costs incurred by film products and aluminum extrusions 
there is no assurance that cost control efforts will positively impact results or that such efforts could be increased to a level that offsets any additional future declines in revenue 
film products film products is highly dependent on sales associated with one customer  p g 
p g comprised of our net sales in  in and in the loss or significant reduction of sales associated with p g would have a material adverse effect on our business  as would delays in p g rolling out products utilizing new technologies developed by tredegar 
while we have undertaken efforts to expand our customer base  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful  or that they will offset any delay or loss of sales and profits associated with p g 
see the business segment review beginning on page for a discussion regarding the loss of p g s domestic diaper backsheet business 
growth of film products depends on our ability to develop and deliver new products  especially in the personal care market  which comprised over of film products net sales in each of the last three years 
personal care products are now being made with a variety of new materials  replacing traditional backsheet and other components 
while we have substantial technical resources  there can be no assurance that our new products can be brought to market successfully  or if brought to market successfully  at the same level of profitability and market share of replaced films 
a shift in customer preferences away from our technologies  our inability to develop and deliver new profitable products  or delayed acceptance of our new products in domestic or foreign markets  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
film products operates in a field where our significant customers and competitors have substantial intellectual property portfolios 
the continued success of this business depends on our ability not only to protect our own technologies and trade secrets  but also to develop and sell new products that do not infringe upon existing patents 
although we are not currently involved in any patent litigation  the outcome of any such action could have a significant adverse impact on film products 
as film products expands its personal care business  we have greater credit risk that is inherent in broadening our customer base 
aluminum extrusions sales volume and profitability of aluminum extrusions is cyclical and highly dependent on economic conditions of end use markets in the united states and canada  particularly in the construction  distribution and transportation industries 
our market segments are also subject to seasonal slowdowns during the winter months 
from to the second quarter of  profits in aluminum extrusions grew as a result of positive economic conditions in the markets we serve and manufacturing efficiencies 
however  a slowdown in these markets in the second half of resulted in a decline in sales volume and decline in ongoing operating profit compared with the second half of the aluminum extrusions industry continued to be affected by poor economic conditions in and our sales volume declined and operating profit declined in compared with in  our sales volume declined and operating profit declined compared with the decline in ongoing operating profit at approximately two to three times the rate of the decline in sales volume illustrates the operating leverage inherent in our operations fixed operating costs 
any benefits associated with cost reductions and productivity improvements may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effects on profitability from pricing and margin pressure and higher bad debts that usually accompany a downturn 
the markets for our products are highly competitive with product quality  service and price being the principal competitive factors 
as competitors increase capacity or reduce prices to increase business  there could be pressure to reduce prices to our customers 
aluminum extrusions is under increasing domestic and foreign competitive pressures  including a growing presence of chinese imports in a number of markets 
this competition could result in loss of market share due to competitor s ability to produce at lower costs and sell at lower prices 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain current margins and profitability 
our continued success and prospects depend on our ability to retain existing customers and participate in overall industry cross cycle growth 
therics we are attempting to sell therics  but given the current market conditions in the biotechnology sector  there is no assurance that we will be successful in those efforts 
we will continue to incur losses as we support therics operations during the sale process 
there is no assurance we will realize any return on our continuing investment in therics 
therics has incurred losses since inception  and we are unsure when  or if  it will become profitable 
we have not brought any drug delivery systems or bone replacement products to commercialization 
there can be no assurance that any new drug delivery systems or bone replacement products can be brought to market successfully 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the fda and other regulatory authorities will clear our products in a timely manner 
our ability to develop and commercialize products will depend on our ability to internally develop preclinical  clinical  regulatory and sales and marketing capabilities  or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide those functions 
we may not be successful in developing these capabilities or entering into agreements with third parties on favorable terms 
further  our reliance upon third parties for these capabilities could reduce our control over such activities and could make us dependent upon these parties 
our inability to develop or contract for these capabilities would significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize products 
we are highly dependent on several principal members of our management and scientific staff 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on therics business and results of operations  and could inhibit product development and commercialization efforts 
in addition  recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform future r d work is critical to our success 
competition for experienced scientists is intense 
failure to recruit and retain executive management and scientific personnel on acceptable terms could prevent us from achieving our business objectives 
the patent positions of biotechnology firms generally are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions that can determine who has the right to develop a particular product 
no clear policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims covered by biotechnology patents in the united states 
the biotechnology patent situation outside the united states is even more uncertain and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries 
changes in  or different interpretations of  patent laws in the united states and other countries might allow others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our products without any compensation to us 
tredegar investments tredegar s efforts to maximize the after tax value of its venture capital investments could result in the sale of substantially all of the portfolio in the secondary market 
recent industry transactions in the secondary market have been completed with significant discounts to reported fair value 
if tredegar does not dispose of a substantial portion of its venture capital portfolio by the end of  it will foregosignificant tax benefits that would be available from the carry back of possible capital losses 
the success  continued existence and value of the early stage technology companies in which we invest depends on their ability to create or develop commercially viable products or businesses  and raise additional capital when needed 
the possibility that companies in which we invest will not be able to meet their milestones or commercialize their technology  product or business concept presents significant risk 
additionally  companies in which we make seed or expansion round investments will often require substantial additional equity financing to satisfy continuing working capital requirements 
each round of venture financing is typically intended to provide a company with only enough capital to reach the next stage of development 
we cannot predict the circumstances or market conditions under which the companies in which we invest will seek additional capital  however  current market conditions are not favorable 
companies that are unsuccessful in raising the needed additional capital are likely to fail  leaving little or no liquidation value for investors 
the success of our venture capital investments will be significantly affected by the state of the securities markets in general and  more specifically  the market for initial public offerings  the market for communications  life science and information technology companies  and the market for mergers and acquisitions 
if we do not sell substantially all of the portfolio in the secondary market  we anticipate that a significant portion of our returns will be realized through initial public offerings of companies in which we have invested or through merger and acquisition activity 
the market for initial public offerings and merger and acquisition activity is cyclical in nature 
thus  we cannot be certain that the securities markets will be receptive to initial public offerings or merger and acquisition activity  particularly those of early stage companies 
as seen during and  any adverse change in the market for initial public offerings could significantly impact our ability to realize our investment objective 
additionally  once a company becomes publicly traded  there is generally a period of time in which we are not permitted to trade the securities the lock up period  which is generally six months 
valuing our venture capital investments is difficult and inexact 
our venture capital portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in private securities 
the valuation of these securities is inherently subjective  and the estimated fair values reported by management might not reflect the price at which the securities could be sold in the open market 
recent transactions on the sale of venture capital portfolios in the secondary market have been completed at significant discounts to reported fair value

business segment review film products sales 
sales in film products were million in  versus million in sales in include revenue related to volume shortfall payments of million versus volume shortfall payments of million in while we continue to have volume shortfall agreements in place for certain products  the majority of payments received in relate to older supply agreements for which volume commitments have expired 
we do not expect to receive significant revenues from volume shortfall payments in total volume for the year declined to million pounds from million pounds in our domestic backsheet business has been declining since  when domestic backsheet sales to p g and other customers were million 
domestic backsheet sales in were million 
during and  we were successful in offsetting the negative impact of this decline by commercializing new diaper and feminine hygiene components for a growing global customer base 
during the third quarter of  we stated that we expected the decline in domestic backsheet business to accelerate in the near term 
at that time  we were uncertain as to the timing and financial impact of the decline 
the potential loss of domestic backsheet business has since been clarified and during the fourth quarter of  we learned that we would be losing additional backsheet business from p g 
sales related to discontinued p g domestic backsheet business totaled approximately million in these sales should be fully eliminated by the end of the first quarter of while we continue to sell backsheet products on a global basis  and we are actively competing for new business with various customers  our growth strategy is based on the ongoing development of new products  primarily apertured and elastic materials for global personal care markets 
we have established sales and product development relationships with all of the major global producers of diapers and sanitary napkins as well as most regional and private label manufacturers 
we are developing several new personal care products for customers that are expected to generate significant revenue beginning in for example  our new apertured topsheet product for p g s sanitary napkin business is currently being introduced in europe  and we expect further growth from other personal care products 
film products sales were million in versus million in total volume for declined to million pounds from million pounds down 
the decline in volume was primarily due to lower demand for our diaper backsheet film 
the impact of the volume decline on net sales was offset by higher sales from operations in europe and china and higher sales of new  higher value specialty film components for diapers and feminine hygiene products 
operating profit 
operating profit in film products was million in  up from million in operating profit in includes goodwill amortization expense of million 
operating profit in also includes the benefit of volume shortfall payments of million and a net gain from unusual items of million in connection with terminations and revisions of supply contracts with p g and related asset write downs 
these items are summarized in the following table in millions operating profit as reported volume shortfall payments unusual items gain loss on terminations and revisions of contracts with p g proceeds from contract terminations and revisions related asset write downs gain loss on terminations and revisions of contracts with p g other unusual items total gain loss from unusual items operating profit excluding volume shortfall payments and unusual items excluding the impact of volume shortfall payments and unusual items  operating profit was million compared with million in given our rapidly changing product mix  forecasting is very difficult 
when we look ahead to the first and second quarters of  we expect operating profit to be around million per quarter 
we expect continued growth from new products and cost reductions to have a growing impact on profits as the year progresses 
by the end of  we should be positioned to resume growth in both sales and profits during film products operating profit  excluding the impact of volume shortfall payments and unusual items  was million in  up from million in the improvement in operating profit was due to growth in foreign operations  including higher profits in europe up million  including million due to a full year of operations for adma and promea  and china up million partially offset by lower profits in brazil and argentina down million  a shift away from our diaper backsheet film to higher margin specialty film components for diapers and feminine hygiene products  and a reduction in charges for bad debts and returned goods impact of million 
identifiable assets 
identifiable assets in film products increased to million at december   from million at december  due primarily to the impact of the following an increase in accounts receivable of million primarily due to receivables of million related to amounts due for terminations and revisions of contracts and volume shortfalls  and an increase in other assets of million primarily due to an increase in the pension asset due to pension income 
the increase in identifiable assets was partially offset by a decrease in net property  plant and equipment of million resulting from asset write downs due to impairment losses of million offset by capital expenditures in excess of depreciation of million 
identifiable assets in film products were million at december  compared with million at december  while overall identifiable assets did not change significantly between years  growth opportunities in foreign markets combined with excess capacity in domestic plants resulted in a shift of assets from domestic to foreign locations 
consequently  identifiable assets increased in europe up million and china up million while declining in the united states down million 
identifiable assets declined in brazil and argentina down million on a combined basis due primarily to asset write downs in argentina resulting from deteriorating business and economic conditions 
depreciation  amortization and capital expenditures 
depreciation and amortization for film products was million in  down from million in the required adoption of a new accounting standard effective january   resulted in the elimination of goodwill amortization in of approximately million 
this was offset slightly by higher depreciation due to fixed asset additions 
depreciation and amortization was million in  down slightly from million in due to plant rationalizations 
capital expenditures in film products in totaled million and reflect the normal replacement of machinery and equipment and machinery and equipment to upgrade the lines at our plant in kerkrade  the netherlands  machinery and equipment purchased for a new production line at our plant in kerkrade  the netherlands  machinery and equipment for a new production line at our plant in terre haute  indiana  and expansion of capacity at our plant in shanghai  china 
capital expenditures in totaled million and reflect the normal replacement of machinery and equipment and a new manufacturing facility in shanghai  china  continued expansion of manufacturing capacity at our plant in retsag  hungary  machinery and equipment purchased for a new production line at our plant in terre haute  indiana  and machinery and equipment purchased to upgrade lines at our plant in kerkrade  the netherlands 
aluminum extrusions sales 
sales in aluminum extrusions were million in  down from million in annual volume was million pounds compared with million pounds in business conditions in our end markets continue to be difficult  and we expect continued pressure on both volume and selling prices see our market segments in the table on page 
sales declined to million in compared with million in annual volume declined to million pounds from million pounds in poor economic conditions in had a negative impact on both volume and sales 
operating profit 
operating profit in aluminum extrusions  excluding unusual items  was million in  an increase of over operating profit of million 
while volume had a negative impact on operating profit  this was more than offset by lower conversion costs  which were helped by the reduction of fixed costs from the shutdown of our aluminum plant in el campo  texas 
in addition  our superior quality and customer service are helping us to alleviate some of the pricing pressure we are facing 
until we see signs of an upturn in the economy  it is difficult to forecast any improvements in operating profit 
in the meantime  we will continue to focus aggressively on customer service and cost reduction opportunities 
operating profit  excluding unusual items  declined to million in compared with million in due to the decline in volume and pricing pressure related to weak economic conditions 
identifiable assets 
identifiable assets in aluminum extrusions were million at december   versus million at december  the decrease is primarily related to property  plant and equipment due to depreciation in excess of capital expenditures of million 
identifiable assets in aluminum extrusions were million at december   down from million at december  the decrease is primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable and inventory reflecting lower sales combined decrease of million  and an impairment charge to property  plant and equipment of million related to the closure of the plant in el campo  texas 
depreciation  amortization and capital expenditures 
depreciation and amortization for aluminum extrusions was million in  down slightly from million in the required adoption of a new accounting standard effective january   resulted in the elimination of goodwill amortization of  also contributing to the decline in depreciation expense was the shutdown of our plant in el campo  texas 
depreciation and amortization for aluminum extrusions was million in  up from million in due primarily to capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in totaled million and reflect the normal replacement of machinery and equipment  primarily at our aluminum plants in kentland  indiana  and carthage  tennessee

the tangible assets were sold during the fourth quarter for proceeds of  tredegar investments on october   we announced the retention of san francisco based probitas partners to explore alternatives aimed at maximizing the after tax value of our venture capital investments 
several alternatives are being considered  including the sale of substantially all of the portfolio in a secondary market transaction 
we hope to make an announcement concerning our venture capital investments by march  recent industry transactions in the secondary market have been completed with significant discounts to reported fair value 
the ultimate after tax value of the portfolio under a hold strategy is uncertain
