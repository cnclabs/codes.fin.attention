critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions  upon which we rely  are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that they are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements may be affected 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
we have identified the policies listed below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition 
a substantial portion of our company s contracts are billed on a time and materials basis 
revenues pursuant to time and materials contracts are generally recognized as services are provided 
revenues pursuant to fixed price contracts are generally recognized as services are rendered using the percentage of completion method of accounting  based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the number  size and scope of projects in which we are engaged  the contractual terms and degree of completion of such projects  any delays incurred in connection with a project  employee utilization rates  the adequacy of holdback reserves  the use of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  general economic conditions and other factors 
certain significant estimates include percentage of completion estimates used for fixed price contracts and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
these items are frequently monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances and the effect  if any  on prior estimates 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets

we consider scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters  including the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable in assessing the need for and the amount of the valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  adjustments to the deferred tax assets may be recorded  which could materially impact our financial position and net income loss in the period
