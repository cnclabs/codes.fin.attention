we sell our services and products to cruise passengers and  commencing as of july  at day and resort spas primarily in the united states  the caribbean  the pacific and asia 
payments to cruise lines and resort spa owners are based on a percentage of our passenger revenues and  in certain cases  a minimum annual rental or a combination of both 
from february through january  we offered services and products similar to those we offer on cruise ships at the luxury spa at the atlantis resort on paradise island in the bahamas

in the fourth quarter of  the company determined to sell or otherwise dispose of most of its day spa operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
the operating results of the day spa segment  excluding the day spas that are not being disposed of  are reported in discontinued operations and the remaining assets and liabilities are classified as assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and additionally  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to adjust the carrying value of the related assets and liabilities to their estimated fair value for the year ended december  this impairment charge was estimated based on day spas that were disposed of in  the disposition  or other closing of day spas that have closed subsequent to year end and the terms of transactions that are currently being negotiated 
as a result  the amount of the impairment charge may change based upon the ultimate terms of the disposition of these day spas

critical accounting policies we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the impact on our business operations and any associated risks related to these policies is discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  beginning on page f our preparation of this form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
cost of revenues includes cost of services  including an allocable portion of wages paid to shipboard and land based spa employees  payments to cruise lines and land based spa lessors and other staff related shipboard expenses  spa facilities depreciation  as well as  with respect to our schools  directly attributable campus costs such as rent and employee wages  and cost of products  including an allocable portion of wages paid to shipboard and land based spa employees  payments to cruise lines and land based spa lessors and other staff related shipboard expenses  as well as costs associated with development  manufacturing and distribution of products 
cost of revenues may be affected by  among other things  sales mix  production levels  exchange rates  changes in supplier prices and discounts  purchasing and manufacturing efficiencies  tariffs  duties  freight and inventory costs 
certain cruise line agreements provide for increases in the percentages of services and products revenues payable as payments and or  as the case may be  the amount of minimum annual line commissions over the terms of such agreements 
these payments may also be increased under new agreements with cruise lines and land based lessors that replace expiring agreements 
in general  we have experienced increases in these payments as a percentage of revenues upon entering into new agreements with cruise lines 
cost of products includes the cost of products sold through our various methods of distribution 
to a lesser extent  cost of products also includes the cost of products consumed in rendering services 
this amount would not be a material component of the cost of services rendered and would not be practicable to identify separately 
operating expenses include administrative expenses  salary and payroll taxes 
in addition  operating expenses include amortization of intangibles relating to our acquisitions of resort spas in property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets in question 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
for certain properties  leasehold improvements are amortized over the lease term which includes renewal periods that may be obtained at our option  that are considered significant to the continuation of our operations and to the existence of leasehold improvements whose value would be impaired by our discontinuing use of the leased property 
we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset  industry practice and asset maintenance policies 
maintenance and repair items are expensed as incurred 
goodwill we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on january  we had recorded approximately  of amortization on these amounts for the year ended december  and would have recorded approximately  of amortization during the same period in in lieu of amortization for  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill and an annual impairment review thereafter 
during the second quarter of  we completed our assessment of our intangible assets and wrote off million of intangible assets 
those intangibles primarily consisted of goodwill related to our july acquisitions of the greenhouse and c 
spa day spa chains 
the write off has been accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and has been recorded effective january  as of december   we had unamortized goodwill and intangibles of mi llion 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves our estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessment temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million which includes million related to our discontinued operations as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses carried forward before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  business combinations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 business combinations and sfas  accounting for pre acquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
all business combinations in the scope of sfas are to be accounted for under the purchase method 
sfas was effective july  our acquisitions of the mandara spa and greenhouse and c 
spa day spa chains were accounted for under the provisions of sfas the adoption of sfas with respect to acquisitions made prior to july  did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
all intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  and assigned values in connection with pre july  acquisitions meet the recognition criteria specified by sfas and  therefore  will co ntinue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in june  fasb also issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination at acquisition 
sfas also addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
with the adoption of sfas  impairment is determined by applying a fair value based test 
the impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying or book value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  impairment loss for goodwill arising from the initial application of sfas is to be reported as resulting from a change in accounting principle 
during the second quarter  we completed our assessment of our intangible assets and wrote off million of intangible assets 
those intangibles pr imarily consisted of goodwill related to our july acquisitions of the greenhouse and c 
spa day spa chains 
the write off has been accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and has been recorded effective january in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  the company is required to adopt this statement in the first quarter of we do not believe adoption of this statement will materially impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
on january   the company adopted sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas also amends arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
sfas provides more guidance on estimating cash flows when performing a recoverability test  requires that a long lived asset or asset group  principally consisting of property  plant and equipment  to be disposed of other than by sale eg  abandoned be classified as held and used until it is disposed of  requires revision of the depreciable life of a long lived asset to be abandoned and establishes more restrictive criteria to classify an asset or asset group as held for sale 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report beginning on page f for discussion of impairment losses recognized in in july  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf relates to sfas no 
s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion reached by fasb in this statement is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that mee ts the definition of a liability 
therefore  sfas no eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the effective date of the sfas no 
is january   with earlier adoption encouraged 
in connection with the discontinued operations  the company early adopted sfas no 
in the effects of this adoption are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report beginning on page f in november  fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others the interpretation 
the interpretation applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying contract that is related to an asset  liability or an equity security of the guaranteed party 
the interpretation s disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the interpretation s initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the company adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation in this report 
the company does not believe that adoption of the initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of the interpretation will materially impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
the disclosure required by the interpretation is set forth in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report beginning on page f on december   fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure statement 
statement amends financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement  to provide alternative methods of transition to statement s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
statement also amends the disclosure provisions of statement and accounting principals board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosures in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
statement does not amend statement to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method 
the company adopted the disclosure provisions required in statement and has provided the necessary disclosures within note o to the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report beginning on page f in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a variable interest entity is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
the company believes the adoption of fin will not impact the company s financial position or results of operations

revenues increased approximately  or million  to million in from million in of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in services revenues and million was attributable to an increase in products revenues 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributed to the land based operations we acquired in the third quarter of and to an average of nine additional spa ships in service in compared to the increase was also attributable to the significant decrease in travel in the weeks following the terrorists attacks of september   which abated to a significant extent in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues at our massage therapy schools due to lower enrollments

cost of products 
cost of products increased million from million in to million in cost of products as a percentage of products revenue decreased to in from in this decrease was due to increased efficiency at our manufacturing facility that was partially offset by increases in commissions allocable to products sales on cruise ships covered by agreements which provide for increases in payments in compared to operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million from million in to million in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in the decrease was due to a decrease in goodwill amortization as the result of the impact of a new accounting principle and the effect of the relatively small administrative overhead relating to the land based operations that were acquired in the third quarter of the decrease was partially offset by an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts at the massage therapy schools  the results of which were exacerbated by the weak economic conditions and an increase in intangible amortization of our land based operations that were acquired in the third quarter of other income expense 
other income expense decreased million from expense of million in to expense of million in this decrease was due to the increase in interest expense in as a result of our debt financing obligations  under the credit agreement which we entered into in connection with our july acquisitions  which was not in place during all of  and a reduction in interest income due to reduced cash balances in provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased million from million in to million in the provision for income taxes increased to an overall effective rate of for from an overall effective rate of for primarily due to the income earned in jurisdictions that tax our income increasing to a greater extent than our income earned in jurisdictions that do not tax our income and a tax benefit that was recorded in for a refund for taxes paid in prior years that did not occur in loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
the loss from discontinued operations increased million from million in to million in this increase was attributed to a million loss on disposal that was recorded in the fourth quarter of with respect to the disposition of most of our day spa operations which commenced in that quarter and a million loss from operations attributable to a full year of operations of those day spas in  compared to a partial year in as a result of the acquisition of the day spas in the third quarter of cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during the second quarter  in accordance with sfas  we wrote off million in intangible assets 
these intangibles primarily consist of goodwill related to our july acquisitions of the greenhouse day spa and c 
spa chains 
the write off has been accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and has been recorded effective january  compared to revenues 
revenues increased approximately  or million  to million in from million in of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in services revenues and million was attributable to an increase in products revenues 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the land based operations we acquired in july and to an average of six additional spa ships in service in compared to this increase was partially offset by the impact of the terrorist attacks of september  which caused a decline in the number of cruise passengers and a decline in the number of customers at our spas  and the bankruptcy filing by renaissance cruises

operating expenses increased million from million in to million in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in as a result of the operating expenses and intangible amortization at our newly acquired land based operations which were not owned by us in provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased million from million in to million in the provision for income taxes decreased to an overall effective rate of in from an overall effective rate of in primarily due to the income earned in jurisdictions that do not tax our income being increasing at a greater rate than our income earned in jurisdictions that tax our income and a tax benefit that was recorded in for a refund for taxes paid in prior years that did not occur in loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
the loss from discontinued operations with respect to our day spas was million in the day spas were acquired in the third quarter of as a result  there was no loss from discontinued operations in quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data on a quarterly basis for and and the percentage of revenues represented by the line items presented 
certain cruise lines  and  as a result  steiner leisure  have experienced moderate seasonality 
however  we believe that the introduction of cruise ships into service throughout a year has mitigated the effect of seasonality on our results of operations 
in addition  decreased passenger loads during slower months for the cruise industry has not had a significant impact on our revenues 
however  due to our dependence on the cruise industry  steiner leisure s revenues may in the future be more significantly effected by seasonality 
the quarterly selected statements of operations data set forth below were derived from the unaudited consolidated financial statements of steiner leisure excludes the day spa segment  which is reported in discontinued operations which  in the opinion of our management  contai n all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of those statements

effective january   the operator of the atlantis resort exercised its option to buy out the remaining term of our lease and  as a result  effective january  we no longer offered our services and products at the atlantis spa 
in connection with that buy out we received million from the operator of the atlantis resort and did not recognize any gain or loss 
commencing in july  with our acquisition of a interest in mandara spa  we began again to offer products and services at the atlantis spa 
in october  steiner leisure entered into an agreement to build and operate a luxury spa facility at the aladdin resort and casino in las vegas  nevada 
that luxury spa opened in november the term of the lease of the facility is years with a five year renewal option if certain sales levels are achieved 
the build out of the luxury spa cost approximately million 
the build out was funded from our working capital and a term loan 
the operator of the aladdin resort and casino has filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code and continues to conduct its operations 
we have taken steps in the bankruptcy court to protect our leasehold interest at the resort 
however  we cannot assure you that our operations at the aladdin resort and casino will not be adversely affected by aladdin s bankruptcy filing 
in july  the company purchased a equity interest in each of mandara spa llc and mandara spa asia limited collectively  referred to as mandara spa 
mandara spa operates spas in more than locations worldwide  principally in asia and the pacific  the united states and the caribbean 
mandara spa also provides spa services for silversea cruises  norwegian cruise line and orient lines 
effective march   we acquired an additional approximately interest in mandara spa llc for consideration of approximately million in cash 
additionally  effective december   we acquired the remaining interests in mandara spa llc and mandara spa asia in exchange for a total of  of our common shares  valued at approximately million 
this amount represents the funding that was required to complete the build out of certain luxury spa facilities under the mandara name 
in connection with the mandara spa acquisition  the company paid million in cash including million in transaction costs  million in subordinated debt  million in common shares and assumed million of subordinated indebtedness and the selling equity holders have guaranteed certain income levels for an month period 
if the income levels are not achieved  then  amounts owed on the subordinated debt are reduced on a pro rata basis 
we issued to the selling equity holders subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of  and which have an interest rate of per annum and a maturity date of january  the notes 
the notes are subordinate in right of payment to steiner s senior credit facility 
interest on the million of the notes issued to the former shareholders of mandara spa asia limited the mandara asia notes accrues  and is payable  quarterly 
interest on the million of the notes issued to the former members of mandara spa llc the mandara us notes accrues quarterly  but is payable on the maturity date 
amounts due under th e notes both principal and interest must be earned by mandara spa llc and or mandara spa asia limited  as applicable  by generating income in the post acquisition period 
interest on the mandara us notes is not payable until the end of the earnout period 
hence  if not earned  no interest or principal will be due on these notes 
interest on the mandara asia notes accrues  and is payable  quarterly 
however  if mandara spa asia limited fails to meet the earnout threshold  all interest payments previously paid to the former shareholders of mandara spa asia limited are required to be repaid to steiner by such former shareholders 
because principal and interest due under the mandara us notes  and the repayment of principal of the mandara asia notes are not payable until after the settlement of the earnout contingency  and if the earnout is not met  the notes are cancelable and any interest payments previously paid to the former shareholders of mandara spa asia limited will be repaid to steiner  steine r has not recorded any purchase price goodwill related to the notes 
when the contingency is resolved  the settlement amount of the notes and related interest  if any  will be recorded as a component of the purchase price 
as of december   in connection with the earnout  approximately million in principal and  of interest is due under the mandara us notes and million in principal and  of interest is due under the mandara asia notes 
in accordance with sfas  these amounts have been recorded as a component of the purchase price 
in connection with our acquisition of mandara spas we incurred approximately million in costs from july through march in connection with the completion of the build out of certain luxury spa facilities to be operated under the mandara name 
in july  the company purchased the assets of the greenhouse day spa chain and other related entities  which assets  collectively  constituted eleven luxury day spas located at various locations within the united states  and the greenhouse mark 
in connection with that transaction  the company paid million in cash and million in common shares 
in addition  million of common shares  and  options in common shares could be earned by the sellers if certain income levels are obtained through in july  the company purchased the shares of dk partners  inc  which operated six day spas located in california 
in connection with that transaction  the company paid million in cash and assumed million of indebtedness 
in addition  million in cash can be earned by the sellers if certain income levels are obtained 
these transactions were accounted for under the purchase method 
in order to finance these acquisitions  in july  the company entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for a term loan of million and a revolving credit facility of up to million 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and bear interest primarily at london interbank offered rate libor based rates plus a spread that is dependent upon the company s financial performance 
borrowings under the term loan were used to fund acquisitions and under the revolving facility have been used for working capital needs 
as of march   million was outstanding under the term loan and approximately million was outstanding under the revolving facility 
at march   the effective rates on the term loan and revolving facility were approximately and  respectively 
the credit agreement contains customary affirmative  negative and financial covenants  including limitations on dividends  capital expenditures and funded debt  and requirements to maintain prescribed interest expense and fixed charge coverage ratios 
as of december   the company was either in compliance or had received waivers of any non compliance related to these covenants 
other limitations on capital expenditures  or on other operational matters  could apply in the future 
also  the recent amendment to our credit facility provided us with partial relief with respect to principal payments for the first quarter of a result of that relief is that we will be required to use a portion of our cash flow to make interest payments with respect to that unpaid principal 
effective september   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce its exposure to market risks from changing interest rates 
under the swap agreement  the company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional principal amount 
any differences paid or received on interest rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense over the life of each swap  thereby adjusting the effective interest rate on the underlying obligation 
the company does not hold or issue such financial instruments for trading purposes 
derivatives used for hedging purposes must be designated as  and effective as  a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract 
the interest rate swap has a notional amount of million as of december  and matures on september  the interest rate swap agreement effectively converts a portion of the company s libor based variable rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings with a pay rate of 
the company recorded a loss of  and a gain of  in accumulated other comprehensive losses in and  respectively 
we reclassified losses of  and  related to the interest rate swap into interest expense in and  respectively 
in july  we purchased the assets of the greenhouse day spa business 
as a result  we acquired luxury day spas under the greenhouse name at various locations in the united states and acquired the greenhouse mark 
also in july  we purchased c 
spa  which operated six day spas in california 
we opened an additional greenhouse day spa in february in the fourth quarter of  we decided to dispose of  or otherwise close  of those day spas 
the remaining day spa is located at a hotel and is continuing to operate as part of our resort spa operations 
in that quarter  we began negotiations with potential third party acquirers of the assets of those day spas as well as with landlords at the shopping centers and other venues where those day spas are located 
as of march   of those day spas had been closed pursuant to agreements with landlords and or  in some cases  agreements with third party acquirers of the spas assets  including the leases 
in addition  we are in negotiations with landlords and a proposed acquirer of the assets assignee of the lease with respect to the remaining four day spas to be disposed of 
these transactions involved our paying to those landlords amounts representing various portions of the remaining terms of the leases involved 
in the transactions involving transfers of spa assets and assignments of the leases  we typically have been required to make payments to those acquirers in consideration of their assuming both the lease in question and certain gift certificate liabilities related to the spas in question 
the lease assignments to third parties generally do not include a release from the landlords of the spas in question and  accordingly  to the extent that these third parties fail to pay rent under the leases  we would remain liable for that rent 
we would  in those instances  have a cause of action for such rental amounts against those third parties 
the total amount that we remain liable for under such assigned leases  if the assignees fail to make the payments that they are required to make  is approximately million 
our loss on disposal in connection with these discontinued operations is estimated to be approximately million in our loss on operations in connection with these discontinued operations is approximately million for additional losses on disposal and operations will be incurred in  but the amounts thereof are not currently known 
if the transactions for the disposition of the remaining day spas are not completed on the terms currently proposed  that loss could increase 
in addition  in connection with these discontinued operations  we anticipate that celeste dunn  president and chief executive officer of our steiner day spas  inc subsidiary  will be terminating her employment with us 
in connection with that termination  ms 
dunn may be entitled to receive a severance payment of  ms 
dunn has also requested compensation in addition to that amount as well as the termination of her non competition arrangement in connection with her departure 
any am ounts paid will be included in the loss on discontinued operations for no agreement has yet been reached with ms 
dunn on this matter 
in  we purchased a total of approximately million of our common shares in the open market 
the cash used to make such purchases was funded from our working capital 
these purchases were made pursuant to a share purchase program authorized by our board of directors 
we believe that cash generated from operations is sufficient to satisfy the cash required to operate our current business for the next months 
to the extent there is a significant slow down in travel resulting from terrorist attacks  the war in iraq  other hostilities  or any other reasons  cash generated from operations may not satisfy the cash required to operate our business 
in that case we would need outside financing which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
inflation and economic conditions steiner leisure does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on revenues or results of operations 
however  public demand for activities  including cruises  is influenced by general economic conditions  including inflation 
periods of economic recession or high inflation  particularly in north america where a substantial number of cruise passengers reside  could have a material adverse effect on the cruise industry upon which we are dependent 
the current softness of the economy in north america and over capacity in the cruise industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements include the following our dependence on cruise line concession agreements of specified terms that are  in some cases  terminable by cruise lines with limited or no advance notice under certain circumstances  our dependence on the cruise industry and the resort industry and our being subject to the risks of those industries  including operation of facilities in countries with histories of economic and or political instability  economic downturns that could reduce the number of customers on cruise ships and at resorts and that could otherwise reduce consumer demand for our products and services and the continuing effect on the economy in general and the travel and leisure segment in particular of the events of september   the war in iraq and the threat of future terrorist attacks and armed hostilities  our dependence on a limited number of cruise companies and further consolidation of companies in the cruise industry  our obligation to make minimum payments to certain cruise lines and lessors of land based spas  irrespective of the revenues received by us from customers  increases in payments accompanying renewals of expiring cruise line agreements and land based spa agreements  or the securing of new agreements  our dependence on the continued viability of the cruise lines we serve and the resorts where we operate our land based spas  delays in new ship introductions and unscheduled withdrawals from service of ships we serve  the effects of outbreaks of illnesses on cruise ships or in locations where our resort spas are located  the possible increasing effects of seasonality on our business  our dependence for success on our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel  our dependence on a single product manufacturer  changes in the taxation of our bahamas subsidiaries and increased amounts of our income being subject to taxation  changing competitive conditions  including increased competition from providers of shipboard spa services  our limited experience in land based operations including with respect to the integration of acquired businesses  risks relating to our non us operations  uncertainties beyond our control that could affect our ability to timely and cost effectively construct land based spa facilities  changes in laws and government regulations applicable to us and the cruise industry  product liability or other claims against us by customers of our products or services  currency risk  restrictions imposed on us as a result of our credit facility  and our need to seek additional financing and the risk that such refinancing may not be available on satisfactory terms  or at all 
these risks and other risks are detailed in the section of this report entitled certain factors that may affect future operating results 
that section contains important cautionary statements and a discussion of many of the factors that could materially affect the accuracy of our forward looking statements and or adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial position 
forward looking statements should not be relied upon as predictions of actual results 
subject to any continuing obligations under applicable law  we expressly disclaim any obligation to disseminate  after the date of this report  any updates or revisions to any such forward looking statements to reflect any change in expectations or events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statements are based 
certain factors that may affect future operating results in addition to the other information set forth  or incorporated by reference in this report  you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating steiner leisure and its business 
we depend on our agreements with cruise lines and resorts 
if these agreements terminate  our business would be harmed our revenues are generated principally on cruise ships 
under our agreements with cruise lines  we provide services and products paid for by cruise passengers 
the cruise line agreements have specific terms  ranging from one to six years with an average remaining term per ship  as of march   of approximately two years 
as of that date  cruise line agreements that expire within one year covered ten of the ships served by us 
these ten ships accounted for approximately of our revenues 
we cannot assure you that any of these agreements will be renewed after their expiration date or that any renewal will be on similar terms 
also  we cannot assure you that upon renewal  these agreements will not cause reductions in our margins 
these agreements provide for termination by the cruise lines with limited or no advance notice under certain circumstances  including  among other things  failure of a cruise line to meet a specified passenger occupancy rate  the withdrawal of a vessel from the cruise trade  the sale or lease of a vessel or our failure to achieve specified passenger service standards 
as of march   agreements for two ships provided for termination for any reason by the cruise line on six months notice  agreements for four ships provided for termination for any reason by the cruise line on days notice and  with respect to one ship  we received notice that our agreement would not be renewed after its march  termination date 
we also have given notice to a cruise line that we do not wish to renew an agreement covering its ship 
these eight ships which are included in the ten ships reference above accounted for of our revenues for our cruise line agreements may  therefore  be terminated prior to their specified termination dates 
termination of significant cruise lines agreements  or a series of other cruise line agreements  either upon completion of their terms or prior thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and  financial condition 
some of our land based agreements also provide for termination with limited advance notice under certain circumstances  including a failure to meet specified performance standards 
in addition  negotiations with cruise lines or resort operators may result in agreements which may not be as beneficial to us as anticipated  or non renewals of agreements 
we depend on the cruise industry and their risks are risks to us our revenues are generated principally from cruise ship passengers 
therefore  the ability of the cruise industry to attract passengers is critical to our results of operations and financial condition 
according to the cruise lines industry association  the passenger volume of cruises marketed primarily to north american consumers increased from approximately million passengers in to approximately million in however  the cruise industry may not continue to grow or may decrease in size in the future 
a decrease in passenger volume could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the cruise industry is subject to significant risks that could affect our results of operations 
accidents and other incidents involving cruise ships  environmental violations by cruise lines  restricted access to cruise ships of environmentally sensitive regions and possible increases in fuel costs could materially adversely impact the cruise industry 
a number of cruise ships have experienced outbreaks of illnesses that have affected  at times  hundreds of passengers on a ship 
the public concern over these incidents  especially if they continue  could adversely affect the cruise industry 
in addition  industry analysts have expressed concern regarding potential over capacity of ships operated by the cruise lines 
such overcapacity could adversely affect the cruise industry 
in addition  recently  several cruise lines have been discounting their fares in order to increase their passenger counts 
passengers who are cruising solely due to these discounts may reflect their cost consciousness by not spending on discretionary items  such as our services and products 
the cruise lines operate in waters and call on ports throughout the world  including geographic regions that from time to time experience political and civil unrest and armed hostilities 
historically  such events have adversely affected demand for cruise vacations 
severe weather conditions  both at sea and at ports of embarkation  also could adversely affect the cruise industry 
the cruise industry also relies to a significant extent on airlines to transport passengers to ports of embarkation 
fears of terrorist attacks  such as those of september   the war in iraq and other potential and actual armed hostilities  may cause prospective travelers to cancel their plans  including plans for cruise vacations 
in addition  any strikes or other disruptions of airline service  including of the type that followed the terrorist attacks of september  and those that could follow other terrorist attacks or armed conflicts  could adversely affect the ability of cruise passengers to reach their ports of embarkation 
cruise lines compete for consumer disposable leisure time dollars with other vacation alternatives such as land based resort hotels and sightseeing vacations 
in addition  public demand for vacation activities is influenced by general economic conditions 
a majority of cruise passengers we serve reside in north america 
the economic downturn currently being experienced in north america  as well as future periods of general economic recession  could have a material adverse effect on the cruise industry and could also have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the aftermath of the september  and other hostilities may adversely impact our financial results and growth both steiner leisure and the leisure industry in general have been adversely affected in the aftermath of the september  terrorist attacks on new york and washington and may be adversely affected by the war in iraq 
in addition  our resort spa results of operations in indonesia and malaysia were adversely affected by the terrorist bombings in bali  indonesia  in october and are continuing to be so adversely affected 
domestic and international leisure travel and resort occupancy  which already had been adversely affected by the economic downturn in the united states and internationally  have decreased further and are likely to remain depressed over the near term as potential travelers reduce or avoid discretionary air and other travel in light of the increased safety concerns and anticipated travel delays 
those attacks  the threat of additional attacks and the war in iraq also have decreased consumer confidence  and a resulting further decline in the us and global ec onomies could further reduce travel 
at present  it is not possible to predict either the severity or duration of such declines  but weaker cruise industry and resort hotel performance could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on certain cruise companies  and the loss of one or two significant cruise line customers could harm us as a result of the consolidation of the cruise industry  the number of independent cruise companies has decreased in the past few years 
in the second half of  premier and commodore cruise lines ceased to operate 
in september  renaissance cruise line ceased its operations 
further consolidation of the cruise industry may occur 
as a result of industry consolidation  a small number of cruise companies  all of whom currently are our customers  dominate the cruise industry 
revenues from passengers of each of the following cruise companies accounted for more than ten percent of our revenues in carnival including carnival  costa  holland america  windstar and cunard seabourn lines  and royal caribbean including royal caribbean and celebrity cruise lines 
in addition  passengers of p o princess including princess and p o european ferries accounted for of our revenue in in january  carnival entered into an agreement to acquir e p o princess 
these companies also accounted for of the ships served by us as of march  if we cease to serve one of these cruise companies  or a substantial number of ships operated by a cruise company  it could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are required to make minimum payments under our agreements and face increasing payments to cruise lines and resort operators steiner leisure is obligated to make minimum payments to certain cruise lines and resort operators regardless of the amount of revenues we receive from customers 
we may also be required to make such minimum annual payments under any future cruise line or land based spa agreements we enter into with resort owners or others 
accordingly  we could be obligated to pay more than the amount collected from customers or might not receive revenues sufficient to cover our costs 
as of december   these payments are required by cruise line agreements covering a total of ships served by us and two additional ships not yet in service 
as of december   steiner leisure guaranteed total minimum payments to cruise lines excluding payments based on minimum passenger per diems applicable to certain ships served by us of approximately million in  million in  and million in these amounts could increase under new  or renewed  agreements 
some of the minimum annual payments are calculated based upon minimum passenger per diems for passengers actually embarked on each cruise of the respective vessel 
these payments could significantly increase the minimum payments above 
in general  steiner leisure has experienced increases in required payments to cruise lines upon renewing  or entering into new agreements with cruise lines 
as of december  steiner leisure guaranteed total minimum payments to resorts of approximately million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
these amounts could increase under new  or renewed agreements 
we depend on the continued viability of the ships and resorts we serve our revenues from shipboard customers and customers at land based resorts we serve can only be generated if the ships and resorts we serve continue to operate 
premier  commodore and renaissance cruise lines ceased operating in and the aladdin resort and casino  where we began operating a luxury spa in december  has filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws 
the aladdin resort continues to operate and we have taken legal steps to protect our interest as the operator of the spa at that resort 
we cannot assure you  however  as to the continued viability of the aladdin resort and casino including our ability to protect our substantial investment in our build out there or of any of the other cruise lines or resorts that we serve 
to the extent that cruise lines or resorts that we serve  or could potentially serve in the future  cease to operate  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially  adversely affected 
delays in new ship introductions could harm us our growth depends  in part  on our serving new cruise ships brought into service 
a number of cruise lines we serve have experienced in the past  and continue to experience  delays in bringing new ships into service 
in addition  there are a limited number of shipyards in the world capable of constructing large cruise ships in accordance with the standards of major cruise lines 
this may also contribute to delays in new ship construction 
such delays could have a material  adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on our key officers and qualified employees our continued success depends to a significant extent on our senior executive officers  including clive e 
warshaw  chairman of the board  leonard i 
fluxman  president and chief executive officer  and glenn j 
fusfield  chief operating officer 
in addition  as a result of our limited experience with land based spa operations  the success of our land based spas depends to a significant extent on the senior officers who run those operations 
the loss of services of any of these persons or other key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
steiner leisure has employment agreements with mr 
warshaw  mr 
fluxman and mr 
fusfield and with the senior officers of our land based spa operations  but does not have in place key person life insurance policies with respect to any of our officers 
our continued success is also dependent on our ability to recruit and retain personnel qualified to perform our shipboard and land based services 
one important tool for attracting and retaining key steiner leisure management personnel and other employees of the company is the issuance of stock options or other equity incentives to such employees 
only a limited number of shares are currently available for grants to employees under our stock option and incentive plan 
recently  it has become more difficult than in the past for companies to obtain the needed shareholder approval to make additional shares available for option grants or other equity grants to employees 
to the extent we are unable to amend our option plan to make available more shares for grants to management and other key employees  our ability to attract and retain key employees could be materially  adversely affected 
our continued success is also dependent on our ability to recruit and retain personnel qualified to perform our shipboard and land based services 
shipboard employees typically are employed pursuant to agreements with terms of eight months 
land based spa employees are generally employed on an at will basis 
other providers of shipboard spa services have been competing with us for shipboard personnel 
we also compete with spas and other employers for land based personnel 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to attract a sufficient number of applicants possessing the requisite skills necessary for our business 
if we are unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified applicants to provide our services and products  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially  adversely affected 
we depend on a single product manufacturer almost all of the ingredients and other materials for our elemis and la therapie beauty products are produced by a single manufacturer  pursuant to an agreement that terminates in december if this manufacturer ceased producing  for any reason  these ingredients and other materials for our products  the transition to other manufacturers could result in significant production delays 
any significant delay or disruption in the supply of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales 
possible adverse changes in the taxation of steiner leisure background steiner leisure is a bahamas international business company ibc that  directly or indirectly  owns steiner transocean limited  our principal subsidiary and a bahamas ibc that conducts our shipboard operations  steiner management services llc  a florida limited liability company that performs administrative services in connection with our operations in exchange for fees from steiner transocean and other subsidiaries management services  greenhouse day spa group  inc  a florida corporation that operates our greenhouse day spas which are in the process of being closed or otherwise disposed of  steiner spa asia limited  a bahamas company that owns mandara spa asia limited  a british virgin islands company that owns mandara spa asia limited 
steiner day spas  inc  a california corporation that operates our c 
spa day spas which are in the process of being closed or otherwise disposed of  steiner beauty products  inc  a florida corporation that retails and distributes beauty and hair care products  steiner spa resorts nevada  inc  a florida corporation that operates our spa at the aladdin resort in las vegas  nevada  steiner spa resorts connecticut  inc  a florida corporation involved in the build out and operation of our spa at the mohegan resort in uncasville  connecticut  elemis limited  a united kingdom company that operates our elemis day spa in london and distributes our elemis and la therapie products in the united kingdom  cosmetics limited  a bahamas company that owns the rights to  and distributes our elemis and la therapie products  other than in the united kingdom  steiner education group  a florida corporation which we operate through its subsidiary our massage therapy schools  steiner leisure also owns all  or almost all  of the shares of additional united states  bahamas  united kingdom and other subsidiaries through which we conduct our business 
steiner leisure and its bahamas ibc subsidiaries are not subject to bahamas or other tax  except as set forth below 
steiner leisure s united states subsidiaries are subject to us income tax as a consolidated group at regular corporate rates up to 
steiner leisure believes that none of its other income will be effectively connected with our deemed conduct of business in the united states and  accordingly  that our remaining income will not be subject to united states federal income tax 
steiner transocean is a bahamas ibc and is not subject to bahamas tax 
as discussed above  a foreign corporation generally is subject to united states federal corporate income tax at a rate of up to on its united states source income and on certain of its foreign source income that is effectively connected to a business it conducts in the united states 
we believe that steiner transocean s income will be foreign source income  none of which will be effectively connected to a business it conducts in the united states 
this belief is based on the following factors all of steiner transocean s shipboard spa and salon services being performed outside the united states and its possessions and their respective territorial waters  passage of title and transfer of ownership of all beauty products sold by steiner transocean taking place outside the united states  and the activities performed on behalf of steiner transocean in the united states not being a material factor in generating income for steiner transocean 
the risks to us however  a portion of steiner transocean s income could be subject to united states federal income tax to the extent the first two activities described above were considered by the united states internal revenue service to occur in the united states  its possessions or territorial waters  if regulation or legislation is enacted that changes the way the irs views the taxability of our operations  or if the activities performed on behalf of steiner transocean in the united states were considered to be a material factor in generating steiner transocean s income 
in that event  steiner transocean would be subject to us federal income tax at a rate of up to 
if steiner transocean is subject to united states federal income tax at a rate of up to on its united states source income and on certain of its foreign source income that is effectively connected to a business it conducts in the united states  it would also be subject to a branch tax of imposed on its after tax earnings subject to united states federal income tax that are withdrawn or considered to be withdrawn from its united states business 
for similar reasons  certain non us jurisdictions may also assert that steiner transaction s income is subject to their income tax 
management services receives payments from steiner transocean and other bahamas subsidiaries of steiner leisure in return for certain administrative services it provides to steiner transocean 
the irs may assert that transactions between management services and steiner transocean and between our other direct and indirect subsidiaries do not contain arms length terms 
in that event  income or deductions could be reallocated among the subsidiaries in a manner that could increase the taxable income of management services 
this reallocation also could result in the imposition of interest and penalties 
management services and steiner beauty also may be subject to additional us state and local income  franchise and other taxes 
our united kingdom subsidiaries provide goods and services to steiner transocean and cosmetics limited 
the united kingdom inland revenue authorities may assert that these transactions do not contain arms length terms 
in that event  income or deductions could be reallocated among the subsidiaries in a manner that could increase the uk tax on us 
this reallocation also could result in the imposition of interest and penalties 
we cannot assure you that the tax laws that we have relied on to minimize our income taxes will remain unchanged in the future 
in january  the irs proposed regulations that  if adopted  could possibly subject a portion of our shipboard income to us federal income tax 
in  steiner leisure paid tax at an aggregate rate of on its income 
the increase in our land based operations since has significantly increased  and is expected in the future to significantly increase  the amount of our non shipboard income 
this could result in a significant increase in the amount of our income that is subject to taxation 
in addition  such amount of income subject to tax will increase to the extent our land based income is increased relative to our shipboard income 
we face competition on ships and on land we compete with passenger activity alternatives on cruise ships and with competing providers of services and products similar to ours seeking agreements with cruise lines 
gambling casinos  bars and a variety of shops are found on almost all of the ships served by us 
in addition  ships dock in ports which provide opportunities for additional shopping as well as other activities that compete with us for passenger attention and dollars 
cruise ships also typically offer swimming pools and other recreational facilities and activities  as well as musical and other entertainment  all without additional charge to the passengers 
one cruise line has indicated that it intends to provide the shipboard services and products we currently provide with its own personnel and one or more additional cruise lines could elect to provide these services and products themselves in the future 
in addition  there are several other entities offering services in the cruise industry similar t o those provided by us  including harding brothers and other providers 
many of the resorts we serve  as well as any resorts that we may serve in the future  offer recreational entertainment facilities and activities  often without additional charge to guests  similar to those offered on cruise ships 
a number of these resorts also offer casino gambling 
our day spas compete with other day spa chains and individual day spas which have operations in the vicinities of our day spas  as well as with other beauty  relaxation or other therapeutic alternatives that compete for consumer dollars 
these include  with respect to hair and manicure and pedicure services  large  well known national chains and independently owned salons that offer these services at prices significantly lower than those charged by us 
we believe  however  that the prices charged by us are appropriate for the quality of the experience we provide to our customers 
in addition  steiner leisure is relatively new to the land based spa industry and our spas compete with spas and beauty salons owned or operated by companies that have offered land based spa services longer than we have and which may enjoy greater name recognition with customers and prospective customers  than the land based spas operated by us 
the post secondary education market is highly competitive 
our massage therapy schools compete with providers of similar instruction in the states in which they are located and elsewhere in the united states  including many providers with greater resources than ours 
our schools face competition from  among others  traditional public and private two year and four year colleges and universities and other proprietary schools  including those that offer distance learning programs 
some public institutions are able to charge lower tuition than our schools  due in part to government subsidies  government and foundation grants  tax deductible contributions and other financial sources not available to proprietary schools such as ours 
the recent slow down in the technology sector is causing a number of our competitors who have traditionally offered instruction relating to that sector to modify their course offerings 
a number of those schools are now offering or contemplating offering progra ms similar to ours 
this will increase the competition for students 
our land based product sales compete with a variety of other brands  including those of manufacturers with greater resources than ours  and those with greater name recognition than our products  including large entities with greater resources than ours 
our land based operations face additional risks we have limited experience in land based operations in july  we made a series of acquisitions which resulted in our being the operators of the greenhouse  mandara and c 
spa land based spa chains 
in and  we acquired three massage therapy schools with nine campuses located in florida and several mid atlantic states 
as a result of these acquisitions and other recent land based activities  and despite the disposition of most of our land based operations  an increased portion of our business is now represented by land based operations 
in the future  we may decide to grow our business through other land based acquisitions that we deem appropriate 
prior to the acquisitions described above  our business almost entirely consisted of providing spa services and products on cruise ships and we had only limited experience with respect to land based operations 
our day spa operations did not prove to be beneficial to our overall results of operations  and there is a risk that we will not be able otherwise to duplicate any suc cess we have had with our shipboard operations in our land based operations 
in order to successfully conduct our land based businesses  we will be required to effectively and efficiently integrate the businesses we have acquired 
if we are unable to successfully integrate our land based spa operations  or any other land based operations we may acquire in the future our business and financial results could be materially  adversely affected 
the success of our land based business also depends on our ability to hire and retain the services of qualified personnel 
we cannot assure you that a sufficient number of highly qualified personnel will be available to us 
risks relating to our day spa operations we have  as of march   we disposed of  or otherwise closed  of the day spas we are disposing of 
we intend to dispose of the remaining four of those day spas in the near future 
our loss on disposal of these discontinued operations is estimated to be approximately million for our loss on operations in connection with these discontinued operations was approximately million for additional losses on disposal and operations will be incurred in  but the amounts thereof are not currently known 
in addition  most of the agreements under which we have closed or otherwise disposed of the day spas required us to pay rent for various periods of time after the date we ceased to operate the spas involved 
in addition  in connection with most of the agreements relating to the disposition of day spas to third parties  we remain liable under the leases for those day spas in the event the third party lease assignees fail to pay rent u nder such leases 
the total amount that we remain liable for under such assigned leases  if the assignees fail to make the payments that they are required to make is approximately million 
risks of non us operations a total of of our non united states resort spa operations are located in indonesia  thailand and malaysia 
the indonesian island of bali  where we have resort spas  was the site of a terrorist attack in october in addition  all three of these countries have experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  political and or economic unrest 
in addition  countries where we currently or may in the future operate spas may experience adverse developments in the political and economic environment  varying governmental regulations  foreign currency fluctuations and potential adverse tax consequences 
such adverse developments  among other things  could prevent us from adequately supervising these operations and could materially adversely affect the financial performance of these operations 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also operate spas in the caribbean  the pacific and other locations that are subject to severe weather conditions  including hurricanes and other destructive storms 
in the fourth quarter of  guam  where we operate several resort spas  was hit by a significant typhoon 
that typhoon resulted in damage to our properties and the closing of the resorts in which they were located  causing us to suffer a loss of revenues 
similar storms or other destructive natural occurrences affecting the areas in which we have operations could materially  adversely affect our results of operations 
our resort spas depend on the resort hotel industry we operate luxury spas at resorts located in countries 
similar to our dependence on the cruise industry with respect to our shipboard services and products  we are dependent on the resort hotel industry for the success of our resort spas 
to the extent that consumers do not choose to stay at resorts where we operate spas  as to which we have no control  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially  adversely affected 
the hotel resort industry is subject to risks that are  in many ways  similar to that of the cruise industry and include the following risks changes in the national  regional and local economic climate including major national or international events such as the terrorist attacks of september   the october bali terrorist attack and the war in iraq  local conditions  including an oversupply of hotel properties  or a reduction in demand for hotel rooms  the attractiveness of the hotels to consumers and competition from comparable hotels  the outbreak of illnesses in locations where we operate resort spas  the performance of the employees at the resorts we serve  possible labor unrest or changes in economics based on collective bargaining activities  changes in room rates at the resorts we serve  and the maintenance of the resorts we serve and changes in popular travel patterns 
to the extent that there are adverse changes in the foregoing conditions  this could adversely affect the financial performance of our resort spa operations 
risks relating to our schools in august  we acquired a post secondary school comprised of four campuses in florida offering degree and non degree programs in massage therapy  skin care and related areas 
in april  we acquired a total of two massage therapy schools currently comprised of four campuses in maryland  virginia and pennsylvania 
we had no prior experience in operations of this type and we cannot assure you that these businesses will perform as we anticipate 
if we are unable to successfully operate these schools  or any other non spa related operations that we may acquire in the future  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially  adversely affected 
in the fourth quarter of  we appointed a new senior executive in our schools division 
while we believe that this new senior executive has the qualifications to successfully lead that division  she has had limited experience in her new capacity and we cannot assure you that she  in fact  will be able to successfully manage our school operations 
we may have insufficient liquidity to take advantage of available opportunities among other parts of our business plan  we will consider land based opportunities to operate spas at resorts 
we have been required in connection with obtaining a number of resort spa leases to incur the cost of the build out of the spa facilities 
we have drawn down all available funds under the revolving credit portion of our credit facility and we are subject to restrictions on capital expenditures under our credit facility 
other limitations on capital expenditures  or on other operational matters  could apply in the future 
also  the recent amendment to our credit facility provided us with partial relief with respect to principal payments for the first quarter of the result of that relief is that we will be required to use a portion of our cash flow to make interest payments with respect to that unpaid principal 
accordingly  and due to the fact that our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to enable us to build out the facilities at resorts where we otherwi se would like to operate spas  we may not be able to take advantage of otherwise favorable opportunities to operate resort spas 
in addition  in general  in the event we exceed our currently anticipated cash capital expenditures or our cash flow from operations is less than anticipated  we would need to seek additional equity or debt financing to fund our business plan 
among other things that could cause our cash flow to be less than anticipated is the reduction in leisure travel that could result from the war in iraq and or the continued threats of terrorist attacks 
additional financing  including a new credit facility  may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
risks relating to build out of land based spas in connection with our agreements relating to our spas at the atlantis resort and casino  the ocean club  the aladdin resort and casino  the hilton hawaiian village resort and the mohegan sun resort we have been required to build out the spa facilities we are to operate at our own expense 
in connection with any other new land based resort spas that we may seek to operate in the future  we may wish  or be required  to build out the spa s facilities at our own expense 
to date  the cost to build out these large facilities has ranged from million to million 
any land based spas we might wish to operate in the future could require build out expenditures within that range or above it  and we cannot assure you that we would have available sufficient resources to take advantage of any such opportunity 
such build outs involve risks to us  including as follows the commencement of the build outs generally cannot begin until the venue owner has completed its own construction site around the premises of the proposed spa 
we have no control over that process and that process  as well as weather related postponements and other factors affecting construction projects generally  could delay our spa s opening date  a date upon which our financial model for the spa may be tied 
if the resort owner files for bankruptcy or otherwise has financial problems prior to opening of the spa  the spa may never commence operations and funds  possibly substantial funds  that we may have expended on the build out to that point may be lost if we lose our rights to build out and or operate that spa as a result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding 
the operator of the aladdin resort and casino  where we lease facilities and operate a luxury spa  has filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code and continues to conduct its operations 
we built out this luxury spa facility at a cost of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that the company s proposed operations at the aladdin resort and casino will not be adversely affected by aladdin s bankruptcy filing 
government regulation could adversely affect us products steiner leisure s advertising and product labeling practices in the united states are subject to regulation by the federal trade commission and the food and drug administration  as well as various other federal  state and local regulatory authorities 
the contents of our products that are sold in the united states are subject to regulation in the united states 
we are subject to similar regulation under the laws of the united kingdom and certain european union laws 
federal  state and local regulations in the united states and non united states jurisdictions  including increasing regulation by the european union  designed to protect consumers or the environment could increase the cost of  or otherwise materially adversely affect the advertising  manufacturing and packaging our products 
land based spas steiner leisure s land based spa operations are subject to applicable regulations in the locations where such operations are conducted 
these regulations could adversely effect our ability to sell  or could increase the cost of  our services and products
