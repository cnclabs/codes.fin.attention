item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information which involves risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in this report which are not historical facts including  but not limited to  the company s expectations regarding revenues  business strategy  anticipated operating results  strategies with respect to governmental agencies and regulations  cash dividends and anticipated cash requirements may be forward looking statements 
the company s actual results may differ from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  employee hiring practices of the company s principal customers  risks associated with the continued expansion of the company s sales and marketing network  development of markets for new products and services offered by the company  the economic health of principal customers of the company  financial and operational risks associated with possible expansion of testing facilities used by the company  government regulation including  but not limited to  food and drug administration regulations  competition and general economic conditions 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in item of this form k 
management believes the most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition revenues from the company s services are recognized upon reporting of drug test results to the customer 
deferred revenue represents payments in advance of performance of drug testing procedures 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of its customer accounts 
the company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and  as a consequence  believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited 
the company maintains an allowance for potential credit losses but historically has not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves the preparation of an estimate of the company s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  it must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  it may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result
