critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies revenue recognition and estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from two sources product revenue  which includes software license and services and support revenue  which includes software license maintenance  software development  training  consulting and hosting revenue 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of software 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we assess evidence of an arrangement based on contracts signed by both parties and delivery based on fob shipping point unless otherwise specified in the contract 
satisfaction of delivery is also assessed based on the absence of acceptance provisions in the contract or achievement of written acceptance in the event it is contractually required 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transaction is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction generally must be within days and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements containing multiple elements  revenue is recognized on delivered elements when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value has been established on the undelivered elements  applying the residual method of sop fair value is determined for each undelivered element based on the price charged for the sale of each element separately 
in contracts that contain first year maintenance bundled with software fees  unbundling of maintenance is based on the price charged for renewal maintenance 
for certain contracts where services are deemed essential to the functionality of the software and the software has not been accepted by the customer  the software and related service revenue have not been recognized 
in addition  all costs incurred in connection with these contracts have been expensed  as the company has been unable to estimate the total cost to achieve customer acceptance 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
revenues related to hosting arrangements  including ebixasp  are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  including monthly fees as well as any initial registration fees and related custom programing 
ebix 
mall referral  acceptance and transaction fees are recognized as revenue as the transactions occur and revenue is earned 
revenue is only recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  results of operations ebix
