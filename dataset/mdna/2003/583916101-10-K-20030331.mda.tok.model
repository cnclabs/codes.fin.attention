item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report and contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of human antibody based therapeutic products using our proprietary technology platform  the ultimab human antibody development system sm 
this unique combination of human antibody technologies enables us to rapidly create and develop high affinity  fully human antibodies to a wide range of diseases  including cancer  inflammation  auto immune disease and other life threatening and debilitating diseases 
through our acquisition of genpharm international  inc and our collaboration with kirin brewery co 
ltd  we expanded our business to include both our humab mouse and kirin s tc mouse technologies 
in december we unveiled the km mouse  a unique crossbred mouse developed in partnership with kirin  as the newest addition to our ultimab human antibody development system 
with the ultimab sm platform  we have assembled a unique family of human antibody technologies for creating the entire spectrum of high affinity  fully human antibodies 
we intend to leverage our product development capabilities with those of our partners  while also gaining access to novel therapeutic targets and complementary development  sales and marketing infrastructures 
as of march   we have over partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including industry leaders such as amgen  inc  centocor  inc 
a subsidiary of johnson johnson  eli lilly company  human genome sciences  inc  abbott laboratories  inc  novartis pharma ag  novo nordisk a s  and schering ag  to jointly develop and commercialize products or enable other companies to use our proprietary technology in their development and commercialization of new therapeutic products 
some of our partnerships are licensing partnerships  with the potential to pay us licensing fees  milestone payments and royalty payments  others are collaborative partnerships and provide for the sharing of product development costs  as well as any revenues  expenses and profits associated with products arising under the collaboration 
our licensing partners typically obtain licenses to one or more of our antibody generating technologies which we expect will allow these partners to develop and commercialize antibody based products using our technology 
we could receive license fees  milestones and royalties in connection with each of these products 
under these licenses  there is usually an initial period during which our partners may elect to enter into a research license for antibodies to a particular designated target 
subsequently  our partners may elect to obtain a commercial license for monoclonal antibodies to a particular target 
we are also pursuing an applied genomics strategy in order to gain access to new target antigens as they are identified  while also sharing the risks and rewards of the related antibody development and commercialization 
to this end  we have established a number of collaborative partnerships with leading 
table of contents companies in the fields of genomics and proteomics to jointly develop and commercialize human antibody products 
typically  our partner will provide a target antigen  and we will generate antibodies against that antigen using our ultimab human antibody development system 
we and our partners typically agree to share equally costs of clinical development and manufacturing as well as revenues  expenses and profits associated with the products arising under the collaboration 
revenue our revenue is principally derived through licensing our human antibody technology to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the terms of these agreements typically include potential license fees and a series of potential milestone payments commencing upon initiation of clinical trials and continuing through commercialization 
these payments may total million to million per product if the antibody receives approval from the fda and equivalent foreign agencies 
we are also entitled to royalties on product sales 
additional revenue is earned from the sales to and  in some cases  manufacturing of antibodies for corporate partners and from government grants 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation expense  facilities  preclinical and clinical trials and supply expense relating to antibody product development and to the breeding  caring for and continued development of each of the humab mouse and km mouse  as well as to the performance of contract services for our collaborative partners 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  facility  travel  legal fees and other expenses relating to our general management  financial  administrative and business development activities 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition historically  a significant portion of our revenue has been recognized pursuant to collaboration and license agreements with our partners 
revenue related to collaborative research with our partners is recognized as earned based upon the performance requirements of each agreement 
deferred revenue may result when we do not expend the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective agreements or when funds received are refundable under certain circumstances 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements and when collectibility of such milestone payment is assured 
non refundable upfront payments received in connection with our collaborative partnerships are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we are obligated to perform services related to each of the respective agreements 
investments all marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are carried at fair value 
marketable securities will include those securities of debt and publicly traded equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
these securities trade on listed exchanges  therefore  fair value is readily available 
these 
table of contents securities are also subject to an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
under our accounting policy  a decline in the value of our investments is deemed to be other than temporary and such investments are generally considered to be impaired if their value is less than our cost basis for more than six months  or some other period in light of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investments 
in addition  in connection with our collaborative partnering business  we make strategic investments in the securities of companies that are privately held 
these securities are carried at original investment cost 
because these securities are not listed on a financial exchange  we value these investments by using information acquired from industry trends  the management of these companies  financial statements  and other external sources 
based on the information acquired through these sources  we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or adverse changes in operating results of underlying investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value may also require an impairment charge in the future 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  and or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets or long lived assets are not recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that have not been previously recorded 
acquired in process technology in process technology expense is determined based on an analysis using risk adjusted cash flows expected to be generated by products that may result from in process technologies which have been acquired 
this analysis includes forecasting future cash flows that are expected to result from the progress made on each in process project prior to the acquisition date 
cash flows are estimated by first forecasting  on a product by product basis  net revenues expected from the sales of the first generation of each in process project and risk adjusting these revenues to reflect the probability of advancing to the next stage of the fda approval process 
the forecast data in the analysis is based on internal product level forecast information maintained by us in the ordinary course of business 
the inputs used in analyzing in process technology is based on assumptions  which we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
appropriate operating expenses are deducted from forecasted net revenues on a product by product basis to establish a forecast of net returns on the completed portion of the in process technology 
finally  net returns are discounted to a present value using discount rates that incorporate the weighted average cost of capital relative to the biotech industry and our company as well as product specific risks associated with the acquired in process research and development products 
the product specific risk factors include the product s phase of development  type of antibody under development  likelihood of regulatory approval  manufacturing process capability  scientific rationale  preclinical safety and efficacy data  target product profile  and development plan 
in addition to the product specific risk factors  a discount rate is 
table of contents used for the valuation  which represents a considerable risk premium to our weighted average cost of capital 
the valuations used to estimate in process technology require us to use significant estimates and assumptions that if changed  may result in a different valuation for in process technology 
a valuation for our acquisition of assets from corixa corporation was completed by an independent third party 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues for  and were principally derived from our contract and licensing activities 
total revenue for of million included contract and license revenues of million from kirin  million from idm and million from scil biomedicals 
total revenue for of million increased by million  or over the increase relates principally to an increase of million of contract and license revenues from idm and an increase of million of sales  contract and license revenues from genmab 
total revenue for of million decreased by million  a decrease compared to the decrease relates principally to a decrease of contract and license revenues of million from kirin and million from idm partially offset by an increase of million of sales  contract and license revenues from genmab 
as a result of genmab s announced decision to wind down its anti cd program for rheumatoid arthritis  we anticipate that sales of mdx cd and corresponding cost of sales will be significantly lower in the future 
in addition  we expect contract and license revenues to be lower in the future as a result of the completion in september of the revenue recognition associated with the transfer of technology to idm in july our cost of sales of million in was due to higher production of mdx cd that was sold to genmab 
cost of sales were million in  a decrease of million  or a decrease compared to despite comparable sales 
the decrease primarily reflects a lower unit production cost of mdx cd cost of sales were million in  an increase of million  or  over the increase primarily reflects the production cost of mdx cd that was sold to genmab in research and development expenses are largely comprised of i personnel costs  ii those expenses related to facilities for our clinical research  development and clinical trial manufacturing efforts  iii third party research costs  iv supply costs and v license and technology access fees 
our total research and development costs from inception to date are million 
we have incurred research and development expenses for our products in development of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses in were million  an increase of million  or over research and development expenses in were million an increase of million  or over the increases relate primarily to costs associated with the following personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or over personnel costs in were million  an increase of million or over the increase in staff is to support higher levels of product development and clinical trial manufacturing activities  the continued development of our ultimab system  as well as the performance of contract services for our collaborative partners and clinical activities 
included in the increase are salary  benefits  payroll taxes and recruiting costs 
we expect personnel costs to continue to increase  but at a slower rate  as we continue to increase our product development activities and progress our products in clinical trials 
facility costs in were million  an increase of million or over facility costs in were million  an increase of million or over the increase in facility costs primarily relates to the substantial investments made in our three research and development facilities during and as a result  depreciation  utilities  maintenance  property taxes and related expenses increased for each of the years ended december  and  as compared to the prior year periods 
we expect to incur increased facility costs as a result of continued capital expansion  renovations and replacements but at a reduced rate 

table of contents research supply costs in were million  an increase of million or over research supply costs in were million  and increase of million or over included in these costs are materials and small equipment associated with the development of our products 
we expect these costs to increase as we continue to expand our research and product development activities 
outside funding of research in was a credit of million  a decrease of million  or a decrease compared to outside funding of research in was million  an increase of million or over during  we made a million upfront payment to eos biotechnology  under our binding letter of intent 
the decrease was principally due to the april refund of this million fee by eos as part of a restructuring of that collaboration and this resulted in a credit balance in outside funding of research in excluding the refund  the and periods were comparable 
outside funding of research expenses include funds paid to certain partners for research services 
we expect outside funding of research expenses  including funds paid to certain partners for research services  to increase in the future 
license and technology access fees in were million  an increase of million or  over license and technology access fees in were million  an increase of million or over these costs represent fees paid to partner and research organizations in connection with our collaboration and license agreements 
included in the cost are payments to northwest biotherapeutics  tularik and millennium pharmaceuticals 
we expect license fees  including funds paid to certain partners  to increase in the future 
we also expect expenses related to clinical trials to increase in the future as we continue to develop our therapeutic product pipeline 
as part of our partnering strategy  a significant portion of the research and development expenses incurred in connection with products using our technology is expected to be borne by our partners 
we believe this allows us to participate in the research and development of substantially more potential product candidates than we could develop on our own if we bore the entire cost of development 
products using our technology are currently in various stages of development from preclinical to phase iii 
the successful development of these product candidates is dependent on many factors  including among other things  the efforts of our partners  unforeseen delays in  or expenditures relating to  preclinical development  clinical testing  manufacturing or regulatory approval  failure to receive market acceptance  the emergence of competitive products and the inability to produce or market our products due to third party proprietary rights 
general and administrative expenses in were million  an increase of million  or as compared to general and administrative expenses of million in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in personnel costs  as well as higher legal and travel costs incurred in connection with the expansion of our business activities 
the increase was partially offset by lower consulting and shareholder relation expenses 
general and administrative expenses in were million  an increase of million  or over the increase is primarily attributable to higher personnel costs of million  depreciation expense of million  insurance expense of million and legal fees of million 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the future as our products are developed and we expand our business activities 
write off of facility costs relates to a determination we made during the second quarter of to delay indefinitely the planned construction of a large scale manufacturing facility at our bloomsbury  new jersey location and to pursue late stage clinical and commercial supply agreements with third party manufacturers with available capacity to meet our current internal production timetables 
we are in negotiation with third party manufacturers for clinical and commercial supply agreements 
as of march   we had not entered into any such supply agreements 
as a result of this decision  we recorded a charge of million  representing the write off of design  engineering and other pre construction costs 
furthermore  we have expanded our existing clinical manufacturing capacity in our annandale  new jersey facility  which we expect will meet all near term production demands 
acquisition of in process technology relates to our acquisition of certain assets of corixa in may the total cost of the acquisition including transaction costs  discussed more fully under the section herein entitled 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources  was million 
based upon an independent third party valuation  million of this amount was charged to operations as acquisition of in process technology in equity in net loss of affiliate of million in reflects our share of genmab s loss for the year ended december  equity in net loss of affiliate in was million  an increase of million over the increased loss reflects our share of genmab s loss for the full year 
this loss is primarily the result of genmab s increased activity in research and development and expansion of its business 
genmab is an affiliated company and is accounted for using the equity method see note to the consolidated financial statements 
equity in net loss of affiliate in was million  an increase of million or over included in the equity in net loss of affiliate is in an impairment loss on our investment in genmab of million resulting from an approximate decrease in the market value of genmab stock following genmab s september  press release in which it announced that its humax cd product  a fully human antibody that targets cd receptor on cells known as t cells was found not to be effective in combination with methotrexate in a phase ii study of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis 
we recorded the million impairment charge in the third quarter of as a result of the decrease in the market price of the genmab stock 
if we deem this investment to be further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur an additional impairment charge on this investment 
excluding this impairment charge  equity in net loss of affiliate in was million  an increase million  or over this increase reflects an increase in genmab s net loss as a result of genmab s expanded research and development efforts 
we expect genmab s net loss to increase in due to their stated intention to make additional investments in research and development costs to develop its product pipeline 
the recognition of our equity in genmab s net losses reduces the carrying value basis of our investment in genmab 
interest and dividend income in was million  an increase of million  or as compared to interest and dividend income of million 
the increase reflects interest earned on higher average cash balances as the result of proceeds received from the june  public offering of our convertible subordinated notes due in interest and dividend income in was million  a decrease of million  or a decrease compared to the decrease reflects lower interest income due to lower average cash balances in as we funded our operations and capital expenditures from our cash reserves 
we anticipate lower investment income in the future as we continue to liquidate our investments to fund our operations and capital expenditures 
impairment loss on investments in partners of million during represents a write down of the value of our investments in certain of our partners both publicly and privately held 
during  the decline in the value of these investments was determined to be other than temporary 
if we deem these investments to be further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur additional impairment charges on these investments 
additional payments related to asset acquisition of million during represents additional payments to northwest biotherapeutics  millennium pharmaceuticals and corixa corporation 
pursuant to the terms of these agreements  under certain circumstances we were required to pay an amount equal to the difference between the proceeds received by these companies from the sale of any shares of our common stock delivered as payment of any installment of the purchase price of the assets and the total amount of the purchase price installment due under the agreements 
interest expense in was million  an increase of million over this increase reflects accrued interest for approximately six months on the convertible subordinated notes issued on june  and due in interest expense in was million  an increase of million  or over this increase reflects a full year of interest expense incurred on our convertible subordinate notes 
interest is payable on january and july of each year 
our benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  of million was partially due to our recording of an increased basis of genmab s assets from its initial public offering in october it consisted 
table of contents of million of deferred tax benefit and million from the sale of new jersey state nols  offset  in part  by provisions for federal and state taxes and by current and deferred foreign withholding tax expense 
the deferred tax benefit related to deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance was necessary because an equivalent amount of deferred tax liability was established  related to an unrealized gain included in comprehensive income 
the tax benefit is principally derived from our portion of the increase in the book value of the assets of genmab resulting from the proceeds genmab received upon completion of its initial public offering in october the current federal and state tax provisions for the year ended december  resulted from revenue that is deferred for financial reporting purposes but not for tax reporting purposes  and from limitation of the available federal nols 
after tax deductions related to exercises of stock options  no current federal or state taxes were payable at december  applicable accounting rules require recognition of tax benefits associated with these deductions through adjustment to additional paid in capital rather than through current tax expense 
our tax expense for the year ended december  of million was the result of deferred foreign tax assets reversing in the million of tax expense for the year ended december  relates to the new jersey alternative minimum tax assessment which became effective in we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operations  to make capital expenditures and strategic investments  and to pay debt service on our convertible note issue 
since inception  we have financed our operations through the sale of our securities in public and private placements  sales of our products for research purposes  development and manufacturing services  technology transfer and license fees  and milestone payments 
we expect to continue to fund our cash requirements from these sources in the future 
in  and  we received net proceeds of million from sales of our equity and debt securities 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid  interest bearing  investment grade and government securities in order to preserve principal 
cash used in operating activities 
operating activities consumed million  million  and million of cash for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in operating activities in relates primarily to the significant increase in research and development and manufacturing ie cost of goods sold expense 
in  total research and development expense of million increased by million as compared to the increase in research and development expense results from higher personnel costs  those expenses related to facilities for our clinical research  development and manufacturing efforts  third party research costs  research supply costs and license and technology access fees 
to a lesser extent  the increase in cash used in operations also results from higher general and administrative costs  attributable mainly to higher personnel costs 
partially offsetting the use of cash for these operating expenses were depreciation and amortization  non cash compensation and license fees paid in stock 
lastly  the increase in cash used in operations also resulted from reduced investment income and an increase in interest paid to our convertible note holders 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in the area of research and development  including preclinical and clinical trials  as our products are developed 
we plan to spend significant amounts to develop  on a proprietary or co developed basis  multiple product candidates 
we also expect facility costs to increase in as a result of our capital expansion and renovations 
we also expect our general and administrative costs to increase as we expand our administrative and business development activities 
our operating expenditures will only be partially offset by revenues from our partners for license fees  milestone payments  and  to a lesser extent  development and manufacturing services as well as interest and dividend income received on our investments 
going forward  we anticipate lower investment income due to lower average cash balances  resulting primarily from the funding of future operations  as well as planned capital expenditures out of our cash reserves 

table of contents cash provided by investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily the result of the following factors capital expenditures of million and million for the years and  respectively 
the decrease in capital spending in was primarily related to the completion of the renovation of our existing bloomsbury  new jersey facility  which was first opened in may  net purchases of securities for the year ended december  of million was primarily a result of the proceeds received from our convertible note offering in june see discussion below  net sales of securities for the year ended december  of million was primarily to fund operations and capital expenditures 
in november  we purchased our milpitas  california facility for approximately million 
we previously leased this facility 
this property currently contains approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space 
as of december   we had cumulatively expended approximately million on renovating and expanding this facility 
in january  we purchased a facility and adjacent land in bloomsbury  new jersey for approximately million 
the bloomsbury facility is situated on approximately acres of land and currently contains space for approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space 
we currently are using approximately  square feet as laboratory and office space 
as of december   we had cumulatively expended approximately million on renovating this facility 
in july  we entered into a lease for approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space in sunnyvale  california 
this space replaced the corixa facility in south san francisco that was occupied by employees retained in connection with our acquisition of certain assets of corixa  discussed more fully below 
during  we expended approximately million on leasehold improvements for this space 
we anticipate capital expenditures will be approximately million primarily for scientific equipment  lab automation  and final payments for the milpitas and sunnyvale improvements 
cash provided by financing activities 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was million primarily from proceeds received from common stock issuances related to our equity compensation plans 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was million primarily from the proceeds received from our june issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of payable on january and july of each year 
the cost of issuance of the notes of approximately million has been deferred and is being amortized over the five year term of the notes 
such amortization is included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and the notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness 
we may redeem any or all of the notes at any time at specified redemption prices plus possible make whole payments as defined in the indenture  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
the notes will mature on july  unless earlier converted  redeemed at our option or redeemed at the option of the noteholder upon a fundamental change as described in the indenture for the notes 
in addition  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are restricted under the indenture from paying dividends  incurring debt  or issuing or repurchasing our securities 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was million  primarily as the result of the proceeds received from the sale of our common stock in a march follow on public offering 
in may  we adopted an employee stock purchase plan  or espp  authorizing the issuance of  shares of our common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to eligible employees 
the espp provides a means by which employees purchase our common stock through payroll deductions of up to of their base compensation 
at the end of each six month purchase period during the calendar year  we use accumulated 
table of contents payroll deductions to purchase  on behalf of participating employees  shares of common stock at a price equal to the lower of of the fair market value of a share of common stock i at july  or ii at the end of each six month purchase period 
the purchase periods end on june and december of each year 
generally  all employees  including executive officers  who work at least hours per week and five months per year may participate in the espp 
employees who are deemed to own greater than of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock are not eligible for participation in the espp 
as of december    shares have been issued under the espp resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million 
net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million 
these nol carryforwards will expire in the years as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  if not utilized 
during we determined that an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  occurred during the effect of this ownership change was the imposition of a million annual limitation on the use of nol carryforwards attributable to periods before the change 
this annual limitation will result in the expiration of some nol carryforward credits before utilization 
at december  the amount of nol subject to the limitation was million and the amount not subject to limitation was million 
other liquidity matters 
in connection with our merger with essex medical products  or essex  in  we committed to pay to essex of our net after tax income until a total of million has been paid  contingent upon the occurrence of certain events 
as the result of our net income in we accrued million payable to essex  which remains accrued at december  at our option  this obligation may be satisfied by the payment of shares of our common stock having a fair market value equal to the amount owed  provided such shares are registered for sale with the sec 
in july  we entered into an agreement with idm whereby we licensed to idm certain of our technologies in exchange for equity units in idm 
as a result of this transaction  we realized a gain from the transfer of technology of approximately million based upon an independent valuation 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  during the years ended december   and  we recognized non cash revenue of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   there is no additional revenue to recognize regarding this transaction 
on may   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with corixa corporation  coulter pharmaceutical  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of corixa corporation and corixa belgium sa  a subsidiary of corixa corporation collectively referred to as corixa 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we acquired certain selected assets and business operations of corixa  including certain preclinical product candidates and programs related to the research and development of therapeutic products for the treatment of autoimmune diseases  cancer and infectious diseases 
in addition  we retained approximately corixa employees related to such product candidates and programs and agreed to temporarily  sublease approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space at corixa s south san francisco facility for six months 
this sublease terminated in november under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we acquired the corixa assets for million excluding transaction costs of million payable in six equal monthly installments of million either in cash  or at our election  in shares of common stock 
as of december   a total of  shares of common stock with a fair value of million were issued to corixa along with cash of million as payment for the million purchase price 
in the event that  during any month during the six month period following the closing of the transaction  corixa sold all of the shares of the common stock delivered as payment for the preceding monthly installment and the proceeds of such sale were less that million  we were obligated to pay the difference to corixa in cash 
during  we expensed approximately million representing the net cash shortfall experienced by corixa 
such amounts are included in additional payments related to asset acquisition in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  
table of contents we also purchased from corixa certain equipment and laboratory supplies for million of which approximately million has been capitalized with the remaining million charged to expense 
as part of this transaction  corixa may receive up to an additional million in future consideration in cash or  at our election  in shares of common stock  based upon certain contingencies 
our material contractual obligations under lease  debt and research funding agreements for the next five years  and thereafter  as of december  are as follows payments due by period less than year years years after years total in thousands contractual obligations convertible notes research funding operating leases and other total contractual cash obligations this table does not include a any milestone payments which may become payable under research collaborations or license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known  b any royalty payments to third parties as the amounts of such payments and or likelihood of such payments are not known  c amounts  if any  that may be committed in the future to construct additional facilities and d contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business which are not material in the aggregate in any period presented above 
our convertible notes may be converted to common stock prior to the maturity date and  therefore  may not require the use of our capital resources 
future liquidity resources 
our current sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  interest and dividends earned on such cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  contract and licensing revenue and sales of our products for research 
we believe that such sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our operating  debt service and capital requirements for at least the next months  however  this month period assumes the use of a portion of the million required to meet our repayment obligations with respect to our convertible notes due on july  in the event our convertible notes are converted into shares of our common stock on or before july   we will have use of the million to fund our on going operations 
in any event  we may require additional financing within this time frame and may raise funds through public or private financings  lines of credit arrangements  collaborative relationships and or other methods 
the use of cash on hand or other financial alternatives will depend on several factors including  but not limited to  the future success of our products in clinical development  the prevailing interest rate environment  and access to the capital markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise such additional funds

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we regularly invest excess operating cash in deposits with major financial institutions  money market funds  notes issued by the us government  as well as fixed income investments and us bond funds both of which can be readily purchased or sold using established markets
