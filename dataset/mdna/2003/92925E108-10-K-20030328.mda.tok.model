item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for details on weather conditions in compliance with environmental and other government regulations could adversely affect our business 
our business is significantly affected by foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry  the refining and petrochemical industry  and worker safety and environmental protection 
we depend on the demand for our products and services from oil and natural gas companies  oilfield service companies and refining and petrochemical companies 
this demand is affected by a variety of factors  including taxes  price controls and the adoption or amendment of laws and regulations 
for example  the adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas in our areas of operation for economic  environmental or other policy reasons could adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products and services 
in addition  our maintenance and safety related products and services are substantially dependent on the cleaning and maintenance operations of our customers 
numerous foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations affect the necessity  timing and frequency of the cleaning and maintenance operations of refining and petrochemical companies and thus affect the demand for our products and services 
we cannot determine the extent to which our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations or enforcement 
the technical requirements of the foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting our business are becoming increasingly complex and stringent 
for instance  some environmental laws may provide for strict liability for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety  rendering a party liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the party 
sanctions for noncompliance with these laws and regulations may include revocation of permits  corrective action orders  administrative or civil penalties  and criminal prosecution 
some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 
in addition  we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances  as well as damage to natural resources 
these laws and regulations also may expose us to liability for the conduct of  or conditions caused by  others  or for our acts that were in compliance with applicable laws at the time the acts were performed 
our business could be adversely affected by new technologies and by disputes regarding intellectual property 
many of our operations  especially those dependent on lwd and mwd products and services and specialty chemical sales  are based substantially on technologies for which we hold licenses or patents 
our success in these areas depends to a significant extent on the development and implementation of new product designs and formulations 
whether we can continue to develop products and technologies to meet evolving industry requirements and at prices acceptable to our customers will be a significant factor in determining our ability to compete in these areas 
many of our competitors have greater resources devoted to research and development of new products and technologies than we do 
we are pursuing patent and trademark protection for our newly developed technologies and brands  especially at pathfinder 
the market success of these new technologies will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce exclusive rights in the technologies  to preserve rights in our trade secret and non public information and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
the degree of protection that we can obtain for our technologies and brands is uncertain 
there can be no assurance that particular patents or trademark registrations for which we apply will actually be issued 
further  there can be no assurance that third parties will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies  duplicate any of our technologies or design around or invalidate any patents we obtain 
numerous patents have been issued to oilfield service companies covering a wide variety of products and services 
although we endeavor to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others in bringing new technologies and brands to market  there can be no assurance that third parties will not make claims of infringement 
intellectual property litigation is inherently expensive  whether enforcing our own proprietary rights or defending against the infringement claims of others 
if a commercially significant intellectual property dispute arises  we could incur substantial litigation costs or be subject to claims for damages or injunctive relief 
our lwd business is substantially dependent upon technologies that we acquired when we acquired the pathfinder lwd and related mwd business of halliburton company in march we have the right to use these technologies through non exclusive  worldwide licenses granted to us by halliburton and other third party licensors 
the concentration of our customers in the energy industry could materially and adversely affect our earnings 
substantially all of our customers are in the energy industry 
this concentration of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions 
many of our customers slow the payment of their accounts when industry conditions decline 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers  but do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables 
a significant amount of our growth has occurred through the acquisition of existing businesses  however  future acquisitions may be difficult to integrate  may disrupt our existing businesses and may adversely affect our operating results 
we may acquire other companies  assets and product lines that complement or expand our existing business 
each acquisition  however  involves a number of risks 
these risks include the diversion of our management s attention from our existing businesses to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired business  possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process  and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the combination 
we may seek to finance an acquisition through borrowings under our credit facility or through the issuance of new debt or equity securities 
if we should proceed with a relatively large cash acquisition  we could deplete a substantial portion of our financial resources to the possible detriment of our other operations 
any future acquisitions could also dilute the equity interests of our shareholders  require us to write off assets for accounting purposes or create other undesirable accounting issues 
our international operations may experience interruptions due to political and economic risks 
we operate our business and market our products and services in oil and natural gas producing areas outside the united states 
we are  therefore  subject to the risks common in international operations and investments in foreign countries 
these risks include nationalization and expropriation  war and civil disturbances  restrictive actions by local governments  limitations on repatriation of earnings  changes in foreign tax laws  and changes in currency exchange rates 
the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on regional demand for our products and services or our ability to provide our products and services in a particular region 
an interruption of our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
an impairment of goodwill could reduce our earnings 
our balance sheet as of december   included net goodwill which represented approximately of our total assets 
goodwill is recorded when we pay more for a business than the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to test goodwill for impairment 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
if we were to determine that any of the remaining balance of goodwill was impaired  we would be required to take an immediate charge to earnings with a correlative effect on shareholders equity 
as a holding company  we are totally dependent on dividends from our operating subsidiaries to pay our obligations 
we are a holding company with no business operations 
our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries 
as a result  we must rely on dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
we currently expect that the majority of earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations  including servicing any debt obligations they may now or in the future have 
even if we decided to pay a dividend on or make a distribution in respect of our common stock  our subsidiaries may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend or distribute funds to us 
at present  we are restricted from paying dividends under our credit facility 
future credit facilities and other future debt obligations  as well as statutory provisions  may also limit our ability to pay dividends 
our credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our financial and operational flexibility and our ability to pay dividends 
our credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit the incurrence of debt by our company or our subsidiaries  require us to maintain financial ratios  such as a debt service coverage ratio and leverage ratio  limit the amount of capital expenditures we may make and effectively restrict our ability to pay dividends 
these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to conduct and expand our operations 
for example  our business is capital intensive  requiring specialized equipment and trained personnel to provide our products and services 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms 
even if adequate funds are available  our credit facility may restrict our ability to raise additional funds 
if we are unable to raise capital  our finances and operations may be adversely affected 
risks related to the market for our common stock the availability of shares of our common stock for future sale could depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales might occur  could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we registered the sale of  shares of our common stock which have been and may in the future be issued upon the exercise of options granted under our option plans 
all of the shares issued upon exercise of these options will be freely tradable without restrictions or registration under the securities act of  by persons other than our affiliates 
our affiliates would be able to sell these shares under rule after compliance with any lock up agreement to which they are subject 
our stock price could be extremely volatile as a result of the effect that variations in oil and natural gas prices and other factors beyond our control could have on the market price of our stock 
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors  including variations in our quarterly or annual results of operations  variations in oil and natural gas prices and production inventory levels  investor perceptions of us and other oilfield service companies  in general  general economic conditions  and the liquidity of the market for our common stock 
these factors may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly or decline 
in particular  the market price of our common stock may be influenced by variations in oil and natural gas prices  because demand for our products and services is closely related to the prices of these commodities 
this may cause our stock price to fluctuate with these underlying commodity prices  which are highly volatile

some of these sales offices and facilities are leased from employees who were the former owners of our subsidiaries

item legal proceedings two separate lawsuits  keith vienne  et al v 
conoco  inc  et al  no 
 and larry mouton  et al v 
conoco  inc  et al  no 
 were filed in in louisiana state court against six defendants  including conoco  inc  the primary operator of the field beginning in the s and guillory tank truck service  inc  an oilfield waste disposal company 
one of our subsidiaries  charles holston  inc  purchased the assets of guillory tank truck service  inc 
in these cases have several hundred plaintiffs who allege that they and their property have been exposed to improperly handled oil  gas and oilfield waste over a year period in connection with the operation of an oilfield approximately four miles north of rayne  louisiana 
the plaintiffs allege that guillory tank truck service  inc improperly disposed of oilfield waste from the field at various unspecified times over the years 
the plaintiffs are seeking an unspecified amount of general  special and exemplary damages 
these cases  which are being consolidated for trial purposes  are in the initial phase of discovery and it is too early for us to predict a range of exposure or a likely outcome 
however  we believe that under the terms of the asset purchase agreement entered into in to acquire these assets  charles holston  inc is not contractually liable for any acts which may result in liability prior to the acquisition of these assets 
we do not expect these two lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we are a party to various routine legal proceedings that primarily involve intellectual property  commercial and workers compensation claims 
we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits  legal proceedings and claims with certainty 
nevertheless  we believe that the outcome of all of these proceedings  even if determined adversely  would not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview of the markets for our products and services we are a diversified oilfield service company that provides drilling related products and services  completion and workover related products and services and maintenance and safety related products and services 
our customers include major and independent oil and natural gas companies  other oilfield service companies and refining and petrochemical companies 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of other factors 
any prolonged increase or decrease in oil and natural gas prices affects the levels of exploration  development and production activity as well as the entire health of the oil and natural gas industry 
demand for our drilling related products and services is directly affected by the level of exploration  development and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies 
demand for our completion and workover related products and services depends more on oil and natural gas production activity  which is less immediately affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices 
demand for our maintenance and safety related products and services is affected by the rate of plant overhauls and maintenance turnarounds as well as the overall health of the refining and petrochemical industries and  to a lesser extent  by the level of oil and natural gas exploration  development and production activity 
drilling related products and services revenue from our drilling related products and services segment constituted approximately of our total consolidated revenue 
approximately of our drilling segment revenue was generated in various international locations which include canada  brazil  europe  north africa  the middle east  the persian gulf  the gulf of suez  the mediterranean sea and the north sea 
however  the most significant portion of our drilling segment revenues is generated in the united states  including the gulf of mexico 
in july  exploration and development activity levels in the united states peaked and began to decline primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices 
this decline continued through april  at which point the united states drilling rig count levels reached a low of rig count levels modestly recovered during the remainder of  but remained well below the average activity level of according to statistics published by baker hughes  the average number of rotary rigs operating in the united states was  and for and  respectively 
the decline in exploration and development activity levels in the united states has significantly impacted our revenue and earnings generated in this key market 
natural gas prices increased during and this increase became more pronounced during early due to the colder winter when compared to last year 
however  the increased price level of natural gas has yet to result in a meaningful increase in drilling activity 
we believe that concerns about the united states economy and the war in the middle east are among the factors that have delayed the recovery 
we believe that the overall outlook for natural gas exploration and development activity remains positive as natural gas production continues to decline and natural gas storage levels are now near record low levels which should continue to keep natural gas prices at relatively high levels 
however  the extent and timing of a recovery in drilling activity remains difficult to predict as it may depend on how the factors mentioned above are resolved 
outside of the united states  the north sea remains our largest drilling segment market  particularly for lwd and mwd services 
however  due to the unexpected enactment of a uk tax law imposing a supplementary tax on oil and natural gas profits derived from the north sea  many of our customers have reduced drilling activity in this region 
according to statistics published by baker hughes  the number of rotary rigs operating in the north sea declined from an average of in january to an average of in december we do not expect any marked increase in activity levels in the north sea in the near term 
in october  we made a strategic decision to provide directional drilling services in north america 
directional drilling services include the directing and steering of the path of the well bore by an onsite operator to specific targets in the formation 
we believe that providing this service in the united states will increase the utilization of our lwd  mwd and downhole drilling motor fleet 
prior to october  we only provided directional drilling services in select areas of the eastern hemisphere 
completion and workover related products and services this sector is our second largest business segment and provided approximately of our total consolidated revenue 
revenues provided by the completion and workover segment are almost exclusively derived from the united states and the gulf of mexico 
although activity levels in the completion and workover of existing oil and natural gas wells are linked to commodity prices  our completion segment is less commodity price sensitive than our drilling segment 
as a result  our completion and workover segment has and continues to provide stability during prolonged downturns in drilling activity 
we have increased our revenue capacity in this segment through capital spending in and which  when combined with our acquisitions of cts in may  boyd s in august and e 
m 
hobbs in november  has strengthened and further diversified our completion and workover segment 
maintenance and safety related products and services our maintenance and safety segment provided approximately of our total consolidated revenue and is focused entirely in and along the gulf coast region of the united states 
although somewhat seasonal in nature  with higher activity levels in the early and late portions of the year  this segment is primarily dependent upon the maintenance activity levels of refineries and petrochemical plants and to a lesser extent on the level of exploration  development and production activity 
during  we experienced a decrease in turnaround activity in the petrochemical industry 
adverse weather conditions our results of operations were negatively impacted by the effects of adverse weather conditions brought on by tropical storm isidore  hurricane lili and the related wet weather conditions along the gulf coast 
the impact of these adverse weather conditions began near the end of the third quarter of and continued through the early part of the fourth quarter 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to reduced activity levels within the oil and natural gas industry  including the effects of softness in pricing  partially offset by the revenue contribution of boyd s  which was acquired in august and hobbs  which was acquired in november and the full year effect of cts  which was acquired in may additionally  our results of operations in were negatively impacted by the effects of the adverse weather conditions previously discussed 
revenues from our drilling related products and services decreased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in drilling activity  including the effects of softness in pricing and the adverse weather conditions previously discussed 
revenues from our completion and workover related products and services increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue increased as a result of the revenue contributions of boyd s and hobbs  which were acquired in august and november  respectively  and the full year effect of cts  which was acquired in may  but was offset by the effects of lower activity levels  pricing and the adverse weather conditions previously discussed 
revenues from our maintenance and safety related products and services decreased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the amount of turnaround activity in the petrochemical industry 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was due to the effects of softness in pricing and lower utilization of our equipment and services during a period of reduced drilling and workover activity levels  as well as increased insurance costs 
in addition  our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was negatively impacted by our strategy of maintaining an optimal level of staffing and infrastructure to ensure that we are capable of benefiting fully from future increases in industry activity levels  as well as the adverse weather conditions previously discussed 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to additional expenses related to the operations of boyd s and hobbs  which were acquired in august and november  respectively  the full year effect of cts  which was acquired in may and increases in insurance costs  partially offset by a reduction in sales incentives  bonuses and marketing expenses resulting from the decreased activity levels within the oil and natural gas industry 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   partially due to our strategy of maintaining an optimal level of staffing and infrastructure to ensure that we are capable of benefiting fully from future increases in industry activity levels 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of increased research and development spending on our mwd lwd and related technologies 
we believe it is necessary to maintain our investment in developing new technologies during the current downturn in drilling to ensure that we are capable of benefiting fully from future increases in industry activity levels 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of depreciation associated with our continued capital expenditures  as well as additional depreciation and amortization due to our acquisitions of boyd s and hobbs and the full year effect of cts  which was acquired in may interest and other expense 
interest and other expense for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year december  the decrease was primarily due to an overall reduction of interest rates 
net income 
net income for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million reported for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to increased activity levels within the oil and natural gas industry  higher asset utilization  our international expansion effort and the benefit of additional equipment  as well as the effects from our acquisition of cts in may revenues from our drilling related products and services increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in drilling activity  higher asset utilization rates  our international expansion effort and the benefit of additional equipment 
revenues from our completion and workover related products and services increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue increased as a result of an increase in workover rig activity  the benefit of additional equipment  as well as the effects from our acquisition of cts in may revenues from our maintenance and safety related products and services increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of plant overhauls and turnarounds and the benefit of additional equipment 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   due to a significant portion of our costs being fixed 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to our expansion of sales  administration and marketing personnel in and  as well as the effects from our acquisition of cts in may as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   due to a significant portion of our costs being fixed 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of increased research and development spending on our mwd lwd and related technologies 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of depreciation associated with our increased capital expenditures  as well as the effects from our acquisition of cts in may interest and other expense 
interest and other expense for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or approximately  from million for the year december  the decrease was primarily due to our significant debt reduction in october funded by our ipo 
net income loss 
net income for the year ended december  was million  an improvement of million  from the million loss reported for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
further  we regularly review outstanding receivables and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  we make judgments regarding our customers ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
we have made significant investments in inventory and rental equipment to service our customers around the world 
on a routine basis  we use judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory and rental equipment at the lower of cost or market 
our estimates are primarily influenced by technological innovations  market activity levels and the physical condition of products 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory and rental equipment 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of our net assets 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
in certain cases  we have established reserves to reduce deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and retentions under self insurance programs 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  any impairment is measured based on projected net cash flows expected to result from that asset  including eventual disposition

we do not expect the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources our primary uses for cash are working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and principal and interest payments on indebtedness 
to the extent our cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and principal and interest payments on indebtedness exceed cash flow from operations  we must finance our cash requirements primarily through debt and equity financing activities 
working capital was million as of december  and million as of december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  decreases in working capital and cash flow from operating activities are principally the result of decreased operating activity 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was principally the result of our capital expenditures program and the acquisitions of hobbs  boyd s  us clay and cts  which were acquired in november  august  april and may  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to proceeds obtained through our revolving credit facility that was utilized to finance the boyd s and em hobbs acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily from the increase in our credit facility to finance the cts acquisition and a total of million in proceeds obtained from our june public offering of million shares of our common stock and from the proceeds of the exercise of warrants by the holders thereof 
with the exception of the operating leases on real property and automobiles discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  we have no off balance sheet debt or other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we currently have not entered into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the following table aggregates information about our contractual cash obligations in thousands as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years debt     operating leases     total     on may   in connection with our acquisition of cts  we amended and restated our million credit facility to increase our available borrowing capacity to million 
our amended and restated credit facility includes the following features a million term a loan facility that will amortize over five years  will mature on october  and will require that we make annual principal repayments ranging from of the original loan amount in the first year of the credit facility to of the original loan amount on october   a million term b original loan facility that will amortize over six and one half years  will mature on april  and will require that we make annual principal repayments of of the original loan amount in each of the first six years of the credit facility with the outstanding balance due on april   and a million revolving credit facility that may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed from time to time and will mature on october  in accordance with our credit agreement  we exercised our option and obtained an additional revolving loan commitment of million on january  and an additional supplemental term b loan of million on march  the quarterly payment of the supplemental term b loan has been increased by  corresponding to this increase in the amount outstanding 
at our option  amounts borrowed under the credit facility will bear interest at either a variable rate equal to the reserve adjusted libor or an alternate base rate  plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the applicable margin ranges from to in the case of a libor based loan under the revolving credit facility or the term a loan facility and is in the case of a libor based loan under the term b loan facility 
for alternate base rate loans  the applicable margin ranges from to under the revolving credit facility and the term a loan facility and is under the term b loan facility 
the foregoing margins are subject to adjustment based on a debt service coverage ratio and a leverage ratio 
our credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our property and assets  a pledge of all of the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of not greater than of the capital stock of each of our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  our credit facility is guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility requires  among other things  that we maintain certain financial ratios and limits the amount of capital expenditures we may make  the amount of debt we may incur outside of the credit facility  our ability to pay dividends and future investments 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of million  of which million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
in connection with the cts acquisition in may  we issued million in convertible subordinated notes to eight of the individuals from whom we acquired cts as partial consideration for the acquisition 
these notes bear interest at per annum  payment of which is due quarterly 
these notes mature on december  the holders of these notes may convert the notes into shares of common stock within days of maturity at a rate of shares of common stock for each of principal  subject to adjustment based upon various factors 
we may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity with no prepayment penalty 
however  the holders of these notes would have the option to exercise the conversion feature prior to redemption by us 
for the year ended december   we made capital expenditures  primarily for additional rental tool inventory  additional lwd and mwd tools  wireline equipment and coiled tubing units  of million  including expenditures for the replacement of equipment lost in hole 
in addition  we incurred million in research and development expenses for the year ended december  we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds for our identified capital projects  debt service and working capital requirements 
however  part of our strategy involves the acquisition of companies that have products and services complementary to our existing strategic base of operations 
depending on the size of any future acquisitions  we may require additional debt financing  possibly in excess of the limits of our credit facility  or additional equity financing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
we currently have not entered into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our market risk could arise from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates 
assuming our current level of borrowings  a basis point increase in the interest rate applicable to these borrowings would have increased our interest expense by approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  foreign currency exchange risk 
our earnings and financial position are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we currently do not hedge against foreign currency translation risks and we believe that foreign currency exchange risk is not significant to our operations
