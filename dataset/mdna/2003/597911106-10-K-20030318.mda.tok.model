capacity  as measured by scheduled service available seat miles asms  increased in capacity decreased at midwest but increased at midwest connect 
midwest s capacity decreased due to the retirement of one dc aircraft in the second quarter and the sale of two dc aircraft in the fourth quarter 
midwest connect s capacity increase was due to the addition of two new regional jets in scheduled service  as well as the fact that a number of midwest routes were shifted to smaller midwest connect aircraft to more efficiently handle decreased passenger levels 
traffic  as measured by revenue passenger miles  increased 
load factor increased from in to in the company s total revenue in decreased million  or  from to million 
the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue yield passenger revenue per revenue passenger mile

the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  future results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are policies that reflect material judgment and uncertainty and may result in materially different results using different assumptions or conditions 
the company identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition  frequent flyer revenue and impairment of long lived assets 
for a detailed discussion of accounting policies  refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition passenger revenue  related commissions  if any  and cargo revenues are recognized in the period when the service is provided 
a portion of the revenue from the sale of frequent flyer mileage credit is deferred and recognized straight line over months 
contract maintenance revenue is recognized when work is completed and invoiced 
the estimated liability for sold  but unused  tickets is included in current liabilities as air traffic liability 
the amount of commissions associated with unearned revenue is included in current assets as prepaid commissions 
frequent flyer revenue effective january   the company adopted staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december sab provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
prior to the issuance of sab  the company recognized all revenue from frequent flyer miles sold to partners  net of the incremental cost of providing future air travel  when the mileage credits were sold  which was consistent with most major airlines 
beginning january   as a result of adopting sab  the company changed its method used to account for participating partners such as credit card companies  hotels and car rental agencies 
under the new accounting method  a portion of the revenue from the sale of frequent flyer mileage credits is deferred and recognized straight line over months 
the company believes the method appropriately matches revenues with the period in which services are provided 
the estimated incremental cost of providing future transportation in conjunction with travel miles under the company s frequent flyer program is accrued based on estimated redemption percentages applied to actual mileage recorded in members accounts 
the ultimate cost will depend on the actual redemption of frequent flyer miles  and may be greater or less than amounts accrued at december  impairment of long lived assets the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount 
during the second quarter  the company decided to accelerate the retirement of eight midwest dc aircraft 
in connection with this decision  the company performed evaluations to determine  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  whether future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these aircraft would be less than the aggregate carrying amounts 
in determining the fair market value of these assets  the company considered market trends in aircraft dispositions  data from third parties and management estimates 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
became effective for the company on january   and superseded sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
under sfas no 
 if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
in addition  sfas no 
allows the analysis to be applied to a group of assets 
for long lived assets to be abandoned  the remaining depreciable life of the long lived asset may need to be revised 
for long lived assets to be sold  sfas no 
clarifies the classification of the long lived asset and the criteria for such treatment 
during the first quarter  the company decided to accelerate the retirement of the dc fleet of midwest in anticipation of accelerated deliveries of boeing aircraft 
consequently  in the first quarter the cost bases of these assets were reduced to reflect the fair market value at the date of the decision  and the remaining depreciable lives were adjusted for the new retirement schedule  in accordance with sfas no 
in determining the fair market value of these assets  the company considered market trends in aircraft dispositions  data from third parties and management estimates 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled million including million of restricted cash  as discussed more fully below at december   compared with million at december  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in net cash used in investing activities totaled million in net cash provided by financing activities in totaled million due primarily to proceeds received from a private equity placement and funding associated with the pre delivery progress payments related to the company s new boeing aircraft program  partially offset by the payment of principal under the bank credit facility each as discussed below 
the company s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled million at march  the company s restricted cash and cash equivalents at march  totaled an additional million 
as of december   the company had a working capital deficit of million compared with a million deficit on december  the improvement in the working capital deficit can be attributed to the receipt of million of cash proceeds associated with the fairchild arbitration settlement and million in net proceeds from the private placement of the company s common stock 
the working capital deficit is primarily due to the company s air traffic liability which represents deferred revenue for advance bookings  whereby passengers have purchased tickets for future flights and revenue is recognized when the passenger travels and frequent flyer program liability which represents deferred revenue and accrued costs associated with future travel 
because of this  the company expects to operate at a working capital deficit  which is not unusual for the industry 
in june  the company generated gross proceeds of million through the private placement of  shares of the company s common stock to qualified institutional investors at per share 
net proceeds  after commission and expenses  of million were used to reduce indebtedness 
because of the equity financing  the company decided not to apply for a federal loan guarantee pursuant to the air transportation safety and system stabilization act 
on october   the company amended the agreement relating to its bank credit facility 
under the amended agreement  the company has a bank credit facility  the amount of which declines in tranches from million in october to million in mid april  compared with million in availability prior to amending the credit agreement 
at december   the credit facility was million  as of february   the credit facility was million 
the credit agreement  scheduled to expire august   is secured with certain exceptions by substantially all non aircraft personal property assets of the company  by certain aircraft and by a second priority lien on the company s headquarters facility 
the fees and borrowing costs under the amended credit agreement are higher than they were prior to october  the interest rate on borrowings under the facility is prime plus basis points 
the credit agreement requires monthly compliance with certain financial covenants 
primarily due to increasing fuel prices  the company did not meet the financial covenants as of january  and obtained a waiver of the covenant default 
the company did not meet the financial covenants as of february  in addition  the company s action to suspend payments to lessors and certain other creditors announced march   will result in a default under the terms of the credit agreement 
the company is in discussions with the banks to attempt to resolve the situation 
the company anticipates that the banks will provide a waiver of the defaults  but there is no assurance that the company will be successful in these negotiations 
as of december   the company had borrowings under the facility totaling million 
in addition  the company had letters of credit totaling approximately million outstanding under the credit facility  reducing the available credit by that amount 
the letters of credit are primarily used to support financing of the company s maintenance facilities 
as of march   the company had borrowings under the facility totaling million 
in addition  the company had letters of credit totaling approximately million outstanding under the credit facility  reducing the available credit by that amount 
the company intends to fund the million reduction in the amount of the credit facility by mid april from existing cash and cash equivalents 
the company has agreements with organizations that process credit card transactions arising from purchases of air travel tickets by customers of the company 
the company has one such agreement with an organization that processes mastercard visa transactions  this organization is also a lender under the bank credit facility 
credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel in the future because although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to the company soon after the purchase is completed  the air travel generally occurs after that time and the processor would have liability if the company does not ultimately deliver the travel 
the agreement with the organization that processes mastercard visa transactions was amended in january to allow the credit card processor to create and maintain a reserve account that is funded by retaining cash that it otherwise would deliver to the company ie  restricted cash 
as a result of this amendment  the credit card processor has retained cash representing percent of the credit card processor s risk exposure determined on a daily basis  or million of the million of restricted cash as of december  the percent level is the maximum that the credit card processor may withhold unless a specified triggering event occurs under the credit card processing agreement  at which time the credit card processor may increase the reserve to percent of its risk exposure 
the triggering events include failure of the company to meet certain liquidity or leverage type covenants  breaches of the company s obligations under the card processing agreement  default under the bank credit facility and certain defaults of other indebtedness of the company 
the company met all required credit card processing agreement covenants during the company did not meet the financial covenants for january or february in addition  the company s action to suspend payments to lessors and certain other creditors announced march   will result in a default under the terms of the credit card processing agreement 
the company obtained a waiver from the card processor for the january financial covenant defaults  and the company is in discussions with the credit card processor to attempt to resolve the current situation 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in those negotiations 
the credit card processing agreement is secured by a second priority lien  with certain exceptions  on substantially all non aircraft personal property assets of the company and certain aircraft and by a third priority lien on the company s headquarters facility 
it is likely  if current industry conditions persist  that other credit card processors may require a holdback as well 
the aggregate amount of the risk exposure of the other processors as of march  was approximately million 
the company offers the midwest airlines mastercard program 
during the year  the company transitioned the program from elan financial services to juniper bank under an agreement effective july  the program allows midwest airlines to offer a co branded credit card to enhance loyalty to the airline and to increase frequent flyer membership 
the company generates income by selling frequent flyer program miles to juniper bank  which in turn awards the miles to cardholders for purchases made with their credit cards 
in early fourth quarter  juniper bank paid the company million in accordance with the agreement between the parties 
in essence  this payment is in part the payment of a minimum amount due for the period from july  to the date of the payment and in part the prepayment of a minimum amount due for the period from the date of payment through june  the company is recognizing revenue under the agreement subject to the company s revenue recognition policies for frequent flyer miles based on actual credit card purchase and mileage credit activity rather than on the receipt of these or similar cash payments that the agreement may obligate juniper bank to make 
accordingly  the company is reflecting deferred revenue on its balance sheet based on the amount by which the cash the company has received under the agreement exceeds the revenue the company has recognized under the company s revenue recognition policy 
as of december   the deferred revenue was million 
capital spending totaled million for the months ended december  capital expenditures consisted primarily of refurbishment of an md aircraft  engine overhauls and spare parts  boeing start up requirements  capitalized aircraft spare parts  an engine overhaul and technology investments 
during  the company made pre delivery progress payments of million for the new boeing aircraft program  of which million was funded under a loan agreement with kreditanstalt fur wiederaufbau bank kfw  guaranteed by rolls royce deutschland ltd 
co 
kg 
the loan agreement provides up to million in pre delivery progress payment financing 
under a financing commitment between the company and boeing capital corporation bcc  at each aircraft delivery date bcc will acquire and pay for the aircraft delivered  including interest accrued on the debt owed kfw  and bcc will then lease the aircraft to the company 
at that time  bcc will reimburse the company in full for the pre delivery progress payments the company has made 
to the extent the company funded such payments through kfw  the company will use the amounts reimbursed to repay the related debt to kfw 
to the extent the company originally funded such payments with operating cash  the amounts reimbursed will represent available cash 
with the loan agreement with kfw bank and the bcc commitment  the company believes it has requisite financing for the boeing program 
although bcc is able to terminate its financing commitment if it deems the company has experienced a material adverse change and the commitment is subject to other conditions  the company does not anticipate that the financing commitment will be terminated or that the company will be unable to meet the conditions 
in june  one md series aircraft was debt financed for seven years at a fixed interest rate 
in july  the company completed a sale and leaseback of another md series aircraft  for a year term 
three jets were debt financed in  each for a period up to months at fixed interest rates ranging from to for the first to months 
the interest rates revert to a variable rate for the last few months of the financing agreement 
the company will attempt to refinance these jet regional jets for longer terms when the initial financing comes due in august and november for two jets and in january for the third 
the company s ability to refinance these jets will be dependent in part on the then current fair market value of the jets and the company s financial position 
as of march   the company believes that the aggregate value of these jets is less than the aggregate amount of the associated indebtedness by approximately million 
the company s board of directors has authorized a million common stock repurchase program

the company maintains a qualified defined benefit plan  the pilots supplemental pension plan the qualified plan  which provides supplemental retirement benefits to midwest pilots  and an unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plan to provide midwest pilots with annuity benefits for salary in excess of amounts permitted to be paid under the provisions of the tax law to participants in the qualified plan 
additionally  the company has entered into individual employment agreements with certain current and former executives providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits

the embraer regional jet program  with deliveries scheduled to begin in january  requires less significant pre delivery payments than the boeing program but will require long term financing on or after delivery 
the company believes long term financing will be difficult to obtain given current industry conditions and company financial results  and is in discussions with embraer to defer the deliveries of these aircraft 
the following table of material debt and lease commitments at december   summarizes the effect these obligations are expected to have on the company s cash flow in the future periods set forth below in thousands related cash outflows contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt excluding interest        aircraft operating leases        non aircraft operating leases        commitments        all capital leases total        note above table includes commitments related to the boeing and embraer aircraft programs 
on march   the company announced that it was suspending aircraft lease and debt payments associated with the company s dc  md  jet and beech aircraft until june  the suspension is intended to provide the company opportunity to negotiate a restructuring of the terms and conditions of the leases and other financial obligations with the lessors and other affected creditors to bring them in line with market conditions and better reflect the reduced market values of the aircraft 
payments being suspended total approximately million 
because the company suspended the payments without the assent of the lessors and other affected creditors  the suspension of payments will result in defaults under the terms of the applicable leases and debt obligations  and will also result in defaults under the terms of the company s bank credit agreement and the company s credit card processing agreement for mastercard visa transactions  potentially resulting in an increase of the reserve under that agreement to of the card processor s exposure  and is likely to result in defaults of other contractual obligations 
such defaults give the other parties to these arrangements certain rights and remedies 
although the company will negotiate as to the consequences of the defaults with the relevant parties  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in those negotiations 
as discussed more fully in the business environment section  going forward there are numerous uncertainties associated with the company s liquidity position going forward 
financial results and cash flow from operations can vary significantly depending on the price of fuel  the general economic condition of the country  and the acts undertaken by other airlines in the industry with regard to capacity and pricing 
the company is attempting to solve immediate liquidity issues by implementing measures to reduce costs 
many actions have been taken  while others require the participation of labor unions representing certain of the company s employees and aircraft lessors and debt providers 
in addition  the company is seeking liquidity from other sources including government sources and significant suppliers 
there is no assurance  however  that the company s short and long term liquidity issues will be resolved without a substantial restructuring of its business and contracts and an overall improvement in the conditions within the industry 
to successfully restructure the company  the company may need to pursue alternative restructuring scenarios  including judicial restructuring 
pending developments md series aircraft the company has one remaining owned md series aircraft that has not been placed in service 
the refurbishment process for this aircraft began in third quarter the company expects to place this aircraft in service in early second quarter boeing aircraft in april  the company announced that it had amended its boeing aircraft order 
the company placed a firm order for new boeing aircraft  with purchase rights for an additional aircraft 
the firm order is valued at million 
under the amended purchase agreement  delivery of the aircraft began in february and will continue into at a rate of one aircraft every month 
the first boeing aircraft is expected to enter scheduled service in march these aircraft will be used to replace midwest s dc aircraft and expand service in existing and new markets 
the purchase will significantly affect the company s cost structure by adding higher fixed costs because the boeing aircraft will have higher ownership costs ie  purchase costs and lease payment expenses than the company s dc aircraft 
benefits of the boeing aircraft  which would not be fixed in amount  include greater fuel efficiency  lower maintenance costs  improved dispatch reliability  increased aircraft utilization  reduced regulatory compliance costs  and higher revenues through potential increased demand for air travel due to the fact that the company is using these aircraft 
there is no assurance that the benefits of the boeing aircraft will outweigh the costs associated with these aircraft 
the company s current report on form k dated june  and filed june  discusses additional risks concerning the boeing program 
regional jet aircraft in april  the company signed a memorandum of understanding placing firm orders for new embraer regional jets  with options to purchase additional aircraft 
the firm order is valued at million 
in august  the parties signed a purchase agreement related to this order 
under this purchase agreement  delivery of the aircraft was scheduled to begin in january in october  due to ramifications of the events of september  the company reached an agreement with embraer to delay deliveries of the first aircraft to january for similar reasons  the company reached further agreement with embraer in march to delay delivery of the first aircraft until january this delay was intended to allow the company to concentrate on the introduction of boeing aircraft to the midwest fleet and provide additional time for the company to evaluate financing alternatives 
the company plans to use the new embraer regional jets to expand service in existing and new markets 
because the regional jets are produced in three sizes  they are expected to provide midwest connect with flexibility to serve markets with differing capacity demands 
the embraer regional jet program requires less significant pre delivery payments than the boeing program but will require long term financing on or after delivery 
the company believes long term financing will be difficult to obtain given current industry conditions and company financial results  and is in discussions with embraer to further defer the deliveries of these aircraft 
labor relations in june  midwest connect began negotiating with its pilots that are represented by the air line pilots association alpa  a collective bargaining labor union 
the midwest connect pilots contract became amendable in january the company and alpa are currently in negotiations for a new contract

the company is currently in discussions with its labor unions regarding cost concessions as part of the internal restructuring initiative 
see further discussion above in the business environment section

the company plans to adopt sfas no 
on january  the company has not completed its assessment of the impact of sfas no 
on its consolidated financial statements  but does not expect it to have a material impact on future financial statements or results of operations

sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide three alternative methods of transition to sfas no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation for companies that elect to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
does not require transition to sfas no 
sfas amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and apb no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are required to be adopted by all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether the accounting for stock based compensation is by the fair value method of sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method of apb no 
the company is currently reviewing sfas no 
s impact on future financial statements or results of operations 
the company does not anticipate adopting the direct expense method of accounting for stock based compensation  and is planning to continue using the disclosure method 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees 
it also clarifies that at the time a guarantee is issued  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
fin does not apply to certain guarantee contracts  such as those issued by insurance companies or for a lessee s residual value guarantee embedded in a capital lease 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations would not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   regardless of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements in fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company does not expect fin to have a material impact on future financial statements or results of operations 
insurance due to the events of september   aviation insurance carriers have significantly increased the premiums for aviation insurance  as well as hull and war risk coverage insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events 
under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act  us air carriers may purchase certain war risk liability insurance from the united states government on an interim basis at rates that are more favorable than those available from private aviation insurance carriers 
the company has received an extension of this war risk liability insurance through april  the company expects to receive day extensions of this coverage through august  commercial air carriers are required by the department of transportation to obtain appropriate aviation insurance coverage 
the effects of september insurance losses  additional terrorist attacks or other unanticipated events could result in aviation insurers further increasing their premiums  or a future shortage of available aviation insurance 
significant increases in insurance premiums or a shortage of available insurance could result in the curtailment or discontinuation of scheduled service 
security changes by december   the transportation security administration tsa required airlines to implement changes to baggage screening and positive bag match at all airports 
the full impact of these changes on the company s passengers is not currently known  but may lead to increased processing time for traveling passengers 
the full impact on the company s revenue and costs is also unknown at this time 
currently  midwest airlines offers conventional passenger check in options that include ticket counter and skycap service for bag check in only 
as of december  passengers who do not check their luggage can no longer check in at the gate 
although gate check in helped reduce ticket counter lines  tsa eliminated this option to simplify passenger screening at the security checkpoint 
all passengers are now required to obtain a boarding pass prior to entering the security checkpoint 
effective december  tsa required baggage screening 
due to the size and location of the screening equipment  the baggage screening requirement has decreased the amount of space available for passenger lines at the ticket counter 
at the same time  passenger lines in the same area have increased due to the boarding pass requirement 
the company has implemented a number of strategies to decrease passenger wait times  including a boarding pass only check in space in the milwaukee airport  and the kiosk and internet check in options discussed below 
self service kiosks in february  the company set up three check in kiosks at the milwaukee airport 
passengers are able to obtain their boarding pass directly from the kiosk 
it is expected this change will ease passenger congestion near the lower level ticket counters 
the company expects to install kiosks in kansas city  washington national  new york la guardia and boston 
enhanced skycap service  including the issuance of boarding passes  will be implemented in milwaukee  kansas city  washington national  orlando and dallas 
these additional check in options are also expected to expedite the passenger check in process 
the company expects kiosk technology will make it possible to add check in positions without increasing labor costs 
in addition  the company began offering internet check in effective march  which provides customers with an alternative method of obtaining their boarding passes 
low fare product on february   the company announced the launch of a low fare product focusing on the leisure market 
service on this product is expected to be initiated in the third quarter it is expected that the low fare product will complement the company s existing premium midwest and regional midwest connect products by offering flights to high demand leisure destinations at the lower fares leisure travelers want to pay 
the decision to offer a low fare product was based upon extensive market research 
the company expects to initiate service with five md aircraft currently part of the midwest fleet in a high density seating configuration that will seat passengers in a three by two configuration in a single class cabin 
pitch will average inches  similar to midwest airlines and more than other low fare carriers 
the low fare brand is expected to enhance the company s competitive position by serving a segment of the market that is growing more rapidly than the business travel market  expand to destinations that have not been economically viable to serve with the premium product  and serve some existing destinations more cost efficiently 
suspension of payments on march   the company disclosed that it suspended lease and debt payments associated with its dc  md  jet and beech aircraft until june  the suspension is intended to provide the company the opportunity to negotiate a restructuring of the terms and conditions of the leases and other financial obligations with the lessors and other affected creditors to bring them in line with market conditions and better reflect the reduced market values of the aircraft 
because the company suspended the payments without the assent of the lessors and other affected creditors  the suspension of payments will result in defaults under the terms of the applicable leases and debt obligations  and the suspension will also result in a default under the terms of the company s bank credit agreement and the company s credit card processing agreement for mastercard visa transactions  potentially resulting in an increase of the reserve under that agreement to of the card processor s exposure and is likely to result in defaults of other contractual obligations 
such defaults give the other parties to these arrangements certain rights and remedies 
although the company will negotiate as to the consequences of the defaults with the relevant parties  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in those negotiations
