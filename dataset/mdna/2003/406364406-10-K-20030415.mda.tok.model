as a result of the fluctuations in the anticipated gain on the sale of the hrp limited partner units  the realization of a gain on the sale of hallwood energy  and the projected income from operations  partially offset by the decline in value and disposition of the company s hotel properties  management has determined that the deferred tax asset should be adjusted to reflect the anticipated utilization of nols resulting from the expected income from these assumptions 
accordingly the company recorded a deferred tax expense of  in and  in  and deferred tax benefit of  in  respectively  which resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets of  at december    at december  and  at december  the portion of the deferred tax expense benefit during the years ended december   and related to continuing operations was   and  respectively  and the portion relating to discontinued operations was   and  respectively

requires that the tax benefit of such nols be recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such nols to be more likely than not 
based upon the company s expectations and available tax planning strategies  management has determined that taxable income will more likely than not be sufficient to utilize approximately  of the nols prior to their ultimate expiration in the year management believes that the company has certain tax planning strategies available  which include the potential sale of certain real estate investments  that could be implemented  if necessary  to supplement income from operations to fully realize the net recorded tax benefits before their expiration 
management has considered such strategies in reaching its conclusion that  more likely than not  taxable income will be sufficient to utilize a portion of the nols before expiration  however  future levels of operating income and taxable gains are dependent upon general economic conditions and other factors beyond the company s control 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated for utilization of the nols 
management periodically re evaluates its tax planning strategies based upon changes in facts and circumstances and  accordingly  considers potential adjustments to the valuation allowance of the deferred tax asset 
although the use of such carryforwards could  under certain circumstances be limited  the company is presently unaware of the occurrence of any event which would result in such limitations 
in addition  utilization of nols in the future may be limited if changes in the company s stock ownership create a change of control  as provided in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in december  the sec requested that registrants identify critical accounting policies in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that the following of its accounting policies fit this description revenue recognition fee income from real estate operations is recognized as the services eg management  leasing  acquisition  construction are performed in accordance with various service agreements 
the company records a non cash adjustment for the elimination of intercompany profits associated with leasing and construction supervision fees earned from hrp to the extent of their ownership interest in hrp

equity method of accounting the company accounts for its investments in hrp and hec  using the equity method of accounting

the company records its pro rata share of each entity s net income loss adjusted for certain items  such as the elimination of intercompany profits  as well as a pro rata share of partners capital and stockholders equity transactions and comprehensive income 
impairment of long lived assets the company s management routinely reviews its investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the fair value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
in the event such indicators exist for assets held for use  if undiscounted cash flows before interest charges are less than carrying value  the asset is written down to estimated fair value 
for assets held for sale  these assets are carried at the lower of cost or estimated sales price less costs of sale 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
significant assumptions used in this process depend upon the nature of the investment  but would include an evaluation of the future business opportunities  sources of competition  advancement of technology and its impact on patents and processes  future rental and occupancy rates  and the level of expected operating expenses 
inventories inventories at the brookwood subsidiary are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or specific identification method or market 
inventories are reviewed and adjusted for changes in market value based on assumptions related to future demand and worldwide and local market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions vary from those projected by management  adjustments to lower of cost or market value may be required 
the policies listed are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in the application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result than those recorded and reported
