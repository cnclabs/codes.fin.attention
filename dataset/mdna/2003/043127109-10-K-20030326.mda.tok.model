item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as well as the section under the heading risk factors that may affect future results 
with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed below may include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of that involves risks and uncertainties 
we caution readers that a number of important factors  including those identified in the section entitled risk factors that may affect future results as well as factors discussed in our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission  could affect our actual results and cause them to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
many forward looking statements included in this form k are made only as of the date hereof  based on information available as of the date hereof  and subject to applicable law to the contrary  we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the impact and any associated risk related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue and the related costs of sales when risk of loss and title are passed to the customer  which is generally as products are shipped and as services are provided 
provisions for estimated returns and sales allowances are established concurrently with the recognition of revenue and are based on a variety of factors including actual return and sales allowance history and projected economic conditions 
we regularly monitor customer inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when management believes actual product returns or other allowances may differ from established reserves 
while actual return and allowance rates have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in returns or sales allowances could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such provisions materialize 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
we believe this is a critical accounting estimate because changes in the reserve can materially effect net income and it requires us to forecast the amount of write offs in a particular period  which can be highly uncertain 
the estimate of expected write offs is critical in both segments 
our allowance has decreased in the last two years as a result of our decreased level of business activity 
we would not expect the allowance to increase until our revenue level increases 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowances of million  as of december   and million  net of allowances of million  as of december  inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or its current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
we consult with our sales and customer service organizations and review sales history in order to determine the projections for each component and finished good 
as demonstrated during and  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly  making this estimate highly uncertain 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in both of these situations  because of the magnitude of the value of our inventory  a material adjustment to the excess and obsolete inventory could be recorded 
for these reasons  we consider this to be a critical accounting estimate 
the estimate of inventory reserves is critical in both of our segments 
in addition  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued in the future  we would be required to recognize such costs as part of our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we would be required to recognize additional operating income 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated change in demand or technological development could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in response to industry trends toward shorter product lifecycles and other factors  we refined the calculation related to estimating our excess and obsolete inventory valuation reserves 
the refinement resulted in an increase to our excess and obsolete inventory reserve of million in the fourth quarter of the increase was primarily to provide reserve for inventories in excess of twelve months demand 
we will continue to evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to excess and obsolete inventory to ensure that we are reflecting an accurate representation of our inventory as it relates to customer demand 
at december   our inventory valuation reserve balance was million  representing of the value of our gross inventory 
this compares to million  or  of gross inventory at the end of warranties we offer warranties of various lengths to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective products returned to us during such warranty period at no cost to the customer 
at the time of sale  we record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual historical warranty costs and communications with our customers 
we believe the accounting estimates related to warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because changes in such estimates can have a material effect on net income and requires us to forecast expected warranty claims  which can be highly uncertain 
the estimate of warranty obligations is critical in both segments 
historically  our warranty costs have been made up of the labor and material required to repair the parts returned 
we have recognized expenses related to warranty costs of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in product warranty claims  a catastrophic incident with the manufacture or design of a key product  or a significant increase in the costs to repair our products could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize 
goodwill we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
in the first quarter of with the adoption of sfas no 
 we assess our goodwill balances using a two step approach on an annual basis or more frequently whenever indicators of impairment exist 
sfas no 
requires that if the fair value of a reporting unit s assets is less than the carrying value of those assets  an impairment of goodwill must be recognized on the income statement 
the amount of the impairment recognized is calculated by subtracting the implied fair value of the goodwill from the carrying value 
during  due to adverse business conditions in our end markets  operating performance in did not meet our initial expectations 
in addition  our stock price had fallen dramatically during the year  indicating the implied value of the company had declined 
based on these trends  our earnings forecasts were revised and we performed an updated assessment of impairment of goodwill 
as a result of this assessment  we recognized an impairment loss in the power conversion segment of million and a loss in the communications products segment of million during the third quarter of the fair value of each reporting unit was determined by an independent third party using the present value of expected future cash flows 
as of december   the balance of goodwill was million  which relates exclusively to our communications products segment  making our estimate of future earnings critical to this segment 
we will continue to assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
in future periods 
we believe the accounting estimates related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the forecast of future cash flows is highly susceptible to change in future periods  and is therefore considered highly uncertain 
management s assumptions about future sales and cash flows require significant judgment as prices and volumes fluctuate due to changing business conditions 
furthermore  the impact of recognizing goodwill impairment charges could be material to our consolidated financial results 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  which make this estimate highly uncertain 
a change in these estimates could have a material effect on our operating results 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
during  we established a valuation allowance of approximately million related to our deferred tax assets in hungary 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of the valuation allowance  and million  net of the valuation allowance  at the end of stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees using the intrinsic value method 
in accordance with apb  as the exercise price of artesyn s stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation cost has been recognized for its fixed stock option plans 
we have chosen  as of this date  that we will not apply the principles of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 to recognize compensation cost related to the grant of stock options using the fair value method 
if we were to adopt the fair value method  its application could be material to our results of operations in any given period 
results of operations compared to consolidated sales 
sales for the fiscal year ended december  were million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in sales is primarily the result of a continued decrease in demand we experienced from most of our major customers starting in early the decreased level of demand continued throughout and accelerated during the latter half of the year 
while we experienced stabilization in demand in some of our markets during  all of our end markets contributed to the decline 
our initial indications are that we should not expect any significant increase in our level of revenue in the first half of while we do expect to experience some growth in the second half of in comparison to the second half of  the increase in revenue is expected to be modest and is dependent on growth in our customers end markets and a reduction in our customers levels of inventory 
the reduction in sales was also impacted by the sale of artesyn solutions in the fourth quarter of during  we recorded sales from artesyn solutions of million in our consolidated results 
if the impact of artesyn solutions is removed from  the reduction in sales in compared to would be million  or 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in as a percent of revenue  gross margin decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal included in the results is a charge of approximately million related to an increase in the excess and obsolete inventory valuation reserves as a result of the refinement in the estimated reserve calculation 
the charge was recorded in cost of sales  and reflect a refinement in our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory resulting from industry trends toward shorter product lifecycles and other factors 
during  we recorded a charge related to excess and obsolete inventory of million related to raw materials purchased and finished goods manufactured to fulfill orders cancelled or delayed as customer demand unexpectedly decreased in the period 
the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue in compared to approximately million of the decrease in gross margin 
in addition  gross margin was negatively impacted by the exclusion of artesyn solutions from our consolidated results in approximately million and supplier cancellation charges incurred in approximately million 
these effects were somewhat offset by cost savings from our manufacturing locations  accounting for the balance of the change between periods 
gross profit as a percent of revenue reflected a decrease in compared to due primarily to the exclusion of the results from artesyn solutions  which was a higher margin business  and a lower proportion of revenue from our communications products segment 
we do not anticipate a material improvement in gross profit as a percent of revenue unless revenue increases over the levels recorded in  allowing for greater utilization of our manufacturing capacity  and until the full effect of our planned plant closures are realized 
during  we announced that we would be closing our kindberg  austria and youghal  ireland manufacturing facilities as part of our ongoing efforts to match our level of expenses with the reduced level of demand for our products 
these measures are explained in further detail in restructuring and related charges below 
in addition to these actions  we have closed several other manufacturing and engineering facilities worldwide 
all functions provided by these facilities have been consolidated into other facilities throughout the world 
the cost reduction initiatives implemented in both operating segments included factory work force reductions  shortened work weeks  asset disposals and restrictions on discretionary spending 
we are committed to aligning our cost structure with current customer demand 
to that end  if we determine it is necessary to make additional cost reductions during to enhance financial performance  we are prepared to do so 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  for fiscal year ended december  compared to million  or of sales  in  a decrease of million or when it was determined that our costs and infrastructure were in excess of requirements to support near term levels of customer demand  we took steps  which are discussed below in restructuring and related charges  to reduce infrastructure and personnel to maintain  in our judgment  the proper relationship between operating expenses and revenue 
these steps included  among other actions  the closing of engineering and administrative facilities and headcount reductions 
these cost saving initiatives are the primary reasons for the dollar reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to in addition to the effect of cost saving initiatives  approximately million of the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in is attributable to the exclusion of artesyn solutions after its sale 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses of million in compared to the effect of foreign currency translation can vary significantly over time 
we anticipate the effect will not be material in future periods 
excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates  the level of selling  general and administrative expenses in is expected to be below the level recorded in research and development expenses totaled million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in  a decrease of million or 
this reduction in research and development expenses reflects closure of engineering facilities  headcount reductions and other actions 
while we have reduced our research and development expenses to maintain an appropriate relationship with revenue  we maintain our commitment to invest in research and development activities 
we expect the level of research and development expenses in to be below  on an actual dollar basis  the level recorded in  due primarily to cost saving measures put in place during the previous year 
amortization impairment of goodwill 
on december   we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of sfas  goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization but is subject to an annual impairment test 
we have not recorded and will not record amortization expense related to goodwill in any period after adoption of sfas due to adverse business conditions in our end markets  operating performance did not meet initial expectations during in addition  our stock price had fallen dramatically in the same period  indicating that the implied value of the company had declined 
based on these trends  our earnings forecasts were revised and we performed an updated assessment of impairment of goodwill 
as a result  a goodwill impairment loss was recognized in the power conversion segment for million and the communications products segment for million during the third quarter of the total impairment charge of million is included in operating expenses in the impairment charge removed all the goodwill previously recorded in the power conversion segment and reduced the goodwill recorded in the communications products segment to million as of the end of the fair value of each reporting unit was determined by an independent third party using the present value of projected future cash flows 
we will continue to apply the standards dictated by sfas  and if market conditions continue to deteriorate  additional assessments may become necessary 
restructuring and related charges 
during and  we implemented plans to restructure certain operations 
this was necessitated by the significant reduction in actual and forecasted customer demand for our products  which resulted in excess manufacturing capacity and costs 
our restructuring activities are designed to address these issues  and are comprised of the following elements a realignment of our commercial functions along customer market lines in order to provide enhanced customer service 
addressing excess capacity and cost issues by closing several operating and administrative facilities throughout the world and consolidating their functions into other existing locations 
the elimination of a number of operational and administrative positions company wide 
pursuant to our restructuring plan  during  we recorded restructuring and related charges totaling approximately million 
this amount included employee and facility expenses related to the planned closure of our kindberg  austria and our youghal  ireland manufacturing facilities 
other headcount reductions  asset write offs and facility closure expenses are included in this charge 
the components of this charge  along with the activity related to these and other restructuring charges  are presented in the following table s activity charges to reserve accrued liability at december  restructuring charge cash non cash accrued liability at december  employee termination costs liability for payback of developmental grants facility closures the charge for facility closures is comprised of write offs of equipment and other fixed assets to be disposed of or abandoned and an estimate of the future lease commitments and buyout options for those locations being closed  after considering sublease and time to market expectations 
we anticipate the closure of facilities and disposal of assets will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of lease payments for the closed facilities  which total approximately million  extend into we will continue to aggressively market these locations in an attempt to secure sublease arrangements on favorable terms 
the restructuring plans included the termination and payment of related severance benefits for approximately  employees  direct labor  indirect labor and administrative  of which approximately  have been terminated as of december  the remaining terminations and associated termination payments will be made during the charges for payback of developmental grants relate to the planned headcount reduction at our ireland location 
we were granted developmental funds from the irish government provided a work force of approximately people was maintained 
the planned restructuring actions at the facility will result in a headcount significantly below the requirement 
as a result  it is expected that all or a portion of the developmental funds granted will need to be repaid 
as part of ongoing restructuring efforts  we expect to record total charges of approximately million in  primarily related to non exit costs that were not yet incurred when the reserve was recognized in  such as stay bonuses and equipment transportation expenses 
we are committed to maintaining a proper relationship between costs and customer demand 
to that end  we are prepared to take additional actions to reduce our cost structure during should business conditions dictate 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
we entered with lower outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit agreement compared with due to the sale of artesyn solutions 
in addition  our transaction with finestar early in see note of the consolidated financial statements further reduced the amounts outstanding on our revolver 
the reduction of outstanding debt on the revolver has resulted in a corresponding reduction in interest expense in compared to the reduction in interest expense attributable to lower outstanding borrowings  however  was somewhat offset by a write off of debt issuance costs recorded in association with the latest amendment to the revolving credit facility 
during december  we sold our repair and logistics business  artesyn solutions  inc to solectron global services  inc 
for million 
a substantial portion of the net proceeds was used to pay down outstanding debt  reducing our interest expense in related to our senior credit facility 
on january   we received a million investment from finestar international limited  an entity controlled by mr 
bruce cheng  founder and chairman of delta electronics  a leading global power supply  electronic component and video display manufacturer and one of our competitors 
the million investment was made through the issuance of a five year subordinated convertible note and a five year warrant to purchase million shares of our common stock 
a substantial portion of the cash received from the transaction with finestar was used to pay down our senior debt 
interest expense in future periods will include interest and accretion related to the instruments issued in connection with this transaction 
both parties have the right to redeem the note after january the reduction in interest expense in related to the reduction in outstanding borrowing was offset by additional interest expense related to the write off of debt issuance costs 
our latest bank amendment included a reduction in the capacity of the revolver from million to million 
as a result of this reduction  there was a partial write off of costs that were capitalized related to the previous bank amendment million 
as the capacity is reduced during see liquidity and capital resources additional write offs will occur 
the new agreement also contained an increase in the interest rate an additional basis points we are being charged for outstanding balances on the revolver  with a further interest rate increase to occur in june while the increased interest rate will result in higher interest expense compared to  the reduction in total borrowings should more than offset the additional increase 
benefit for income taxes 
in  a benefit for income taxes of of the pretax loss was recorded compared to a benefit of of the pretax loss recorded in the primary reasons for the difference between the periods was the non deductibility of the majority of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in along with the valuation allowance of million recorded in related to deferred tax assets in hungary 
net loss 
net loss in was million  or per diluted share  compared to net loss of million  or per diluted share in the primary reasons for the increased loss in were the goodwill impairment charge approximately million after tax recorded in the third quarter of  the gain on the sale of artesyn solutions approximately million after tax recorded in the fourth quarter of recorded in and the reduction in revenue as discussed above 
there was no amortization expense recognized in related to goodwill  which partially offset the negative factors discussed above 
power conversion during  both the enterprise computing and telecom and wireless markets serviced by our power conversion segment continued to erode 
the reduction in revenue was the single most important factor in the segment s performance in compared to revenue for the power conversion segment in was million  a decrease of million  or  from the operating loss recorded for our power conversion segment in was million  compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the primary reason for this difference was the million charge for goodwill impairment recorded in the remainder of the difference is primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue million and an increase in restructuring charges million offset by amortization of goodwill recorded in million and the effect of cost savings initiatives adopted in and communications products revenue from our communications products segment in was million compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in revenue is the result of the continued decrease in demand in the telecom and wireless market sector 
the operating loss recorded for our communications products segment in increased to million from the million operating loss recorded in  a difference of million or 
the primary difference between the operating loss recorded in in comparison to is the goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in along with the effect of lower revenue million offset by the amortization expense recorded in million and cost reductions adopted during the last twelve months 
results of operations compared to consolidated sales 
sales for the fiscal year ended december  were million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in sales is primarily the result of a significant and unexpected reduction in demand that we experienced from most of our major customers across our product lines 
gross margin 
gross margin decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percent of revenue  gross margin decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal included in the results is a charge of approximately million for increased excess and obsolete inventory reserve taken during the period outside of our normal adjustments 
the charges were recorded in cost of sales  reducing gross margin by that amount during the period 
during early  we had purchased raw materials and manufactured finished goods to fulfill orders canceled or delayed as customer demand unexpectedly decreased 
this resulted in a significant increase in inventory during the first half of the drop in demand resulted in the increase in the excess and obsolete inventory reserve 
in addition to the inventory charge  the decrease in gross margin is primarily the result of the decrease in revenue experienced in the period approximately million 
gross margin was negatively impacted to a lesser extent by manufacturing inefficiencies and mix and pricing issues 
manufacturing inefficiencies resulted from the decrease in demand  which lowered plant utilization  reducing the absorption of costs  and resulted in lower gross margins approximately million 
included in the mix and pricing issues was a decline in sales of several long running  high margin  custom products and the start up costs of new programs that began to ship during gross margins were also negatively impacted during throughout the company by raw material supply and pricing issues 
the component supply problems we experienced throughout fiscal year eased or were eliminated in the first half of  and many of our suppliers were able to fulfill orders placed in previous periods 
the commitments to purchase these components  however  had been locked in during at premium prices during a time of supply shortages and strong customer demand for our products  which resulted in our purchasing components at premium prices that we could not pass along to our customers 
during the second quarter of  we announced we would initiate company wide cost saving measures in order to match our level of expenses with the reduced level of demand for our products 
the result of these measures is the restructuring plan discussed in restructuring and related charges below 
as part of the restructuring plan  we closed our broomfield  colorado manufacturing facility  our huntington beach  california product renewal center  and several other manufacturing and engineering offices worldwide 
we also announced that we would close our oberhausen  germany manufacturing facility in the first quarter of all functions provided by these facilities were consolidated into other locations throughout the world 
the cost reduction initiatives implemented in both operating segments during included factory work force reduction  shortened work weeks and restrictions on discretionary spending 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million  or of sales  for the comparable prior year period 
in response to the significant decrease in customer demand experienced during  we implemented several cost savings plans to reflect our reduced level of customer demand 
our initial expectations for included revenue growth over comparable periods 
in order to administer anticipated growth  we increased our investment in infrastructure and personnel in late and early leading to higher operating expenses on an actual dollar basis 
when this growth did not materialize  we took steps to reduce infrastructure and personnel to maintain the proper relationship between operating expenses and revenue 
these steps included closure of engineering and administrative facilities and headcount reductions 
these cost savings initiatives are the primary reason for the dollar reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal in comparison to the applicable period in research and development expenses totaled million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal expenses were reduced due to the closure of engineering facilities  headcount reductions and other actions 
restructuring and related charges 
during  we implemented a plan to restructure certain of our operations as a result of the significant reduction in customer demand experienced during  which resulted in our having excess manufacturing capacity and costs 
the restructuring plan is designed to address these issues and is comprised of the following elements realignment of our commercial functions along customer market lines in order to provide our customers with enhanced service 
addressing certain excess capacity and cost issues by closing several operating and administrative facilities throughout the world and consolidating their functions into other existing locations 
the elimination of certain operational and administrative positions company wide 
pursuant to our restructuring plan  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million 
the remaining restructuring accrual on december  is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position 
the components of this charge  along with the activity  are presented in the following table s 
activity accrued liability at december  restructuring charge cash non cash accrued liability at december  facility closures employee termination costs the charge for facility closures primarily includes write downs equipment  property and other fixed assets to be disposed of or abandoned at locations that have been closed to estimated fair value considering the asset condition  current market factors and third party offers 
gain on sale of artesyn solutions 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold our repair and logistics business  artesyn solutions  to solectron global services  inc included as a reduction in operating expenses in fiscal is the pre tax gain on the sale of the subsidiary of million 
the net proceeds from the transaction were used to pay down long term debt 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization expense for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  over the comparable period 
the increase was the result of amortization expense related to goodwill from the acquisition of spider software  azcore technologies and real time digital 
operating income loss 
total operating loss for fiscal was million compared with operating income of million in fiscal the primary reasons for the decrease were the industry wide decrease in demand experienced in along with the other factors discussed in gross margin 
included in the operating loss in was the additional excess and obsolete inventory reserve of million and the restructuring charges of million  offset by the gain on sale of artesyn solutions of million 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income for fiscal  increased from million in the comparable period to million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of additional outstanding borrowings related to the use of operating cash flow to fund an increase in working capital in the first half of  borrowings related to the acquisition of spider software and available cash used for the acquisition of azcore technologies and real time digital 
in the first quarter of  we entered into a new credit agreement 
we were out of compliance with the covenant requirements contained in this credit agreement at the end of the third quarter of at that point  we obtained a waiver related to these covenants from our syndicate of banks and began the process of amending our credit agreement  taking into account the new business conditions we experienced in on january   we signed and executed an amendment to our credit agreement 
provision benefit for income taxes 
in fiscal  a benefit for income taxes of of the pretax loss was recorded compared to a tax provision of of pretax income recorded in fiscal year the change in our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the geographic distribution of losses in along with certain tax benefits that could not be utilized in certain countries in  resulting in the creation of valuation allowances in those locations 
net income loss 
the net loss for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the comparable period in fiscal the net loss resulted primarily from the significant reduction in customer demand we experienced in the first half of  and the inventory and restructuring charges recorded in fiscal as discussed above 
power conversion sales 
sales for our power conversion segment were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  a decrease of million or 
the power conversion segment was significantly affected by the decrease in revenue in across all of its markets 
operating income loss 
operating loss for our power conversion segment was million in fiscal compared to operating income of million in fiscal the difference in the two periods is primarily the result of the significant decrease in revenue experienced in approximately million  resulting in significantly fewer margin dollars to cover operating expenses 
the excess and obsolete inventory charges of approximately million and restructuring charges of approximately million also negatively impacted operating income in the power conversion segment 
to a lesser extent  manufacturing inefficiencies  volume and sales mix issues  and material pricing issues discussed above also contributed to the change in operating income loss from fiscal to fiscal communications products sales 
sales for our communications products segment for fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in revenue is the result of decreased demand from customers in all markets served by the communications products segment 
operating income loss 
operating loss for our communications products segment was million in fiscal compared to operating income of million in fiscal the difference in operating income in comparison to was primarily the result of the significant decrease in revenue experienced in approximately million  resulting in significantly fewer margin dollars to cover operating expenses 
to a lesser extent  restructuring charges  manufacturing inefficiencies and sales and volume mix issues discussed above also contributed to the change in operating income loss from fiscal year to fiscal year in the communications products segment 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and equivalents increased to million from million on december  this increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of a five year subordinated convertible note and warrant to finestar international limited  or finestar  in january and cash generated from operations of million  offset by payments of long term debt of million 
on january   we received an investment by finestar  an entity controlled by mr 
bruce cheng  founder and chairman of delta electronics  a leading global power supply  electronic component and video display manufacturer and one of our competitors 
the transaction  the net proceeds of which were approximately million  included the issuance of a five year subordinated convertible note  which carries a interest rate and an conversion price  and the issuance of a five year warrant to purchase an additional million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
approximately million of the net proceeds were used to pay down the balance on our senior revolving credit facility  with the remaining funds to be used for general corporate purposes 
both parties have the right to redeem the note after three years 
cash provided by operations was million for compared with million in cash from operations was positively impacted by a decrease in accounts receivable  which provided a source of cash of million in compared to a source of cash of million in the primary reasons for the continued decrease in the balance of accounts receivable were the decreased level of business activity in and improved collections performance 
also contributing to cash provided by operations was a decrease in our balance in inventory  resulting in a source of cash of million in in  the cash flow effect of the change in our inventory balance was a source of cash of million 
the primary reasons for the change in the balance of inventory were the decline in business activity in  improved inventory management and decreased lead times from customers 
also contributing to the increase in cash from operations was the effect of accounts payable and accrued liabilities  which was a source of cash of million in compared to a use of cash of million in the use of cash in reflects a reduction in accounts payable resulting from the decrease in inventory previously discussed 
the sources of cash from accounts receivable  accounts payable and inventory more than offset the operating losses in the period  after removing the non cash effect of the goodwill impairment  depreciation and additional inventory valuation reserves 
capital expenditures for fiscal year totaled million  primarily for the upgrade of existing manufacturing equipment 
all of these expenditures were financed from cash on hand 
capital expenditures in fiscal year were million  which included an expansion of our manufacturing facility in china and the completion of a new manufacturing facility in hungary 
we expect capital expenditures will increase from the amount recorded in and will focus on the maintenance and technology requirements necessary for efficient production of specific key products 
a deferred payment related to the acquisition of spider software ltd  or spider  was made in the second quarter of for approximately million 
this payment is related to the deferred portion of the purchase price and was not contingent upon spider s operating performance 
the final deferred payment of approximately million related to the acquisition of spider will be made on march  additionally  the second of spider s contingent earnings periods ended on march  based on spider s operating results  no contingent consideration was paid related to this earnings period 
the third and final earn out period will end on march  we originally forecasted a potential earn out payment for the third period of approximately million based on spider s anticipated results  although the actual amount is not subject to a cap 
given spider s performance in and current expectations for  however  we do not expect additional amounts will be paid related to spider s contingent consideration agreements 
for the earn out period ended march   an additional million in purchase price was recorded based on spider s operating results  million of which was paid in  with the remaining amount paid during the third quarter of azcore technologies  inc  or azcore  was acquired in august for approximately million of fixed cash payments and up to million in contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain milestones through fiscal years and through the end of  several of these milestones had been reached and approximately million in contingent consideration had been paid 
in the first quarter of  an additional million contingent payment was made 
during the third quarter of  we recorded an additional million in additional purchase price due to the probability that additional contingent payments would be earned 
of the amount accrued  million was paid in the fourth quarter of  and an additional payment of million was made in the first quarter of the remaining contingent consideration will be paid as milestones are met 
real time digital  inc  or rtd  was acquired in january for approximately million  net of cash acquired  of fixed cash payments and up to million in contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain milestones 
the initial earn out payment of million was made to the former owners of rtd in the fourth quarter of due to the current state of the industry  we do not anticipate the remaining contingencies will be met 
as a result  we do not believe that any additional amounts will be paid related to the acquisition of rtd 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold our repair and logistics business  artesyn solutions  inc  to solectron global services  inc  a subsidiary of solectron corporation  for approximately million 
a substantial portion of the net proceeds from the sale was used to reduce the outstanding balance on our senior revolving credit facility 
net cash used by financing activities was million in this amount includes the net proceeds from the transaction with finestar  offset by the amount of debt repaid from the proceeds of the transaction and throughout the year 
payments of million were made in to reduce the outstanding cash balance on our senior revolving credit facility to approximately million at the end of the year 
this included payments related to the amended bank agreement discussed below 
on january   we entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provided a three year  multi currency  million credit facility 
the revolving credit facility  which expires on march   replaced our previous million revolving credit facility 
as of september   we were not in compliance with the restrictive covenants contained in our revolving credit facility in effect at the time 
we obtained waivers through january  for the september and december financial covenant tests 
on january   we amended our credit facility and changed the restrictive covenants to account for changed business and economic conditions 
the amended credit facility contained restrictive covenants that  among other things  required a minimum level of cumulative ebitda  minimum liquidity provisions  and limit the purchase  transfer and distribution of certain assets 
we also granted a security interest in our domestic assets to the lenders in connection with the amendment and reduced the bank s commitment under the facility to million 
in december  in anticipation of the announcement of the closure of our facility in ireland and other restructuring items  the facility was amended again 
this amendment removed the cumulative ebitda from the covenant requirements in exchange for a reduction in the facility s capacity  from million to million 
in addition  the amendment dictates additional reductions in the borrowing capacity of the facility throughout on march   the capacity will be reduced to million 
the borrowing capacity will be further reduced to million on june   million on september  and million on december  in addition  the amendment contains a provision that will not allow borrowings in excess of million unless our trailing four quarter ebitda with adjustments for restructuring and other costs defined by the agreement exceeds million 
at december   trailing four quarter adjusted ebitda was below the million threshold  and we are thus restricted to million in outstanding borrowings 
we will update the trailing four quarter adjusted ebitda calculation quarterly to determine if borrowings can exceed million 
also related to the amendment  we made payments of million from our available cash to reduce the outstanding cash balance on the revolving credit facility to million at the end of the amendment maintains certain covenant restrictions on minimum liquidity provisions and is secured by our domestic assets 
capacity of million on the revolving credit facility was also being utilized by a letter of credit 
the terms of the amendment also increased the interest rate for borrowings and provides for an additional increase in the applicable interest rates as of the end of june based on current expectations and business conditions  we believe our cash and cash equivalents  available credit line  cash generated from operations and other financing activities are expected to be adequate to meet working capital requirements  capital expenditure requirements  debt and capital lease obligations  contingent payments related to acquisitions  plant closure expenses and operating lease commitments for the next twelve months 
we currently expect that these sources will also be adequate to fulfill our long term capital requirements  although changes in our capital structure are always being considered 
due to the terms of the latest amendment to the credit facility  we will be required to reduce the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility to million on december  our balance under the credit facility at the end of was million of borrowings plus an outstanding standby letter of credit in the amount of million  but we reported a cash balance of million and a working capital balance of million 
during the first quarter of  the amounts outstanding on the revolver were further reduced 
on march   the amounts outstanding on our current revolving credit agreement will come due 
we believe that cash on hand at that time will be adequate to cover the amounts due on the revolving credit facility 
in order to provide a long term source of liquidity  we are currently negotiating a new credit agreement  which will extend beyond the expiration of our current credit facility 
the agreement being negotiated would be an asset based facility with borrowing capacity based on the amount of qualifying domestic assets and is expected to contain more favorable interest rate terms 
subject to reaching a final resolution  the initial borrowing capacity would likely be less than under the existing credit facility 
in the event the new credit agreement is completed substantially on the terms presently anticipated  we would continue to expect that our available sources of cash flow would be adequate to cover our anticipated cash requirements 
there can be no guarantee that there will be a successful conclusion to our negotiations 
in the event we do replace our existing credit facility with an asset based facility  we will face certain risks associated with an asset based loan 
the amount available to borrow under an asset based facility such as the one currently under discussion will fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including the aggregate amount of assets owned by a borrower and eligible for inclusion in the borrowing base  the advance rate with respect to such assets  and reserves against availability set by the lender 
these factors may change significantly depending on future circumstances  and lenders typically reserve the right to change advance rates  eligibility criteria and reserve amounts 
accordingly  our availability under an asset based loan may be different than anticipated  which could impact our future liquidity and ability to meet capital requirements 
under the terms of the note issued to finestar  the holder has the right to require us to repurchase the note in its entirety at any time after january  if finestar requests that the note be repaid  we could face liquidity problems as a result 
we would  at that point  be forced to seek additional financing to fulfill the obligation 
if financing cannot be arranged  we would be forced to look to alternative sources to satisfy the amounts outstanding 
we cannot be certain that such financing would be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas no 
collectively sfas 
sfas requires us to recognize all derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not part of a hedging relationship must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  the effective portion of the hedge s change in fair value is either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset  liability or firm commitment through income or held in equity until the hedged item is recognized in income 
the ineffective portion of a hedge s change in fair value is immediately recognized in income 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative investments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
in addition  it addresses a limited number of issues causing implementation difficulties for numerous entities that apply sfas and amends the accounting and reporting standards of sfas for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
we adopted sfas  as amended  on december  changes in the fair value for the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as and meets all the required criteria for a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings as the underlying hedged item affects earnings 
amounts reclassified into earnings related to interest rate swap agreements are included in interest expense 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative is recognized in earnings within interest income or expense 
the adoption of sfas resulted in an increase in total assets of million and a million increase  net of tax  in shareholders equity 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
was not material 
during the fiscal year ended december   we recorded the subsequent change in fair value of the interest rate swap derivatives as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss totaling approximately million 
as of december   we maintained no derivative instruments  and no related amounts were recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at that time 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
business combinations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 business combinations and statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises 
all business combinations in the scope of sfas are to be accounted for under the purchase method 
sfas is effective june  the adoption of sfas did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb also issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination at acquisition 
sfas also addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
with the adoption of sfas  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
rather  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying or book value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  impairment loss for goodwill arising from the initial application of sfas is to be reported as resulting from a change in accounting principle 
we adopted sfas no 
in the first quarter of upon adoption of sfas no 
 we performed the required transitional impairment test using a two step approach based on reportable segments and reassessed any intangible assets  including goodwill  recorded in connection with its previous acquisitions 
we determined that no impairment existed at that time see note of the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and thus was adopted  as required  on december  the adoption of sfas has not  to date  had an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we will continue to assess the value of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas as indicated in the statement 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and nullifies the guidance of eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in restructuring  which recognized a liability for an exit cost at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas requires that the initial measurement of a liability be at fair value 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  with early adoption encouraged 
we adopted sfas effective december  and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   and for interim periods beginning after december  the annual disclosure requirements of sfas were adopted by the company on december  as of december   the company has two stock based compensation plans described more fully in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for its stock based compensation plans under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
conversion to the euro currency on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the legacy currencies of the participating european union members remained legal tender in the participating countries for the transition period from january  through january  beginning january   the participating countries issued new euro denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions 
since july   legacy currencies are no longer considered legal tender for any transactions  making conversion to the euro complete 
we have assessed and addressed the issues involved with the introduction of the euro 
issues we faced relating to the euro include converting information technology systems  reassessing currency risk  negotiating and amending licensing agreements and contracts  and processing tax and accounting records 
the introduction and use of the euro did not materially affect our foreign exchange and hedging activities or use of derivative instruments 
while we will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro s introduction over time  based on currently available information  we do not believe that the introduction of the euro currency has had a material adverse impact on the financial condition or overall trends in results of operations 
risk factors that may affect future results the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed below may include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of that involves risks and uncertainties 
we caution readers that a number of important factors  including those identified in this section as well as factors discussed in our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission  could affect our actual results and cause them to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
many forward looking statements included in this form k are made only as of the date hereof  based on information available as of the date hereof  and subject to applicable law to the contrary  we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
we have experienced and may continue to experience operating losses if customer demand for our products does not improve 
we have incurred significant operating losses in and due to a drop in the demand for our products 
we had net losses of million which includes non cash after tax write offs of million in goodwill impairment charges and million in additional after tax excess and obsolete inventory charges and million for fiscal years ended on december  and december   respectively 
because of these poor operating results  we implemented numerous cost saving measures including  but not limited to  factory work force reductions  shortened work weeks  restrictions on discretionary spending  consolidation of job functions  reduction of product offerings  facility closures and other similar measures 
however  even if our cost saving measures are successful  our future profitability is primarily dependent on our ability to successfully market and sell our products to our customers 
accordingly  if demand for our products does not improve  we may continue to experience operating losses 
our restructuring initiatives may not result in a successful return to profitability 
to address our operating losses and the significant decrease in the level of demand for our products  we implemented a restructuring plan that eliminated approximately of all positions throughout our company and consolidated various departments to more closely align our cost structure with end market demand  reduced the number of our leased and owned facilities from to to increase the efficiency of usage at the remaining facilities and  generally  to reduce our operating costs  and organized our commercial marketing structure to more closely align it with our customers needs 
given the state of the telecommunications industry in which many of our customers operate and the overall economy  there can be no assurances that our restructuring plan will be successful nor that our restructuring plan is sufficient or timely enough to return us to profitability 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the intended future cost reductions will offset the substantial one time costs incurred related to their implementation 
if our estimates of expected cost savings  associated costs  or future customer demand prove to be inaccurate  it could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
our future profitability depends on our ability to successfully market our products in a volatile industry characterized by rapidly changing technologies and customer demand 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  changing customer demands  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and  in some cases  short product life cycles 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment  as well as an accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop  introduce or manage the transition of new products 
the failure of or the delay in anticipating technological advances or developing and marketing product enhancements or new products could cause our products to become uncompetitive or obsolete thereby severely diminishing our ability to generate revenues from those products 
additionally  we assume risks related to the value of our inventory 
we anticipate that the price for our products and components of our products will decrease over time due to the rapidly changing technology of our industry 
as a result of these price reductions  we regularly assess the value of our inventory using lower of cost or market parameters 
if the difference in value between the cost of inventory and the value the marketplace assigns such inventory is significant  such a development would necessitate a revaluation of inventory under generally accepted accounting principles  which could result in a significant reduction to our earnings 
we rely on significant relationships with a small number of customers and the loss of any of those customers could reduce our revenue and operating results 
our largest customers accounted for of our sales for the fiscal year  with sales to hewlett packard  dell computer and sun microsystems accounting for approximately  and  respectively  of sales for the fiscal year 
decisions by a small number of our customers to defer their purchasing decisions or to purchase products elsewhere could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  if we were to experience an unanticipated catastrophic quality issue ie a product or design failure with one of our customers especially one of our three largest customers and our relationship with that customer was threatened  the competitive nature of our industry could allow that customer to terminate its relationship with us and move its business to one of our competitors 
although we are designed in to many long term customer programs enabling us to be included in our customers new products over a product lifecycle  our reliance on significant parts of our business depends primarily on the continued relationships with our existing customers 
if one or more of such relationships are terminated for any reason  or significantly reduced  it could significantly reduce our total sales  thereby greatly impacting our future operating results and profitability 
we currently have excess manufacturing capacity  and face increasing pressure from competitors using lower cost manufacturing alternatives 
our inability to lower manufacturing costs may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in response to and in anticipation of our growth in and  we made significant investments in manufacturing facilities  capital equipment and global systems  including expansion of our manufacturing facilities in china  a new manufacturing facility in hungary and our new  global information system 
the industry slowdowns experienced in and have compelled us to close several of our manufacturing  engineering and administrative facilities  resulting in the relocation of the production of a number of products 
we expect to continue to migrate production to our lower cost facilities which may result in production delays or quality issues during the transition 
problems associated with such transitions may result if delays of shipments to customers  cancellations of delayed shipments  diversion of management attention  increases in inventory levels  increases in quality issues  increases in warranty returns  and an inability to achieve anticipated manufacturing cost reductions  any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we face intense competition in our industry  which could impact our future profitability 
the industry in which we compete is highly competitive and characterized by increasing customer demands for product performance  shorter manufacturing cycles and lower prices 
these trends result in frequent introductions of new products with added capabilities and features and continuous improvements in the relative price performance of the products 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share  each of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
market consolidation could create companies that are larger and have greater resources than us 
our principal competitors include ascom  celestica  delta electronics  emerson electric  power one and tyco international 
if our competitors consolidate they would likely create entities with increased market share  customer bases  proprietary technology  marketing expertise and an expanded sales force 
such a development may adversely affect our ability to compete in such markets 
our broad strategies to cope with the competition include  but are not limited to  maintaining an appropriate level of investment in research and development and sustaining and expanding the relationships with our customers in the high growth sectors of our industry  however  no assurance can be given that such strategies will be effective in the event of market consolidation in our industry 
our future success could depend on the protection of our intellectual property  costs associated with enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our operating results 
we generally rely on patents  copyrights  and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products 
while we have been issued a number of patents and other patent applications are currently pending  there can be no assurance that any of the patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any rights granted under these patents will  in fact  provide us with competitive advantages 
in addition  there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications  or that claims on future patents will be broad enough to protect our technology 
also  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity of and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results 
we face  and might in the future face  intellectual property infringement claims that might be costly to resolve 
we have from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting that our products or technology infringe on the third party s patent or other intellectual property rights 
such claims have resulted in litigation in the past  and could result in litigation in the future 
if we do not prevail in any such litigation  our business may be adversely affected 
in addition  our industry is characterized by uncertain and conflicting intellectual property claims and vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have on occasion resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
we cannot assure you that intellectual property claims will not be made against us in the future or that we will not be prohibited from using our technologies subject to any such claims or that we will not be required to obtain licenses and make corresponding royalty payments 
in addition  the necessary management attention to  and legal costs associated with  litigation could have a significant adverse effect on operating results 
on february   vlt  inc and vicor corporation filed a suit against artesyn in the united states district court of massachusetts alleging that we have infringed and are infringing on us reissue patent no 
 entitled optimal resetting of the transformer s core in single ended forward converters 
vlt and vicor have alleged that they are  respectively  the owner and licensee of such patent and that we have manufactured  used or sold electronic power converters with reset circuits that fall within the claims of the patent 
the suit requests that we pay damages  including royalties  lost profits  interest  attorney s fees and increased damages under usc s we have challenged the validity of the patent and have denied the infringement claims 
the parties are currently engaged in expert discovery regarding the validity of the patent  and will continue to engage in expert discovery regarding infringement and damages issues throughout the trial on our invalidity defenses is scheduled to begin july  and  if the patent is not invalidated  december  for the beginning of trial on the remaining claims including vlt s claim of infringement and damages 
the patent applies to sales of products that allegedly included the technology in question from the middle of through early the plaintiff is requesting a royalty to be paid related to the sales in question 
the claims against us relating to the patent in dispute involve compensation for sales recorded prior to the expiration of the patent  which occurred in early february management believes no future sales related to this patent are at risk 
we continue to assert that the patent was not valid and that our technology included in the products sold did not infringe on the patent 
the process has not progressed to the point where any determination of the outcome can be reasonably estimated 
although we believe that we have a strong defense to the claims asserted by vlt and vicor  if we are found liable to pay all of the damages requested by vicor and vlt such a payment could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating result and financial condition 
our gross margin is subject to many changing factors 
our gross margin percentage is a function of the product mix sold in any period as well as unit volumes  heightened price competition  changes in channels of distribution  shortages in components due to timely supplies of parts from vendors  ability to obtain components at reasonable prices  availability and price of skilled labor  and factory over under utilization 
we compete in an industry in which our customers constantly expect price reductions due to technological advancements and manufacturing efficiencies 
as a result  we need to carefully manage the factors within our control  such as obtaining price reductions from our suppliers  in order to maintain an adequate gross margin 
if we are unable to manage such factors  our gross margin could be significantly reduced  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
shorter delivery lead times may result in more variability in revenues  may result in inventory write offs and customer order cancellations 
we have attempted to reduce our product manufacturing lead times and the backlog of orders 
to the extent that backlog is reduced during any particular period  it could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter to quarter sales and operating results 
the current industry trend is toward reducing the time between customer orders and product delivery dates 
this trend will lead to decreased backlog resulting from the shorter lead times and orders being placed and shipped within the same reporting period 
if manufacturing lead times are not reduced  our customers may cancel or not place orders because shorter lead times may be available from other manufacturers 
as of december   backlog was million 
if orders are cancelled for products that have already been manufactured or where components to produce such products have already been procured  a significant change in the evaluation of the amount of our inventory that is considered excess and obsolete could occur 
we currently maintain a reserve related to excess and obsolete inventory that is reevaluated on a periodic basis 
in instances in which we have had a significant amount of cancellations  the amount of excess and obsolete inventory  and the resulting write off  negatively impacted our operating results 
our future profitability may be adversely affected by a disruption in our supply chain 
as a result of the custom nature of most of our manufactured products  components used in the manufacture of these products are currently obtained from a limited number of suppliers 
therefore  a change in suppliers could cause a delay in manufacturing  additional manufacturing costs  and a possible loss of sales that could adversely affect our future operating results and financial position 
at different times during  for example  we experienced shortages of certain ferrite cores that we obtained from a single source 
for varying periods of time  suppliers were unable to fulfill previously agreed to orders for these components 
to mitigate this risk  we have instituted a preferred parts program whereby we now obtain most critical components from multiple sources 
we face certain risks inherent with international sales 
international sales have been  and are expected to continue to be  an important component of our total sales 
for fiscal years and  international sales represented and of our total sales  respectively 
international sales are subject to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable and potentially adverse tax consequences 
other risks of international sales include changes in economic conditions in the international markets in which the products are sold  political and economic instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  import export controls  and the burden and expense of complying with foreign laws 
in addition  sales to customers in developing nations may fluctuate to a greater extent than sales to customers in developed nations  as those markets are only beginning to adopt new technologies and establish purchasing practices 
if any of these risks were to materialize  our total number of sales would be reduced thereby negatively impacting our future profitability 
we face risks associated with the manufacture of our products in foreign locations 
we manufacture a significant number of our products in foreign locations 
approximately of our sales for the year ended on december  were from products manufactured in asia pacific  from products manufactured in europe and the remaining from domestic operations 
the supply and cost of these products can be adversely affected  among other reasons  by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  increased import duties  imposition of tariffs  imposition of import quotas  interruptions in sea or air transportation and political or economic changes 
from time to time  we explore opportunities to diversify the sourcing and or production of certain products to other low cost locations or with other third parties to reduce our dependence on production in any one location 
in addition  we have taken necessary measures  including insuring against certain risks 
in the event of confiscation  expropriation  nationalization  or governmental restrictions in the above mentioned locations  earnings could be adversely affected by such business disruption  resulting in delays and or increased costs in the production and delivery of products 
our future profitability may be adversely affected by a change in governmental regulation 
our operations are subject to laws  regulations  government policies and product certification requirements worldwide 
changes in such laws  regulations  policies or requirements could affect the demand for our products or result in the need to modify products  which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 
the volatility of the market price of our common stock could adversely affect our stockholders 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  relatively volatile 
during  the closing sales price of our stock price fell from a high of on january to a low of on october the stock price has continued at a significantly lower level than was experienced in and the market price for our common stock could continue to be at historically low levels and subject to wide fluctuations due to the following factors  among others actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or financial condition or those of our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of new and enhanced products or acquisitions of new businesses  market conditions or trends in our industry or the industries of our customers  developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights  introduction of technologies or product enhancements by others that reduce the need for our products  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  general economic and political conditions  unexpected departures of key personnel  changes in the market valuations of our competitors  the sale of a large amount of our common stock by our largest shareholders  preferred stock that we may issue could have other rights  including economic rights  senior to our common stock  so that the issuance of such preferred stock could adversely affect the market value of our common stock and could also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without any action by the common stockholders  and the other risk factors listed in this section 
if our stock price continues to be historically low  it could significantly hamper our ability to attract new investors and  as a result  could have a negative effect on our ability to raise capital resources if the need arises 
a lack of access to the capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition if the need for additional equity financing were to become an issue 
there are certain risks associated with the finestar investment 
the right to require early repayment of the convertible note issued in connection with the finestar investment could create a liquidity problem and or impede an acquisition of our company 
under the terms of the note issued in connection with the finestar investment  the holder has the right to require us to repurchase the note in its entirety or any portion thereof but not an amount less than  i at any time on or after january  for the amount of outstanding principal plus accrued but unpaid interest or ii in the event a change of control occurs for of the outstanding principal plus accrued but unpaid interest 
in the event of a change of control involving the purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of artesyn for cash  the note will automatically be redeemed for an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid interest plus the greater of a of the principal amount outstanding or b the fair market value of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the note 
the holder s right to require us to repurchase the note could cause us to face liquidity problems if the holder requests payment at a time when we do not have cash on hand or readily available funds sufficient to satisfy both our repayment obligation and meet the cash flow needs of our operations 
additionally  this feature of the note could deter a third party from acquiring or attempting to acquire us because of the immediate cash obligation and premium on principal that would be triggered 
finestar s right of first negotiation under the securities purchase agreement may impede competing offers for our company 
under the securities purchase agreement with finestar  finestar is entitled to a right of first negotiation 
in the event our management or our board of directors i receives a proposal oral or written or otherwise that contemplates a sale of control or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets on a consolidated basis or of our power supply business or ii determines to sell or more of our total voting power or all or substantially all of our assets on a consolidated basis or our power supply business subject to certain exceptions  then we must first notify finestar and afford finestar the opportunity to negotiate a transaction 
while the time periods for the first negotiation right is limited  and our board of directors  consistent with its fiduciary duties  may determine not to proceed with finestar and accept a superior proposal  the existence of such right and the requirement that we deal exclusively with finestar during the applicable periods  could materially hamper our ability to attract and or pursue other offers and opportunities 
failure to obtain shareholder or governmental approvals  if required  in connection with the issuance of our common stock upon conversion of the note and or exercise of the warrant would  in certain instances  cause a cash payment obligation 
two instances may arise in which we would need to seek either shareholder approval or governmental approval in connection with issuing common stock upon conversion of the note and or exercise of the warrant  and failure to obtain such approval  if required  would  in certain instances  trigger a cash payment obligation 
under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvement act of  as amended the hsr act  we are required to file a notification and report form together with related material with the federal trade commission and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice before issuing million or more of our voting securities 
additionally  nasdaq marketplace rule requires a nasdaq listed company to obtain shareholder consent before issuing more than of its common stock or voting power outstanding before the issuance at a price per share less than the greater of book or market value at the time of the transaction 
although not presently applicable  rule could be triggered due to the anti dilution protections of the note and the warrant if we were to issue a significant number of shares of common stock or a significant number of options  warrants or convertible securities at a price per share below the conversion price of the note and the exercise price of the warrant 
if either shareholder approval or approval under the hsr act is required but not obtained  we would be required  in certain instances  to purchase the number of affected shares at the then market price per share 
such a payment obligation could be significant depending on the number of affected shares and the market price per share  and if significant  could cause us to face liquidity problems 
a conversion of the note and the exercise of the warrant could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock 
conversion of the convertible note and exercise of the warrant and the subsequent sales of the underlying common stock may cause a downward trend in the trading price of the common stock if the interest to buy the common stock by investors at that time is weak 
additionally  any significant downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock caused by the conversion of the note or the exercise of the warrant and the subsequent sales of the common stock may encourage short sales by investors thereby causing further downward pressure on the trading price 
the provisions of our credit agreement could affect our ability to enter into certain transactions 
our credit agreement  dated as of january   as amended  with a syndicate of banks  may restrict our ability to enter into certain corporate transactions  unless we obtain the prior written consent of a majority of the required lenders 
although we believe that we will be able to obtain such consent  we cannot guarantee that the required lenders will  in all circumstances  provide consent for the specific purposes for which we intend  which may restrict our ability to enter into  or delay the consummation of  certain corporate transactions 
if we fail to comply with the financial covenants of our credit agreement it could result in liquidity problems for our company 
our credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants including a minimum liquidity requirement 
if we were to violate any of these restrictive covenants it could result in a cross default under the terms of the finestar note and or accelerate any outstanding obligations then due under the credit agreement 
although we are currently in compliance with the restrictive covenants contained in the credit agreement  our ability to remain in compliance depends  in part on  our ability to continue to cost effectively market and sell our products to our customers 
although we are undertaking all measures we feel are necessary to enable us to remain in compliance with these covenants  there can be no assurances customer demand and our profit margins will remain sufficient to meet any or all of these requirements 
if we violate any of these covenants  it could result in significant liquidity problems for us if alternate financing options are not available 
we are currently in a position  due to our current cash balance  to pay the facility if needed  although liquidity problems could result if the available cash balance was used in this manner 
we have significantly less borrowing capacity readily available to us now under our amended credit agreement 
the amount of borrowing capacity readily available to us has been reduced from the million available under the senior revolving credit agreement amended in january to approximately million under the amendment signed in december in addition  as part of the latest amendment  the capacity on the revolver will be reduced during on march   our capacity on the revolver will be reduced to million  to million on june   million on september   and million on december  additionally  we cannot increase our outstanding borrowings above million unless our four quarter trailing ebitda with adjustments for restructuring and other costs as defined by the agreement is greater than million 
at december   trailing four quarter adjusted ebitda was below the million threshold  and we are restricted to million in outstanding borrowings 
we will update the trailing four quarter adjusted ebitda calculation quarterly to determine if borrowings can exceed million 
although our cash balance is significant  if a significant cash requirement were to arise  we may not have the borrowing capacity under our credit facility necessary to fulfill our obligations 
in this situation  if we do not have enough funds available to us  we would need to arrange for additional sources of financing  which may or may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
these circumstances  if they were to occur  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  business and operating results 
we may need additional financing  which may not be available  and any equity financings may reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders 
our ultimate success may depend upon our ability to raise additional working capital by selling equity securities or obtaining debt financing until our operating results improve 
the sale of additional securities  if market conditions permit  would result in dilution to the holders of common stock 
if we need additional working capital from sources other than from operations  we would likely attempt to privately sell additional equity or debt securities  and given the present financial condition  there can be no assurances any such attempt would be successful 
presently  we believe that our current capital resources are sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next months 
we are in the process of negotiating a new asset based credit agreement to replace the current credit facility 
if consummated  we will face risks associated with a credit facility with fluctuating credit availability 
the amount of credit availability under an asset based loan is generally calculated as a percentage of qualifying assets such as accounts receivable and inventory minus such reserves against availability at the discretion of the lender depending on the circumstances the net amount of which is generally referred to as the borrowing base 
asset based lenders typically retain discretion to change the advance rate with respect to the assets in the borrowing base  eligibility criteria with respect to such assets and reserve amounts 
accordingly  availability under an asset based loan will fluctuate depending on the amount of assets owned by a borrower  whether such assets qualify for inclusion in the borrowing base  the advance rate with respect to such assets  and the amount of reserves set by the lender 
as a result  if we are successful in completing negotiations on a new asset based credit agreement  we will have a credit facility with fluctuating availability and will face associated risks 
those risks include the reduction of amounts of eligible assets due to market conditions  the application of eligibility criteria  or changes to eligibility criteria  as well as the reduction of advance rates and or the increase in reserve amounts  which may be imposed at the discretion of the lender 
these factors could have the result of reducing the amount we may borrow under the facility at a time when we have a need to borrow additional amounts or requiring repayments under the facility at a time when we do not have adequate cash flow to make such repayments or when such repayments may not be in the best interest of the company due to the economic climate and or financial condition of the company at that time 
we rely on certain key personnel and a loss of such personnel could adversely affect our business 
our future success depends  to a substantial degree  upon the continued service of joseph m 
o donnell  our president and chief executive officer  and richard j 
thompson  our vice president  chief financial officer and secretary  and other key members of our management team 
we currently have agreements that provide incentives for our management to continue working for us 
except for mr 
o donnell and mr 
thompson  we do not have employment agreements with any of our other senior officers 
although we are not aware that any key personnel are planning to retire or leave artesyn in the near future  the loss of the services of mr 
o donnell or mr 
thompson or of certain other members of our management team  or their inability to perform services on our behalf  could materially and adversely affect our operations 
while we believe that we have been successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel in all areas of our business recently  we cannot assure you that we can continue to attract  train and retain such personnel 
our failure in this regard could limit the rate at which we generate sales and develop new products 
our board of directors ability to issue preferred shares could deter a change in control that could be profitable to our shareholders 
pursuant to our certificate of incorporation  as amended  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  of which  have been designated as series a junior participating preferred stock in connection with our poison pill  and to establish the preferences and rights of any such shares of preferred stock issued 
the issuance of the preferred shares can have the effect of creating preferential dividends and or other rights and or delaying  making more difficult  or preventing a change of control of our company  even if a change of control is in the shareholders interest 
we have a poison pill that could deter a potentially profitable take over by a third party 
under a rights agreement  rights are issued along with each of our shares of common stock 
a holder of such rights can purchase from us  under specified conditions  a portion of a preferred share  or receive common stock of our company  or receive common stock of the entity acquiring us having a value equal to twice the exercise price of the right 
the exercise price of the right is 
this arrangement is often called a poison pill 
our poison pill may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company  even if a change of control is in the shareholders interest 
there are certain provisions of florida law that could limit acquisitions and changes of control 
the florida business corporation act  as amended  contains a section entitled control share acquisitions which  in certain circumstances  eliminates the voting rights of shares acquired in quantities so as to constitute control shares  as defined under florida law 
florida law may also restrict business combinations between our company and owners of our common stock unless approved by two thirds of the voting shares of disinterested shareholders or by a majority of our company s disinterested directors 
these provisions may also have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our company or of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of our company under circumstances that otherwise can provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies using a variety of derivative financial instruments 
in the past  we have managed our interest rate risk on variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swaps  pursuant to which we exchange our floating rate interest obligations for fixed rates 
the fixing of the interest rates offsets our exposure to the uncertainty of floating interest rates during the term of the debt 
we have significant assets and operations in europe and asia and  as a result  our financial performance could be affected by significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate potential adverse trends  our operating strategy takes into account changes in exchange rates over time 
accordingly  in the past  we have entered into various forward contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency revenues 
the principal currency hedged is the euro 
it is our policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet the objectives as stated above 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
gains or losses that result from changes in foreign currency rates are recorded at the time they are incurred 
these gains or losses have not been material in any recent periods
