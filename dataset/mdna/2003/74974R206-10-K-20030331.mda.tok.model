management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company rtw  inc rtw and its wholly owned insurance subsidiary  american compensation insurance company acic  provide disability management services to employers 
collectively  we  our and us refer to these entities in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have developed two proprietary management systems i the rtw solution  designed to lower employers workers compensation costs and return injured employees to work as soon as possible  and ii the id system  designed to identify those injured employees who are likely to become inappropriately dependent on the workers compensation system 
we currently provide workers compensation management services to employers insured through our insurance subsidiary and to self insured employers on a fee for service basis 
during  we operated primarily in minnesota  wisconsin  south dakota  colorado  michigan and indiana 
in the fourth quarter of  we closed our regional offices in missouri which served missouri  illinois and kansas and massachusetts which served massachusetts  connecticut  new hampshire  rhode island and maine 
we did earn premiums from these regional offices in collectively  these regional offices had remaining premiums in force totaling million at december  we completed running off this business in february on february   our am best financial rating was downgraded from a secure rating b to an unsecure rating b as a result of the decrease in statutory surplus in from million at december  to million at december  and our adverse development in and that resulted in statutory operating losses in those years 
certain insurance carriers that write umbrella policies will not provide coverage to an employer if a portion of the employer s underlying insurance policy  such as the workers compensation portion  is written by a carrier with an unsecure rating 
additionally  certain of our independent agents may be unwilling to sell our insurance as a result of the downgrade 
as a result  we believe that our b rating from am best will make it more difficult to provide our products to certain employers 
while we believe that the am best downgrade will result in decreasing premiums in force  the ultimate effect of this downgrade is unknown at this time

table of contents significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note summary of significant accounting policies to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies include those policies related to our accounting for i premiums earned  ii unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses  including reserves for incurred but not reported claims  iii policy acquisition costs  and iv investments 
these accounting policies are further discussed in detail within each section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
financial summary this financial summary presents our discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of rtw  inc this review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements at december  the following table provides an overview of our key operating results s  except per share amounts year ended december  gross premiums earned premiums earned total revenues claim and claim settlement expenses net income loss diluted net income loss per share rtw reported a decrease in gross premiums earned to million in from million in total revenues decreased significantly in to million from million in due to a decrease in premiums in force related primarily to our regional office closures 
we reported net income of million in compared to net losses of million and million in and  respectively 
we reported basic and diluted net income per share of in compared to basic and diluted net losses per share of and in and  respectively 
the primary factors affecting our operating results included the following our gross premiums earned decreased in from  due primarily to a decrease in average premiums in force to million for from million in  premiums earned decreased in from premiums earned in were reduced by premiums ceded under a lower layer excess of loss reinsurance agreement  effective for claims occurring on or after july   that was in runoff in premiums ceded in included million in premiums ceded under this lower layer excess of loss reinsurance agreement  compared to million ceded in no premiums were ceded under this agreement in additionally  premiums ceded were reduced by million resulting from a change in cost related to excess of loss reinsurance in minnesota  claim and claim settlement expenses decreased significantly to of premiums earned for from for see further discussion under claim and claim settlement expenses  in our report on form k a  we revised the accounting for our contract with st 
paul re spr  which was originally accounted for under reinsurance accounting standards using deposit accounting standards  and restated our financial statements 
we further terminated this contract with spr in december and were refunded million  resulting in a million gain recorded in december deposit accounting for this contract required us to record a margin expense at of premiums ceded to spr and interest income on the fund balance at an amount equal to the quarter end us treasury bill rate less basis points 
the deposit accounting change caused a decrease in premiums ceded and an increase in investment income  claim and claim settlement expenses  policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses from the amounts originally reported in as a result  the accounting for this contract increased net income by  in after reducing interest income and the gain on termination by the margin expense  and an increase in the net loss by million  and at december   we established a million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets resulting in a corresponding increase in income tax expense 
this valuation allowance decreased to million at december  the million decrease in the valuation allowance favorably affected our income tax expense in see further discussion under income taxes 
we expect premiums in force to increase slightly from levels in we also anticipate that we will 
table of contents continue to operate in an environment of premium rate increases in  however  these rate increases will be significantly lower than experienced in  and we will focus on achieving profitability in our remaining regional markets by i aggressively managing and closing claims  ii reviewing policy profitability at renewal and removing unprofitable accounts  and iii aggressively managing policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses 
in the following pages  we take a look at the  and operating results for items in our consolidated statement of operations and also explain key balance sheet accounts in greater detail 
results of operations total revenues our total revenues include premiums earned  investment income  net realized investment gains losses and other income 
the following table summarizes the components of our revenues and premiums in force s year ended december  gross premiums earned premiums ceded premiums earned investment income net realized investment gains losses realized investment gains realized investment losses net realized investment gains losses other income total revenues premiums in force by regional office at year end minnesota colorado missouri michigan massachusetts total premiums in force premiums in force and gross premiums earned premiums on workers compensation insurance policies are our largest source of revenue 
premiums earned are the gross premiums earned by us on in force workers compensation policies  net of the effects of ceded premiums under reinsurance agreements 
the premium we charge a policyholder is a function of its payroll  industry and prior workers compensation claims experience 
in underwriting a policy  we receive policyholder payroll estimates for the ensuing year 
we record premiums written on an installment basis matching our billing to the policyholder and earn premiums on a daily basis over the life of each insurance policy based on the payroll estimate 
we record the excess of premiums billed over premiums earned for each policy as unearned premiums on our balance sheet 
when a policy expires  we audit employer payrolls for the policy period and adjust the estimated payroll and the policyholder s premium to its actual value 
the result is a final audit adjustment recorded to premiums earned when the adjustment becomes known 
final audit premiums recognized during the period include billed final audit premiums plus or minus the change in estimate for premiums on unexpired and expired unaudited policies 
our premiums in force decreased to million at december  from million at december  due to decreases in premiums in force in all of our markets  but primarily the result of closing our missouri and massachusetts regional offices 
average premiums in force decreased to million in from million in and million in in order to improve profitability  we aggressively targeted policies that did not meet our underwriting profit margin standards for non renewal or re underwriting at increased rates at policy expiration in  and our average annual premium per policy increased to  in from  in and  in as a result of the focused aggressive re underwriting in and our gross premiums earned decreased to million in from million in this decrease resulted primarily from i the decrease in average premiums in force  and ii final audit premiums which 
table of contents decreased gross premiums earned by million in and increased gross premiums earned by million in gross premiums earned increased to million in from million in this increase resulted from i the increase in average premiums in force  offset by ii a decrease in final audit premiums that increased gross premiums earned by million in compared to million in in  and  we were able to increase premium rates on renewing policies an average of  and  respectively 
we have been able to increase premium rates in our markets due to the following many workers compensation insurers have withdrawn from the markets in which we write premiums as profitability diminished in the workers compensation insurance line  reinsurance rates for workers compensation insurers have increased due to i reductions in reinsurer s surplus as a result of the september  terrorist acts against the united states  ii recent unprofitability resulting from highly competitive reinsurance pricing  and iii settlements related to certain reinsurance treaties written in the late s 
these rate increases have resulted in increased costs for workers compensation insurers 
insurers  including rtw  have raised premium rates to offset these increases in reinsurance premiums  and a number of workers compensation insurers financial ratings have decreased due to reserve adjustments recorded in  and premiums ceded reinsurance agreements allow us to share certain risks with other insurance companies 
we purchase reinsurance to protect us from potential losses in excess of the level we are willing to accept 
we expect the companies to which we have ceded reinsurance to honor their obligations 
in the event that these companies are unable to honor their obligations to us  we will be required to pay these obligations ourselves 
we are not aware of any developments with respect to our reinsurers that would result in uncollectible reinsurance balances 
under our excess of loss reinsurance policies  we pay reinsurers to limit our per incident exposure and record this cost to premiums ceded as a reduction of gross premiums earned 
in minnesota  we are required to purchase excess of loss coverage for our minnesota policies from the minnesota workers compensation reinsurance association wcra 
in  we ceded minnesota claims in excess of  per occurrence to the wcra  in and  we ceded minnesota claims in excess of  and  respectively to the wcra 
the per occurrence coverage level increased to  in in our non minnesota states  we maintained excess of loss coverage with a per incident exposure of  since we purchased this non minnesota coverage from a single reinsurer 
in  the non minnesota excess of loss coverage no longer included statutory limit coverage and was capped at million per occurrence and further excluded claims resulting from acts of terrorism 
in  our non minnesota per incident excess of loss coverage increased to  continues to be capped at million per occurrence and further excludes claims resulting from acts of terrorism 
we further decreased our retention to  per incident in all our regions in by purchasing increased excess of loss reinsurance in order to further reduce volatility in our results 
this coverage was purchased from three reinsurers 
for claims occurring after june  through policy termination on december   and on a runoff basis into  we further limited our per incident exposure by purchasing excess of loss coverage for losses from  to the lesser of  or the wcra selected retention level in minnesota and from  to  in other states from a single reinsurer 
this agreement was finalized after its effective date and activity occurring from july  through september  was recorded on a retrospective basis resulting in the deferral of a gain totaling million at december  we amortized  of the deferred gain as a reduction of claim and claim settlement expenses in each of  and and  in resulting in an un amortized deferred gain of  at december  the deferred gain is being amortized into income using the effective interest rate inherent in the amounts paid to the reinsurer and the estimated timing and amounts of recoveries from the reinsurer 
activity occurring on or after october  is recorded prospectively 
this contract was terminated effective december   however the policy remained in effect in for policies in force at december  through expiration  not to exceed fifteen months after the effective termination date 
policies written or renewing after december  are not covered under this lower level excess of loss reinsurance policy 

table of contents the following table summarizes the components of premiums ceded s year ended december  premiums ceded  net excess of loss reinsurance premiums  to  excess of loss policy wcra and other non minnesota excess of loss policies premiums ceded premiums ceded to reinsurers decreased to million in from million in the decrease in premiums ceded  resulted primarily from i a million reduction in premiums ceded under our  to  excess of loss reinsurance policy  ii a million reduction in excess of loss premiums ceded resulting from a change in estimated reinsurance cost for minnesota excess of loss reinsurance  and iii a decrease in gross premiums earned offset by an increase in non minnesota excess of loss costs in premiums ceded to reinsurers decreased to million in from million in the decrease in premiums ceded resulted primarily from the run off of premiums ceded under our  to  policy 
outlook the outlook for premiums in force  gross premiums earned and premiums ceded include the following factors we expect that our b am best rating and the final runoff of in force premiums in our massachusetts and missouri regions will put downward pressure on premiums in force in premium rates are expected to be relatively flat on new and renewing policies as we filed our rates at the high end in each region in which we operate in  leaving little room to further increase rates in premium rate increases realized in will continue to favorably affect profitability on each account in as we earn more premium on those policies 
we expect to further improve our agency relationships in resulting in new business increases primarily in our minnesota and michigan regions 
overall  we expect premiums in force to increase only slightly  our gross premiums earned include million in premiums earned from our missouri and massachusetts regions that were in runoff in premiums earned in these regions are expected to be less than  in additionally  we expect our average premiums in force to decrease significantly in compared to overall  we expect gross premiums earned to decrease significantly in  and premiums ceded under excess of loss policies will increase significantly as a percent of gross premiums earned when compared to the results attained for this increase is the result of two factors i our cost for excess of loss reinsurance coverage in our non minnesota regions increased substantially for while our minnesota cost decreased only slightly  and ii we decreased our retention to  in all our regions in by purchasing increased excess of loss coverage in order to further reduce volatility in our results 
investment income and net realized investment gains losses our investment income includes earnings on our investment portfolio and interest on our deposit receivable 
our net realized investment gains losses  displayed separately on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations  include gains and losses from sales of securities 
through january  we invested entirely in us domiciled investment grade taxable and tax exempt fixed maturity investments 
in february  we repositioned our portfolio  sold our tax exempt securities  and purchased taxable securities to take advantage of our net operating loss carry forward generated in and to maximize the after tax yield of our investment portfolio 
we realized investment gains totaling million as a result of this repositioning 
in february  we sold certain securities within the portfolio and realized investment gains totaling million to increase statutory surplus 
in september  we sold our corporate securities to further reduce risk in our portfolio and realized net investment gains of  in the third quarter of further recognition of realized investment gains and losses will depend on sales of our investments  if any  to meet our short term cash requirements or as we replace securities to manage our portfolio returns 
we currently invest entirely in us domiciled investment grade taxable fixed maturity investments and classify our investments as available for sale 
we intend to hold our available for sale investments to maturity  but may sell them before maturity in response to tax planning considerations  changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risk and changes in funding sources or terms  or to address liquidity needs 
our primary investment objective is to maintain a 
table of contents diversified  high quality  fixed investment portfolio structured to maximize our after tax investment income without taking inappropriate credit risk 
for further discussion of investments  see the investments section of this management s discussion and analysis 
investment income decreased to million in from million in investment income decreased as our invested assets decreased to million at december  from million at december  and our investment yields decreased as we moved out of corporate securities in and reinvested in lower yielding securities due to changes in market interest rates and our desire to lower risk by buying higher rated government and mortgage backed securities 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest earned on our deposit receivable to  in from  in our invested assets decreased due to decreases in operating cash flow in and  resulting primarily from i reduced premiums in force and premiums written  ii timing differences between paying premiums ceded and recovering paid claim and claim settlement expenses  iii the receipt of premiums and the payment of claim and claim settlement expenses  and iv net cash provided by lower investment income 
investment yields decreased to for from for the investment yields realized in future periods will be affected by yields attained on new investments 
investment income increased to million in from million in investment income increased as a result of repositioning our portfolio entirely into taxable securities that earn a higher pre tax rate of return offset by a reduction in our invested assets to million at december  from million at december  and further includes interest on our deposit receivable totaling  for invested assets decreased due to decreased operating cash flow  resulting primarily from i the difference in timing between the receipt of premiums  the payment of premiums ceded under our reinsurance agreements  the payment of claim and claim settlement expenses and the recovery of paid claim and claim settlement expenses under our reinsurance programs  and ii net cash provided by investment income 
tax adjusted investment yields were in compared to in the investment yields realized in future periods will be affected by yields attained on new investments 
net realized investment gains were million in that resulted from sales of securities in february as well as repositioning out of corporate securities in september net realized investment gains were million in and resulted primarily from our portfolio repositioning out of taxable securities in february net realized investment losses were  in and included  for the write down of a security whose decrease in value was deemed other than temporary 
outlook barring significant changes in interest rates or operational cash flows  we expect that income from our investment portfolio for will be affected by the following the increase in our funds available for investment as a result of the million of cash received in december from terminating the st 
paul re contract  we earned  in interest on our deposit receivable in there will be no interest earned on the deposit in due to our terminating the st 
paul re contract  funds from our operating cash flows and investment cash flows historically provided growth in our investment portfolio  however  these net cash flows will decrease as we focused on closing claims from prior years  years in which premiums were higher and more claims were reported  paying to close those claims 
cash flows for are expected to be adversely affected by decreases in cash flows resulting from claim payments on claims from and prior years exceeding cash flows from our premiums as we reduce our premiums earned in  further recognition of realized investment gains and losses will depend on sales of our investments  if any  to meet our short term cash requirements or as we replace securities to manage our portfolio returns  and new and renegotiated reinsurance treaties may affect our future cash flow and future investment income 
other income we recorded and received a refund totaling million from the wcra in the wcra periodically reviews its surplus position and refunds excess surplus to its members 
this refund represents our share of the excess surplus of the wcra at december  no such refund was received in we do  however  expect that fee for service revenues will increase substantially in from the  realized in total expenses our expenses include claim and claim settlement expenses  policy acquisition costs  general and administrative expenses  interest expense and income taxes 

table of contents claim and claim settlement expenses claim expenses refer to medical and indemnity benefits that we paid or expect to pay to claimants for events that have occurred 
the costs of investigating  resolving and processing these claims are referred to as claim settlement expenses 
we record these expenses  net of amounts recoverable under reinsurance contracts  to claim and claim settlement expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
claim and claim settlement expenses are our largest expense and result in our largest liability 
we establish reserves that reflect our estimates of the total claim and claim settlement expenses we will ultimately have to pay under our workers compensation insurance policies 
these include claims that have been reported but not settled and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
for further discussion of reserve determination  see the unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and reinsurance recoverables section of this management s discussion and analysis 
we experienced a significant decrease in the estimated number of ultimate claims for compared to and the number of estimated ultimate claims by accident year decreased to approximately  in from  in and  in the net decrease correlates directly to i the decrease in premiums in force  and ii the re underwriting that we completed with respect to our in force policies in and the gross and net average estimated cost per claim totaled approximately  and  in compared to  and  in and  and  in  respectively 
the increases in gross and net average estimated cost per claim are primarily the result of increases in severity  ie  the average cost of a claim  caused mainly by inflationary pressures 
the trend of increasing severity is attributable to a combination of factors that include increasing medical costs and increasing indemnity payments reimbursements to injured workers for lost wages per claim 
we have also observed a decline in the number of claims being reported over the last several years 
the declining frequency of claims contributes to the increasing severity trend because the frequency decline has been concentrated in less expensive claims claims involving less time off from work and less severe injuries 
the number of claims reported but unpaid open claims and the approximate average gross and net reserves on these claims each period was  claims   average gross reserve   average net reserve  claims   average gross reserve   average net reserve  and claims   average gross reserve   average net reserve 
the average gross and net reserves per claim are less in than in and as the open claims include newly reported claims from the later half of  including many with much lower severity that have not had time to close  as well as new claims that are anticipated but not yet reported 
the remaining open claims from and are primarily claims with significant injury characteristics resulting in the increase in outstanding average gross and net reserves per claim 
claim and claim settlement expenses decreased significantly to million in from million in as a percent of premiums earned  claim and claim settlement expenses decreased to in from in these changes are due to the following gross premiums earned decreased significantly due to i decreased premiums in force  and ii final audit premium reductions totaling million in compared to an increase in premiums earned due to final audits of million in  resulting in corresponding decreases in claim and claim settlement expenses and a distorted percent of gross premiums earned  the results include an million decrease in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses compared to the results which include a million increase in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses decreased in due to the following i in march  the minnesota state legislature changed the way the commissioner will assess self insured employers and insurers for estimated liabilities and administrative expenses of the state s special compensation fund scf 
the assessment changed from being paid by the insurer on indemnity payment basis to an assessment charged on premium to the policyholder 
we decreased our recorded accrual to reflect this legislative change  ii the frequency of claims reported in for and prior years was less than anticipated when we determined our liability in  iii we overestimated the liability for our mandatory participation in state and national assigned risk pool operating results for states in which we operate in and reversed that excess in  and iv our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is difficult and volatile due to our relatively limited historical claim data and small claim population  we recorded estimates of ceded paid and unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses under our  to  excess of loss reinsurance agreement totaling million in resulting in a corresponding reduction in claim and claim settlement expenses 
no such benefit was recorded in  
table of contents we increased renewal premium rates an average of in and in compared to premium rates for the same periods in and  respectively  reversing a trend of continued rate declines during years prior to increases in premium rates have the effect of reducing the ratio of claim and claim settlement expenses to gross premiums earned as losses do not increase with premium rate increases  and claim costs continued to reflect increasing medical and indemnity costs in accident year as compared to accident year resulting from inflationary pressures 
claim and claim settlement expenses increased to million in from million in as a percent of premiums earned  claim and claim settlement expenses increased slightly to in from in these changes are due to the following the results include a million increase in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses compared to the results which include a million increase in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses increased in due to the following i we increased the estimated liability for second injury funds and our mandatory participation in state and national assigned risk pool operating results for states in which we operate  ii our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is difficult and volatile due to our relatively limited historical claim data and small claim population  and iii we increased the estimated liability for claims in our closed missouri and massachusetts regions  we recorded estimates of ceded paid and unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses under our  to  excess of loss reinsurance agreement totaling million in including  amortized from a deferred retrospective reinsurance gain resulting in a corresponding reduction in claim and claim settlement expenses 
these amounts compare to our results which include an estimate of ceded paid and unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses totaling million and  amortized from the deferred retrospective reinsurance gain  we increased renewal premium rates an average of in and in compared to premium rates for the same periods in and  respectively  reversing a trend of continued rate declines during years prior to increases in premium rates have the effect of reducing the ratio of claim and claim settlement expenses to gross premiums earned as losses do not increase with premium rate increases  and claim costs continued to increase in  and due to increasing medical and indemnity costs 
these increases were offset somewhat by the effects of provider agreements that we negotiated during outlook we expect that claim and claim settlement expenses will be affected by the following factors claim costs will continue to be affected by i increases in medical and indemnity costs resulting from inflationary changes  ii severity experienced in future periods in our policy holder base  iii changes resulting from increases in operating efficiency and effectiveness realized through enhancements to our internal processes and procedures  including changes to our proprietary computer systems  and iv legislative changes that affect benefits payable under workers compensation laws  increases in premium rates  if any in  will result in increasing premiums earned without a corresponding increase in claim and claim settlement expenses  ultimately decreasing claim and claim settlement expense as a percent of premiums earned 
changes in premium rates due to legislative changes in estimated loss costs  increased competition and improving customer loss experience may offset rate improvements  and continued application of our claims management technology and methods to all open claims 
the ultimate result of the above factors on claim and claim settlement expenses as a percent of premiums earned is unknown at this time 
policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs are costs directly related to writing an insurance policy and consist of commissions  state premium taxes  underwriting personnel costs and expenses  sales and marketing costs and other underwriting expenses less ceding commissions from our reinsurers 
ceding commissions are amounts that reinsurers pay to us for placing reinsurance with them 
under our to quota share reinsurance agreement  
table of contents the ceding commission is adjusted to the extent that actual claim and claim settlement expenses vary from levels specified in the agreements 
the following table summarizes policy acquisition costs s year ended december  commission expense premium tax expense other policy acquisition costs ceding commissions resulting from adjustments to claim and claim settlement estimates for our to accident years policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs decreased to million in from million in and million in as a percent of gross premiums earned  policy acquisition costs decreased to in compared to in and in the decrease in reflects the following gross premiums earned decreased significantly in compared to and resulting in corresponding decreases in policy acquisition costs  commission expense decreased to of gross premiums earned in from in and in the decreased commission percentages in and are the result of i a focus on reducing commissions paid on new business in our non minnesota regions  and ii increased renewal premiums on which we pay lower commission rates in all our states 
in  our renewal business  on which we pay lower commission rates  significantly outpaced our new business 
in all of our markets  we believe the commission rates we pay are marketplace competitive  premium tax expense decreased slightly to of gross premiums earned in from of gross premiums earned in and in  other policy acquisition costs decreased to of gross premiums earned in compared to in and in other policy acquisition costs reflect the benefit of the following i improvements in our underwriting organizational structure resulting in a million decrease in personnel costs  overhead costs and marketing costs  ii an  reduction in an estimated accrual for second injury funds compared to recording an adjustment for those funds in  and iii a general decrease related to the decrease in gross premiums earned  and we incurred ceding commission expense resulting from adjustments to claim and claim settlement expense estimates for to totaling  in and  in no such expense was recorded in outlook we expect that policy acquisition costs in will increase as a percent of gross premiums earned to levels consistent with and as we expect no second injury fund accrual reversals in general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses include personnel costs  office rent  certain state administrative charges based on premiums and other costs and expenses not specific to claim and claim settlement expenses or policy acquisition costs 
our general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in as a percent of gross premiums earned  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in and increased from in general and administrative expenses decreased in as follows i general and administrative expenses included costs related to operating our missouri and massachusetts offices in  no such expense was recorded in  ii we recorded million in margin expenses related to our st 
paul re contract offset by a million gain recorded on the termination of the contract in compared to million recorded in margin expenses in on the contract  iii we recorded million in restructuring charges related to closing our regional offices in missouri and massachusetts and closing satellite offices in brainerd  minnesota and overland park  kansas in  no such costs were recorded in  iv assessments by state insurance guarantee associations iga totaling  in compared to million in and  in  v we incurred one time business repositioning costs totaling  in  vi we recorded bonuses of  in compared to  in  and vi we expensed  in leasehold improvement write offs related to rebuilding our minnesota and home office leased space in 
table of contents after adjusting for these items  general and administrative expenses increased as a percent of gross premiums earned to in from in and in these increases reflect general and administrative expenses increased as a percent of premiums earned  after adjusting for restructuring charges  iga assessments and one time charges as we had less revenue relative to our fixed operating costs and expenses 
we aggressively managed personnel and other operating costs and expenses during to appropriately align operating expenses with revenues 
all expenses continue to be managed aggressively and reduced where appropriate  a reduction and renegotiation of our corporate and minnesota office space that resulted in a decrease in related office expenses beginning in october  and during the fourth quarter of  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges totaling million to general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
these charges included costs associated with our decision to close our missouri and massachusetts regional offices  as well as our brainerd  minnesota and overland park  kansas satellite offices 
we anticipated that employees in our regional offices  employees in our satellite offices and employees in our home office would be affected by these closures 
the restructuring charge amount included  of severance pay and benefits of which  was paid in and the remainder was paid in additionally  the restructuring charge included office and equipment lease costs totaling  of which  was paid in and an additional  was paid in  and furniture and equipment disposals and other costs totaling  of which  was disposed in and the remainder was disposed in the remaining accrual balance for severance pay and benefits  office and equipment lease costs and furniture and equipment disposals and other costs was  and million at december  and respectively 
outlook we expect that general and administrative expenses will be affected by the following we have historically managed personnel and other operating costs and expenses to keep operating expenses in line with revenues 
all expenses will continue to be aggressively managed and reduced where appropriate  we have no plans to open additional state offices in and expect to further reduce overhead costs in as a result of our office closures in and runoff in we will continually monitor reported claim counts for and re examine staffing needs as necessary  and we reduced and renegotiated lease costs for our corporate and minnesota office space and expect that related office expenses will decrease in interest expense we incurred interest charges on our term loan in  and the term loan accrues interest  payable quarterly 
we may elect to pay an adjusted libor or bank reference rate on the term loan 
we paid interest at rates ranging from to on the outstanding balance of our term loan in compared to to in interest expense decreased to  in from  in as a result of the decrease in interest rates  million in principal payments in and million in principal payments in we paid interest at rates ranging from to on the outstanding balance of our term loan in compared to to in interest expense decreased to  in from  in as a result of the change in interest rates and million in principal payments on the note in outlook interest expense is expected to decrease in as a result of the million in principal payments made in total interest expense is expected to decrease to approximately  in from  in as a result of principal reductions in the remaining principal is due in income taxes we incur federal income taxes on our combined service organization rtw operations and insurance acic operations 
we incur state income taxes on the results of our service organization s operations and incur premium taxes in lieu of state income taxes for substantially all of our insurance operations 
in certain instances  we may incur state income taxes on our insurance operations 
additionally  certain provisions of the internal revenue code adversely affect our taxable income by accelerating recognition and payment of income taxes 
adjustments to book income generating current tax liabilities include limitations on the deductibility of 
table of contents unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses  limitations on the deductibility of unearned premium reserves and limitations on deductions for bad debt reserves 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider recent operating results  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
at december   we established a million valuation allowance allowance against deferred tax assets resulting in a corresponding increase in income tax expense as a result of this analysis 
this allowance decreased by million to million at december  as a result of the income we earned in and federal tax refunds totaling million resulting from a change in federal tax law 
we expect any remaining deferred tax assets  net of the allowance  at december   to be realized as a result of the future income and the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences 
no allowance was provided against the deferred tax assets in under the first provision of the job creation and worker assistance act of  signed into law in march  we were allowed to carry back our net operating loss for five years  to  instead of two years under previous law 
we filed our tax return in september  and received a refund totaling approximately million as a result of this federal legislative change from carrying back our loss 
an additional  receivable was recorded that related to the carry back that resulted from revising our financial statements for income tax benefit for the year ended december  included the following i a million benefit from carrying back our loss five years under the tax law change  ii a million benefit resulting from reducing the allowance as we realized favorable claim reserve development in  and iii a further benefit as we offset current year earnings by losses carried forward from the income tax benefit for included the items recorded in the third quarter as well as a million benefit from reducing the allowance related to recognizing a million benefit from the scf 
after excluding the effects of the benefits from reducing the allowance  income tax expense was million for compared to an income tax benefit of million for as a percent of income before income taxes  the income tax expense before any benefit from reducing the allowance was of the income before income taxes in compared to and of the net loss before income taxes in and  respectively 
outlook income tax expense will vary based on i the income from operations we recognize for  and ii the changes in our analysis of the valuation allowance necessary during the ultimate change is unknown at this time 
investments our portfolio of fixed maturity securities at december  included only us government securities  mortgage backed securities  and asset backed securities 
our portfolio is managed by an independent investment manager to maximize our after tax investment income without taking inappropriate credit risk 
in september we sold our corporate securities to reduce risk in our portfolio resulting in a  gain 
in february  we sold select securities within the portfolio and realized an additional investment gain totaling million to increase our statutory surplus 
in february  we recognized gains totaling million as we repositioned our portfolio by selling our tax exempt securities and repurchased taxable fixed maturity investments to increase our after tax yield 
we conservatively manage our fixed maturity portfolio  investing only in investment grade bbb or better rating from standard and poor s securities of us domiciled issuers 
all securities in our portfolio were rated aaa at december  we do not invest in derivative securities 
operating cash flows consist of the deficit or excess of premiums collected over claim and claim settlement expenses paid reduced by payments for reinsurance premiums as well as other operating expenses paid 
investment cash flows consist of income on existing investments and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
prior to  we generated positive net cash flows from operations due  in part  to timing differences between the receipt of premiums and the payment of claim and claim settlement expenses 
these net cash flows decreased significantly in  and as we focused on closing old claims by paying earlier to close those claims 
combined with relatively flat premiums in force in  and and decreasing premiums since that time  our cash flows from differences in timing have decreased 
additionally  as we lowered our reinsurance retention levels to  in mid  we decreased our current period cash flows as a result of pre funding quarterly reinsurance premiums under that agreement 
reinsurance reimbursements from our  to  excess of loss reinsurance agreement offset similar payments to claimants for those years in our investment portfolio decreased million to million at december  from million at december   as a result of these factors 
the cash balance at december  included million received from st 
paul re from terminating the 
table of contents contract late in december we invested this cash in january we expect that cash will decrease in as we pay claims for and prior years  years in which we earned higher premiums and incurred a higher number of claims reported while premiums earned are expected to decrease 
we record investments on our balance sheet at fair value  with the corresponding appreciation or depreciation from amortized cost recorded in shareholders equity as other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
because value is based on the relationship between the portfolio s stated yields and prevailing market yields at any given time  interest rate fluctuations can have a swift and significant impact on the carrying value of these securities 
as a result of classifying our securities as available for sale  and thus carrying them at fair value  we expect to encounter adjustments in shareholders equity as market interest rates and other factors change 
in  we recorded a  write down of a security held in our portfolio as we deemed its decline in fair value to be other than temporary in nature 
this security was sold in january and the proceeds exceeded the adjusted cost basis resulting in a net realized gain of  prevailing market interest rates decreased since december   and when combined with the sale of select securities to realize gains to increase statutory surplus  resulted in a million unrealized gain on investments in compared to a million unrealized gain in unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and reinsurance recoverables at december   the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses totaled million and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses totaled million  resulting in net reserves totaling million 
the net reserve at december  totaled million and included the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses totaling million net of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses of million 
accounting for workers compensation insurance operations requires us to estimate the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses reserves and the related reinsurance recoverables  together  the net reserves at each balance sheet date 
our reserves represent the estimated total unpaid cost of claim and claim settlement expenses  which cover events that occurred in and prior years 
these reserves reflect our estimates of the total costs of claims that were reported  but not yet paid  and the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported ibnr 
for reported claims  we establish reserves on a case basis 
for ibnr claims  we calculate the difference between i projected ultimate claim and claim settlement expenses as determined using generally accepted actuarial standards  and ii case reserves and carry the difference as the ibnr reserve 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr claims  we estimate the ultimate net reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
the amount by which estimated net reserves  measured subsequently by reference to payments and additional estimates  differ from those originally reported for a period is known as development 
development is unfavorable or deficient when losses ultimately settle for more than the levels at which they were reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on open claims 
development is favorable redundant when losses ultimately settle for less than the amount reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reducing loss reserves on open claims 
favorable or unfavorable development of loss reserves is reflected in earnings in the year realized 
both internal and independent external actuaries review net reserves for adequacy on a periodic basis 
this review assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current events and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
when reviewing net reserves  actuaries analyze historical data and estimate the effect of various factors on estimated ultimate reserves including i trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation  ii estimates of trends in claims frequency and severity  iii our and industry historical loss experience  and iv legislative enactments  legal developments and changes in social and political attitudes 
variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events  including changes in claims handling procedures  economic inflation  legal trends and legislative changes 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the effect of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by many factors 
additionally  there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the loss and the time it is actually reported to the insurer 
due to our commencing operations in  we have limited historical data to estimate our reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and  accordingly  we supplement our experience with external industry data  as adjusted  to reflect anticipated differences between our results and the industry 
estimating the effect that inflation will have on the ultimate cost of claims is a major risk factor in our workers compensation reserve estimates 
future earnings will be affected by reserve development associated with any changes in our inflation assumptions 
estimates for the and accident years represent the majority of the uncertainty because these claims have the lowest proportionate amount of paid loss as of december  
table of contents our reserve estimates are most sensitive to changes in the assumption about inflation for the and accident years 
each one percent increase or decrease in the inflation rate for both of these accident years would increase or decrease our loss reserve estimates at december  and by approximately  and  respectively 
our independent actuary provides management with an opinion regarding the acceptable range for adequate statutory reserves based on generally accepted actuarial guidelines 
we record our net reserves by considering a range of estimates bounded by the high and low point of the range 
within that range  we record our best estimate 
we focus in our decision process on improving our financial strength ratings and expect to remain a market for workers compensation insurance in all market conditions 
in  we established recorded reserves in the upper half of the actuary s range 
the ultimate actual liability may be higher or lower than reserves established 
our reserves are primarily undiscounted  however  we discounted reserves for selected claims that have fixed and determinable future payments at rates ranging from to in and the discount rates in and are subject to change as market interest rates change 
we use the same rates for generally accepted accounting principles as we do for statutory accounting in determining our liability 
we also reduce the unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses for estimated amounts of subrogation 
we continually monitor loss development trends and data to establish adequate premium rates and reasonable loss reserve estimates 
loss reserves  which are based on estimates  are inherently uncertain and represent a significant risk to the business that we attempt to mitigate by continually improving and refining our workers compensation claims processing practices and by employing actuarial estimation methods 
after taking into account all relevant factors  we believe our reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses at december  are adequate to cover the ultimate net costs of claim and claim settlement expenses at that date 
the ultimate cost of claim and claim settlement expenses may differ materially from the established reserves  particularly when claims may not be settled for many years 
establishing appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience

the upper portion of the table shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded reserves as of the end of each succeeding year 
the lower portion of the table shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded net reserves  based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimate is either increased or decreased as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 
for example  for the calendar 
table of contents year valued as of december   we paid million of the currently estimated million of claim and claim settlement expenses that were incurred through the end of  thus  the difference  an estimated million of claim and claim settlement expenses incurred through  remained unpaid as of december  the initial reserves in excess of less than re estimated reserves rows represent the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years 
for example  the reserve developed a million net deficiency over the course of the succeeding years 
the net amount has been included in income and the changes have been recorded in the period identified 
the cumulative net deficiencies in and are the result of reserve development inherent in the uncertainty in establishing reserves and anticipated loss trends 
as discussed above  due to our relatively limited historical claim data and small claim population  our estimate of the liability for net reserves is difficult and volatile 
as discussed further below  the reserve redundancy in is the result of accrual reversals resulting from changes in methods of assessing second injury funds  lower frequency in claims reported from the estimate at december   and reductions in amounts expected to be incurred for our participation in mandatory state and national assigned risk pools 
in evaluating this information  it should be noted that each amount includes the total of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
for example  the amount of redundancy to losses settled in  but incurred in  will be included in the cumulative redundancy deficiency amounts in   and this table does not present accident or policy year development data  which certain readers may be more accustomed to analyzing 
conditions and trends that have affected development of the reserves in the past may not necessarily occur in the future

our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses decreased in due to the following i in march  the minnesota state legislature changed the way the commissioner will assess self insured employers and insurers for estimated liabilities and administrative expenses of the state s special compensation fund scf 
the assessment changed from being paid by the insurer on indemnity payment basis to an assessment charged on premium to the policyholder 
we decreased our recorded accrual to reflect this legislative change  ii the frequency of claims reported in for and prior years was less than anticipated when we determined our liability in  iii we overestimated the liability for our mandatory participation in state and national assigned risk pool operating results for states in which we operate in and reversed that excess in  and iv our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is difficult and volatile due to our relatively limited historical claim data and small claim population 
the results include a million increase in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses compared to the results which include a million increase in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses increased in due to the following i we increased the estimated liability for second injury funds and our mandatory participation in state and national assigned risk pool operating results for states in which we operate  ii our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is difficult and volatile due to our relatively limited 
table of contents historical claim data and small claim population  and iii we increased the estimated liability for claims in our closed missouri and massachusetts regions  liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of our operations 
capital resources represent those funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations 
our primary sources of cash from operations are premiums collected and investment income 
our investment portfolio is also a source of liquidity  through the sale of readily marketable fixed maturity investments 
our primary cash requirements consist of payments for i claim and claim settlement expenses  ii reinsurance  iii policy acquisition costs  iv general and administrative expenses  v capital expenditures  vi income taxes  and vii debt service or principal repayment on our term loan 
prior to  we generated positive net cash from operations due  in part  to timing differences between the receipt of premiums and the payment of claim and claim settlement expenses 
as we lowered our reinsurance retention levels to  beginning in mid through runoff in  we decreased our current period cash flows as a result of pre funding quarterly premiums under that agreement 
in  the reinsurance reimbursements from our  to  excess of loss reinsurance agreement offset similar payments to claimants for those years 
this trend will continue into cash decreased for the remainder of as i we paid claims for and prior years  years in which we earned higher premiums and incurred a higher number of claims reported while premiums in force and premiums earned decreased  and ii amounts paid under our st 
paul re contract resulted in net cash outflows for most of until contract termination in december in  we expect that cash and investments will decrease from levels at december  as we pay claims for and prior years  years in which we earned higher premiums and incurred a higher number of claims reported while premiums earned are expected to decrease 
available cash is invested in either short term cash and cash equivalents or longer term available for sale securities pending future payments for such expenses as medical and indemnity benefits and other operating expenses 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and a money market fund that invest primarily in short term government securities 
cash provided by operating activities for was million 
this is primarily a result of net income of million and a decrease in deposits receivable of million and depreciation and amortization expense of  offset by realized capital gains totaling million  and a decrease of million in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million due to million in proceeds from sales of securities offset by million in purchases of securities and  in purchases of fixed assets 
net cash used in financing activities was million due to principal payments on our note payable in our need for additional capital is primarily the result of regulations that require certain ratios of regulatory or statutory capital to premiums written in our insurance subsidiary as defined by state regulatory bodies and insurance rating agencies 
raising additional permanent capital  while difficult in the current environment in which we operate  would stabilize our ratio of premium to capital and provide a solid base for the future growth of our insurance subsidiary 
as an alternative to raising additional permanent capital  quota share reinsurance or other additional reinsurance on an interim basis would have the effect of reducing the ratio of premiums to capital and could be used to satisfy state regulatory requirements 
state insurance regulations limit distributions  including dividends  from our insurance subsidiary to us 
the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by acic to us in any year is equal to the greater of i of acic s statutory surplus as of the end of the previous fiscal year  or ii the statutory net gain from operations not including realized capital gains of acic in its most recent fiscal year 
based on this limitation  the maximum dividend that acic could pay to us in  without regulatory approval  is approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
acic has never paid a dividend to us and we intend to retain capital in the insurance subsidiary 
on september   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase  from time to time  up to  of rtw  inc common stock 
we repurchased  shares in for approximately   shares in for approximately  and  shares for approximately million through we repurchased these shares on the open market or through private transactions based upon market conditions and availability 
the repurchased shares will be used for employee stock option and purchase plans and other corporate purposes 

table of contents investments held as statutory deposits and pledged as collateral do not have an adverse effect on our liquidity 
we believe that cash flow generated by our operations and our cash and investment balances will be sufficient to fund continuing operations  principal and interest payments and capital expenditures for the next months 
interest rate risk our fixed maturity investments are subject to interest rate risk 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of these instruments 
also  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative instruments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
we regularly evaluate interest rate risk in order to evaluate the appropriateness of our investments 
an increase of basis points in prevailing interest rates would reduce the fair value of our interest rate sensitive instruments by approximately million 
the effect of interest rate risk on potential near term fair value was determined based on commonly used models 
the models project the impact of interest rate changes on factors such as duration  prepayments  put options and call options 
fair value was determined based on the net present value of cash flows or duration estimates  using a representative set of likely future interest rate scenarios 
naic risk based capital standards the national association of insurance commissioners naic has risk based capital standards to determine the capital requirements of a property and casualty insurance carrier based upon the risks inherent in its operations 
these standards require computing a risk based capital amount that is compared to a carrier s actual total adjusted capital 
the computation involves applying factors to various financial data to address four primary risks asset risk  insurance underwriting risk  credit risk and off balance sheet risk 
these standards provide for regulatory intervention when the percent of total adjusted capital to authorized control level risk based capital is below certain levels 
based upon the risk based capital standards  our percent of total adjusted capital is in excess of authorized control level risk based capital 
regulation our insurance subsidiary is subject to substantial regulation by governmental agencies in the states in which we operate  and will be subject to such regulation in any state in which we provide workers compensation products and services in the future 
state regulatory agencies have broad administrative power with respect to all aspects of our business  including premium rates  benefit levels  policy forms  dividend payments  capital adequacy and the amount and type of investments 
these regulations are primarily intended to protect covered employees and policyholders rather than the insurance company 
both the legislation covering insurance companies and the regulations adopted by state agencies are subject to change 
at december   our insurance subsidiary was licensed to do business in minnesota  south dakota  wisconsin  colorado  missouri  illinois  kansas  michigan  indiana  massachusetts  connecticut  rhode island  pennsylvania  tennessee  maryland  arkansas  iowa  florida  georgia  new jersey  north carolina  texas and oklahoma 
in march  the naic adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles the codification 
the codification is intended to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to state insurance departments and became effective january  statutory accounting principles  however  will continue to be established by individual state laws and permitted practices 
the state of minnesota required adoption of the codification for preparing statutory financial statements for financial periods occurring on or after january  adoption of the codification increased our statutory capital and surplus by approximately million on january  effect of recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no
