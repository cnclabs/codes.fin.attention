we do not assume  and specifically disclaim  any obligation to update any forward looking statement contained in this annual report 
general the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december   should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this annual report 
our fiscal year end is december unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to our fiscal year 
we were incorporated in and commenced operations in july for the five year period ended december   our operating revenue  before fuel surcharge  grew at a compounded annual rate  while net income increased at a compounded annual rate 
we generate revenue by providing transportation services to customers in the short to medium haul dry van market 
approximately of all truckload freight moves in the short to medium haul market 
we seek to operate primarily in high density  predictable traffic lanes in select geographic regions 
this strategy allows us to achieve a high level of equipment utilization  while maintaining strict cost controls and obtaining operating efficiencies 
we offer our customers a range of services  including multiple pick ups and deliveries  dedicated fleet and personnel  specialized driver training  and other services 
we seek to obtain freight rates commensurate with the services we offer 
we have also enhanced revenue by charging for tractor and trailer detention  loading and unloading  and providing other services 
by focusing our services in high density traffic lanes  we are able to minimize empty miles  increase equipment utilization  and offer customers a high level of service and consistent capacity 
an important element of our profit strategy is to increase equipment utilization  improve rates and reduce our empty miles 
we work continuously to improve our operations in these areas 
historically  the excess capacity in the transportation industry has limited our ability to improve rates 
over the past two years  the transportation industry has seen some reduction in capacity 
we hope that in  this change in capacity will provide us with better pricing power 
nevertheless  our ability to obtain higher rates may be restricted by the national level of economic activity  which has been somewhat sluggish and which could limit our ability to obtain better rates 
an important source of our revenue growth has been our ability to open new regional facilities in certain geographic areas and operate these facilities at a profit 
as part of our growth strategy  we also periodically evaluate acquisition opportunities and we will continue to consider acquisitions that meet our financial and operating criteria 
as the discussion below indicates  controlling our expenses is also an important element of assuring profitability 
we view any operating ratio  whether for the company or any division  in excess of as unacceptable performance 
in  we will begin to operate more tractors with engines that meet the october epa emission guidelines 
these tractors may result in slightly higher expenses due to engine design differences  but we believe that by continuing to focus on achieving and maintaining operating efficiencies  we should be able to manage these expenses 
fuel is also a significant element of our operating expense  and we continue to seek to obtain fuel surcharges  as fuel prices remain volatile 
the ability to obtain fuel surcharges will become increasingly important if unrest continues in venezuela or war breaks out in the middle east 
we have also experienced increases in the cost of insurance since we actively manage our safety and liability risk as a cost control measure 
to manage the increases we have experienced in property and casualty insurance premiums we have increased self retention risk and our emphasis on safety to help us manage that risk 
see business safety and risk management  above 
the sales of our transportation services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
shifts in the consumer products market and overall economy may have a significant impact on our business 
we operate in an economic and legal environment that involves many different risks 
these risks range from such unpredictable matters as the continued unrest and potential war with iraq to general economic conditions and to the pace of overall economic growth 
we have described below  a number of these risks 
we expect that we will continue to be subject to these risks and to other risks that we have not anticipated 
we will continue to rely upon our employees and upon our operating strategy to address these risks as best we can and we will continue to work towards delivering value to our shareholders 
see factors that may affect future results  below 
a discussion of the results of our operations for the periods to and to is set forth below 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management 
these policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report  and include revenue recognition  depreciation and amortization  reserves and estimates for claims  valuation of long lived assets and accounting for income taxes 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence and arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determined and collectibility is probable 
these conditions are met upon delivery 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is calculated by the straight line method over five to ten years with salvage values ranging from to 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets held for use for possible impairment losses by analyzing the operating performance and future cash flows for those assets 
if necessary  we would adjust the carrying value of the underlying assets if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value 
impairment could be impacted by our projection of future cash flows  the level of cash flows and salvage values or the methods of estimation used for determining fair values 
we have assessed reporting unit goodwill for impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with the guidance in sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation was the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit has exceeded its carrying amount and we have not been required to recognize an impairment loss 
reserves and estimates for claims is another of our critical accounting policies 
the primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  collision and comprehensive  worker s compensation  and employee medical expenses 
we maintain self insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self insured liabilities 
we also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self insurance amounts 
the claims reserves represent accruals for the estimated uninsured portion of pending claims including adverse development of known claims as well as incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
accounting for long lived assets involves the leasing of certain revenue equipment 
we have obligations outstanding related to equipment and debt 
as of december   we leased tractors under noncancelable operating leases 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  the rental expense for these leases is recorded as lease expense revenue equipment 
these operating leases are carried off balance sheet in accordance with sfas no 
the total obligation outstanding under these agreements as of december   was million  with million due in the next months 
long term debt and the outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit are recorded at the carrying amount which represents the amount due at maturity 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences as expected to be recovered or settled 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as certain tax credit carryovers will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary 
accordingly  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
we continually evaluate strategies that would allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets and currently believe we have the ability to enact strategies to fully realize our deferred tax assets should our earnings in future periods not support the full realization of the deferred tax assets 
estimates are involved in other aspects of our business 
for example  in establishing reserves and estimates for claims  we rely upon our own claims experience and the experience of our third party administrator in assessing the amounts to be accrued as claims are incurred and the reserves to be established for those claims 
we make similar types of estimates concerning the collectibility of our accounts receivable and the concentration of our credit exposure 
we account for stock based compensation  which is almost exclusively stock options  under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 

in addition  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas statement no 
 we disclosed in the footnotes to our financial statements the pro forma effects on our earnings and earnings per share of the issuance of our stock options 
we have historically spread our stock options widely over our employee group in order to align the interest of employees with those of the shareholders of the company and to reward employees as the company grows 
as of december   shares of our common stock subject to options granted to our employees was approximately of total issued and outstanding shares as of the same date 
we believe that our method of using stock options has not been abusive or unduly expensive or dilutive to shareholders 
for additional information concerning our stock option plan  see our proxy statement issued in connection with the may   annual meeting of shareholders

fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  increased  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  to for from in  due mainly to higher average fuel prices during compared to  along with the increase in the ratio of company vehicles to independent contractors  from in to in we believe that higher fuel prices may continue to adversely affect operating expenses throughout continued unrest or war in the middle east could have a significantly material adverse effect on fuel prices 
see factors that may affect future results  below 
we have entered into fuel hedging agreements as a means of managing the cost of our fuel 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations off balance sheet arrangements  and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity price risk  below 
the company maintains a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs

we elected to write off our investment for financial accounting purposes after terion announced that it would cease operating its on cab communications system 
in january   terion filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws 
the impact on earnings per diluted share was for the year ended december  this write off resulted in a reduction of net income  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  of for the fiscal year ended december  income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences in income for tax purposes

liquidity and capital resources the growth of our business has required a significant investment in new revenue equipment 
our primary source of liquidity has been funds provided by operations and our line of credit with our primary lenders 
during the fourth quarter of  we registered with the securities and exchange commission and sold  shares of our common stock through a secondary public offering  that resulted in net proceeds to us of  see our registration statements on form s filed with the sec on october  file no 
 and november  file no 

the proceeds we received from this offering were used for the repayment of indebtedness and for general corporate purposes 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment  net of trade ins  office equipment  land and leasehold improvements  totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect capital expenditures  net of trade ins  of approximately million for  that will be applied primarily to acquire new revenue equipment 
net cash used for financing activities was approximately million for net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change for the periods presented was the result of the proceeds from the sale of common stock discussed previously  which were used primarily to reduce outstanding debt 
we maintain a line of credit totaling million with our lenders and use this line to finance the acquisition of revenue equipment and other corporate purposes to the extent our need for capital is not provided by funds from operations or otherwise 
under the line of credit  we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants 
the rate of interest on borrowings against the line of credit varies depending upon the interest rate election made by us  based on either the london interbank offered rate libor plus an adjustment factor  or the prime rate 
at december   and february   we had million in borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
the line of credit expires in june in october  we entered into a million term loan with our primary lender that matures in september the interest rate is fixed at 
the note is unsecured and had an outstanding balance of million as of december   all of which is due in through our subsidiaries  we entered into operating lease agreements under which we lease revenue equipment 
the total remaining amount due under these agreements as of december   was million with effective annual interest rates from to  with million due in the next months 
as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents 
management believes we have adequate liquidity to meet our current needs 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  which may require us to incur debt or seek additional equity capital 
the availability of capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock  and several other factors over which we have limited control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements our liquidity has not depended on off balance sheet transactions 
our off balance sheet investments relate either to the truckload carrier business or provide us access to an asset an aircraft we use in our business 
in april  we acquired a interest in concentrek  inc concentrek  with the intent of acquiring an interest in a logistics business 
we have loaned million to concentrek to fund start up costs 
through a limited liability company  we have loaned  evidenced by a promissory note that is convertible into concentrek s class a preferred stock 
the additional million is evidenced by a promissory note  and kevin knight  gary knight  keith knight and randy knight  who collectively own of our issued and outstanding stock  and who are also investors in concentrek  along with other unrelated concentrek shareholders  have personally guaranteed repayment of this note 
both loans are secured by a lien on concentrek s assets 
these loans are on parity with respect to their security 
during  concentrek filed suit against the descartes systems group  inc  a canadian corporation descartes  seeking damages for breach of contract  in connection with an agreement to provide concentrek with certain logistics software 
on august   an arbitrator awarded concentrek million on its breach of contract claim against descartes 
by an award entered october   concentrek was awarded interest at the rate of per annum from november   through june  the arbitrator has since awarded concentrek  for attorney s fees and expenses 
concentrek has applied to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan to reduce the award to a judgment 
see our proxy statement other investments and transactions with affiliates  to be delivered to our shareholders in connection with the annual meeting of shareholders to be held may   for more information on concentrek 
in november  we acquired a interest in knight flight services  llc knight flight which purchased and operates a cessna citation xl jet aircraft 
the aircraft is leased to pinnacle air charter  llc  an unaffiliated entity  which leases the aircraft on behalf of knight flight 
the cost of the aircraft to knight flight was million 
we invested million in knight flight in order to assure access to charter air travel for the company s employees 
we have no further financial commitments to knight flight 
the remaining interest in knight flight is owned by randy  kevin  gary and keith knight 
we have a priority use right for the aircraft 
we believe that our interest in knight flight allows us to obtain any access to needed charter air services for company business at prices equal to or less than is available from unrelated charter companies 
knight flight also makes the aircraft available for charter to third parties through a licensed aircraft charter company 
see our proxy statement other investments and transactions with affiliates  to be delivered to our shareholders in connection with the annual meeting of shareholders to be held may   for more information on knight flight 
in august and september  we entered into two agreements to obtain price protection to reduce a portion of our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
under these agreements  we purchased  gallons of diesel fuel  per month  for a period of six months from october  through march  if during the months following march   the price of heating oil on the new york mercantile exchange ny mx ho falls below 
per gallon  we are obligated to pay  for a maximum of different months as selected by the contract holder during the month period beginning after march   the difference between 
per gallon and ny mx ho average price for the minimum volume commitment 
in july  we entered into a similar agreement 
under this agreement  we were obligated to purchase  gallons of diesel fuel  per month  for a period of six months beginning september  through february  if during the month period commencing january through december  the price index discussed above falls below 
per gallon  we are obligated to pay the difference between 
and the stated index 
management estimates that any potential future payment under any of these agreements would be less than the amount of our savings for reduced fuel costs 
for example  management estimates that a further reduction of in the ny mx ho average price would result in a net savings  after making a payment on this agreement  to our total fuel expenses of approximately million

purchase obligations for revenue equipment includes purchase commitments for additional tractors and trailers with an estimated purchase price  net of estimated trade in values  of approximately million for delivery throughout seasonality in the transportation industry  results of operations frequently show a seasonal pattern 
seasonal variations may result from weather or from customer s reduced shipments after the busy winter holiday season 
to date  our revenue has not shown any significant seasonal pattern 
because we have significant operations in arizona  california and the western united states  winter weather generally has not adversely affected our business 
expansion of our operations in the midwest  rocky mountain area  east coast  and the southeast could expose us to greater operating variances due to seasonal weather in these regions 
recent shortages of energy and related issues in california  and elsewhere in the western united states  could result in an adverse effect on our operations and demand for our services if these shortages continue or increase 
this risk may also exist in other regions in which we operate  depending upon availability of energy

fuel prices  insurance and claims costs  liability claims  interest rates  the availability of qualified drivers  fluctuations in the resale value of revenue equipment  economic and customer business cycles and shipping demands are economic factors over which we have little or no control 
significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates  insurance costs or liability claims  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates  and the resale value of revenue equipment could reduce our profitability 
weakness in the general economy  including a weakness in consumer demand for goods and services  could adversely affect our customers and our growth and revenues  if customers reduce their demand for transportation services 
weakness in customer demand for our services or in the general rate environment may also restrain our ability to increase rates or obtain fuel surcharges 
it is also not possible to predict the medium or long term effects of the september   terrorist attacks and subsequent events on the economy or on customer confidence in the united states  or the impact  if any  on our future results of operations 
the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our growth outlook 
our growth may not continue at historic rates we have experienced significant and rapid growth in revenue and profits since the inception of our business in there can be no assurance that our business will continue to grow in a similar fashion in the future or that we can effectively adapt our management  administrative  and operational systems to respond to any future growth 
further  there can be no assurance that our operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic conditions 
ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels  which could reduce our earnings 
during  we were self insured for personal injury and property damage liability  cargo liability  collision and comprehensive up to a maximum limit of million per occurrence 
we were self insured for worker s compensation up to a maximum limit of  per occurrence 
subsequent to december   we increased the self insurance retention levels for personal injury and property damage liability  cargo liability  collision  comprehensive and worker s compensation to million per occurrence 
our maximum self retention for a separate worker s compensation claim remains  per occurrence 
also  our insurance policies now provide for excess personal injury and property damage liability up to a total of million per occurrence  compared to million per occurrence for  and cargo liability  collision  comprehensive and worker s compensation coverage up to a total of million per occurrence 
our personal injury and property damage policies also include coverage for punitive damages 
if the number of claims for which we are self insured increases  our operating results could be adversely affected 
after several years of aggressive pricing  insurance carriers have raised premiums which have increased our insurance and claims expense 
the terrorist attacks of september   in the united states  and conditions in the insurance market have resulted in additional increases in our insurance expenses 
if these expenses continue to increase  or if the severity or number of claims increase or exceed our self retention limits  and if we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates  our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
increased prices for new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment may materially and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
our growth has been made possible through the addition of new revenue equipment 
difficulty in financing or obtaining new revenue equipment for example  delivery delays from manufacturers or the unavailability of independent contractors could restrict future growth 
in the past  we have acquired new tractors and trailers at favorable prices  including agreements with the manufacturers to repurchase the tractors at agreed prices 
current developments in the secondary tractor resale market have resulted in a large supply of used tractors on the market 
this has depressed the market value of used equipment to levels below the prices at which the manufacturers have agreed to repurchase the equipment 
accordingly  some manufacturers may refuse or be financially unable to keep their commitments to repurchase equipment according to their repurchase agreement 
some tractor manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices  in part to meet new engine design requirements imposed  effective october   by the epa and eliminate or sharply reduce the price of repurchase commitments 
our business plan and current contract take into account new equipment price increases due to new engine design requirements imposed effective october   by the epa 
the cost of operating new engines is expected to be somewhat higher than the cost of operating older engines 
if new equipment prices were to increase  or the price of repurchase commitments were to decrease or fail to be honored by the manufacturer  we may be required to increase our depreciation and financing costs  write down the value of used equipment  and or retain some of our equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses 
if our resulting cost of revenue equipment were to increase and or the prices of used revenue equipment were to decline  our operating costs could increase  which could materially and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow  if we are unable to obtain commensurate rate increases or cost savings 
fuel prices may increase significantly  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are also subject to risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside our control 
the political events in the middle east  venezuela and elsewhere may also cause the price of fuel to increase 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of our short term fuel price increases from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always offset the increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
if the growth in our regional operations throughout the united states slows or stagnates  or if we are unable to commit sufficient resources to our regional operations  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
currently  a significant portion of our business is concentrated in the arizona and california markets 
a general economic decline or a natural disaster in either of these markets could have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability 
if we do not continue to be successful in deriving a more significant portion of our revenues from markets in the midwest  south central  southeastern and southern regions  and on the east coast  our growth and profitability could be materially adversely affected by general economic declines or natural disasters in those markets 
in addition to the regional facility in phoenix  arizona  we have established regional operations in katy  texas  indianapolis  indiana  charlotte  north carolina  gulfport  mississippi  salt lake city  utah  kansas city  kansas  portland  oregon  and memphis  tennessee  in order to serve markets in these regions 
these regional operations require the commitment of additional revenue equipment and personnel  as well as management resources  for future development 
should the growth in our regional operations throughout the united states slow or stagnate  the results of our operations could be adversely affected 
we may encounter operating conditions in these new markets that differ substantially from those previously experienced in our western united states markets 
there can be no assurance that our regional operating strategy  can be duplicated successfully in throughout the united states or that it will not take longer than expected or require a more substantial financial commitment than anticipated 
difficulty in driver and independent contractor retention may have a materially adverse affect on our business 
although our independent contractors are responsible for paying for their own equipment  fuel  and other operating costs  significant increases in these costs could cause them to seek higher compensation from us or seek other contractual opportunities 
difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors  or a downturn in customer business cycles or shipping demands  could also have a materially adverse effect on our growth and profitability 
if a shortage of drivers should occur in the future  or if we were unable to continue to attract and contract with independent contractors  we could be required to adjust our driver compensation package  which could adversely affect our profitability if not offset by a corresponding increase in rates 
we have experienced the effects of fuel and driver wage increases and are seeking to recover such charges through rate increases and a fuel surcharge 
by increasing rates and imposing a fuel surcharge  we could lose customers who are unwilling to pay these increases 
we are highly dependent on a few major customers  the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from a few major customers 
for the year ended december   our top customers  based on revenue  accounted for approximately of our revenue  our top customers  approximately of our revenue  and our top customers  approximately of our revenue 
generally  we do not have long term contractual relationships with our major customers  and we cannot assure you that our customer relationships will continue as presently in effect 
a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
terion trailer tracking technology may not be available to us  which could require us to incur the cost of replacement technology  adversely affect our trailer utilization and our ability to assess detention charges 
we utilize terion s trailer tracking technology to assist with monitoring the majority of our trailers 
terion has emerged from a chapter bankruptcy and a plan of reorganization has been approved by the bankruptcy court 
if terion ceases operations or abandons that trailer tracking technology  we would be required to incur the cost of replacing that technology or could be forced to operate without this technology  which could adversely affect our trailer utilization and our ability to assess detention charges 
our investment in concentrek may not be successful and we may be forced to write off part or all of our investment 
we have also invested and or loaned a total of approximately million to concentrek  inc  concentrek a transportation logistics company on a secured basis 
we own approximately of concentrek  and the remainder is owned by members of the knight family and concentrek s management 
if concentrek s financial position does not continue to improve  and if it is unable to raise additional capital  we could be forced to write down all or part of that investment 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations off balance sheet arrangements  above 
our stock price is volatile  which could cause our shareholders to lose a significant portion of their investment 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to certain factors  such as variations in our anticipated or actual results of operations or other companies in the transportation industry  changes in conditions affecting the economy generally  including incidents of terrorism  analyst reports  general trends in the industry  sales of common stock by insiders  as well as other factors unrelated to our operating results 
volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares 
we may not be successful in our acquisition strategy  which could limit our growth prospects 
we may grow by acquiring other trucking companies or trucking assets 
acquisitions could involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities and or our incurring of additional debt 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the acquired company s operations  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  the risks of entering into markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience  and the potential loss of customers  key employees and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we were to make acquisitions in the future  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired companies or assets into our business 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials  underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of stormwater 
we operate in industrial areas  where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located  and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage  and hazardous waste disposal  among others 
two of our terminal facilities are located adjacent to environmental superfund sites 
although we have not been named as a potentially responsible party in either case  we are potentially exposed to claims that we may have contributed to environmental contamination in the areas in which we operate 
we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances  or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 
the us dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business  generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  rates and charges  operations  safety  and financial reporting 
we may also become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  drivers hours in service  and ergonomics 
compliance with such regulations could substantially impair equipment productivity and increase our operating expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rate on debt and from changes in commodity prices 
under financial accounting reporting release number  we are required to disclose information concerning market risk with respect to foreign exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we have elected to make such disclosures  to the extent applicable  using a sensitivity analysis approach  based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
except as described below  we have not had occasion to use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and do not use them for either speculation or tracking 
because our operations are confined to the united states  we are not subject to foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent the company borrows against its line of credit or incurs debt in the acquisition of revenue equipment 
we attempt to manage our interest rate risk by managing the amount of debt we carry 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with our primary lender to protect us against interest rate risk 
in the opinion of management  an increase in short term interest rates could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition if our debt levels increase and if the interest rate increases are not offset by freight rate increases or other items 
management does not foresee or expect in the near future any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how that exposure is managed by us 
we have not issued corporate debt instruments 
commodity price risk we are also subject to commodity price risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political  economic and market factors that are generally outside our control 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of our short term fuel price increases from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always offset the increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
for the fiscal year ended december   fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  represented of our total operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  compared to for the same period ending in in august and september  we entered into two agreements to obtain price protection to reduce a portion of our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
under these agreements  we purchased  gallons of diesel fuel  per month  for a period of six months from october  through march  if during the months following march   the price of heating oil on the new york mercantile exchange ny mx ho falls below 
per gallon  we are obligated to pay  for a maximum of different months as selected by the contract holder during the month period beginning after march   the difference between 
per gallon and ny mx ho average price for the minimum volume commitment 
in july  we entered into a similar agreement 
under this agreement  we were obligated to purchase  gallons of diesel fuel  per month  for a period of six months beginning september  through february  if during the month period commencing january through december  the price index discussed above falls below 
per gallon  we are obligated to pay the difference between 
and the stated index 
management estimates that any potential future payment under any of these agreements would be less than the amount of our savings for reduced fuel costs 
for example  management estimates that a further reduction of in the ny mx ho average price would result in a net savings  after making a payment on this agreement  to our total fuel expenses of approximately million 
future increases in the ny mx ho average price would result in our not having to make payments under these agreements 
management s current valuation of the fuel purchase agreements indicates there was no material impact upon adoption of sfas no 
on our results of operations and financial position and we have valued these items at fair value by recording accrued liabilities for these in the accompanying december   financial statements
