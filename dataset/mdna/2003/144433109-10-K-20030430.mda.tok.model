item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under business forward looking statements and risk factors  elsewhere in this report or in the information incorporated by reference in this report 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data included in this report  as well as our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
our fiscal year ends on january references contained in this report to a given fiscal year refer to the twelve month period ended january of the succeeding year 
for example  our fiscal year ended january  is referred to in this report as fiscal overview we provide payments related software and consulting solutions to financial institutions and financial service providers 
these solutions help our customers improve operational efficiency in how payments are processed  enhance revenue and profitability from payments oriented products and services  reduce losses associated with fraudulent payment transactions  and evolve toward next generation payment practices and technologies 
we are organized into three primary operating divisions global payments technologies gpt  revenue enhancement reve and global payments consulting gpc 
these divisions represent our three reportable business segments 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we derive our revenues from consulting fees  software license fees  software maintenance fees  and software implementation fees 
while many customer contracts provide for both the performance of consulting services and the license of related software  some customer contracts require only the performance of consulting services or only a software license and  at the election of the customer  related implementation services and or annual software maintenance services 
we enter into these contracts with our customers on a project by project basis 
we seek to establish long term relationships with our customers that will lead to on going projects utilizing our solutions 
we are typically retained to perform one or more discrete projects for a customer  and we use these opportunities to extend our solutions into additional areas of the customer s operations 
to this end  a significant portion of our current revenues is derived from customers who were customers in prior years  and we are therefore dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our existing relationships with these customers 
recent developments we have restated our financial statements as of the years ended january    and and for each of the quarters in the year ended january  and the first two quarters of the year ended january  on december   we announced that a special committee of the board of directors had initiated a review of our financial statements  principally focused on the timing of recognition of revenue in prior periods 
the special committee was formed after several members of the board of directors became aware of questions regarding our accounting and disclosures 
the special committee  which was comprised solely of independent board members  was assisted in its investigation by independent counsel and forensic accounting advisors 
during the investigation  we became aware that  in certain instances  revenue had been recorded on contracts in one accounting period where customer signature and delivery of software had been completed  but where the contract may not have been fully executed by us in that accounting period 
we determined that revisions to certain prior financial statements were necessary to ensure that all agreements for which we recognized revenue in an accounting period were executed by both parties no later than the end of the accounting period in which the revenue was being recognized 
upon the completion of the special committee s investigation  our review was expanded to include a reassessment of our historical application of revenue recognition policies 
we had originally concluded that under the criteria of sop services were not essential to the functionality of the software  requiring recognition of software license revenue at the time of delivery of the software 
however as a result of this review  we have now decided that when implementation fees are received for specific types of transactions in which we are licensing software and performing certain implementation services  these services are more properly considered essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement 
therefore  the related license revenue and implementation revenue should have been recognized as the services were performed using the percentage of completion method rather than upon delivery of the software 
the impact of these revisions on total revenue was to defer the timing of revenue recognition for transactions that combine both a software license and implementation services 
as a result of the impact of changes in the timing of revenue recognition  we have also revised the related royalty expense  commission expense and federal income tax provision benefit  and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january  of million 
during the review  we also determined that deferred maintenance revenue recorded at the time of the acquisition of check solutions on june  was not correct and resulted in recording maintenance revenue in periods subsequent to the acquisition in excess of the appropriate amounts 
as a result  goodwill and deferred revenue were overstated in the purchase price allocation by million 
we also determined that revenue was understated on two contracts  resulting in additional license fee revenue of million during the quarterly period ended april and implementation fee revenue of  over the period july through july the principal impact of the revenue recognition changes relate to the timing of revenue recognition in our restated financial statements 
timing changes generally resulted in a deferral of revenue recognition  causing offsetting increases and decreases in revenues and  to a lesser extent  related expenses for each accounting period 
while in some instances the net effect on previously reported revenues and net income in a given accounting period was not material  the impact was material in a number of quarterly periods  particularly in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  as well as the first and second quarters of fiscal the second and fourth quarters of fiscal were negatively impacted due  in part  to the deferral of the large dollar volume of software license fees generated following our acquisition of check solutions company 
as originally recorded  the software license fees were recognized during these quarterly periods 
as restated  recognition of these fees has been deferred and recognized over the period of implementation  which resulted in a positive impact on the first and second quarters of fiscal the acquisition of check solutions occured during the second quarter of fiscal  and did not generate any roll forward of license revenues to benefit future periods because of the requirement to eliminate such deferrals as of the acquisition date 
as a result  future quarters did not benefit from any roll forward of check solutions license revenues to offset amounts that were deferred in those quarters as a result of the restatement 
as to the financial impact of the restatement going forward  while under our prior revenue recognition policies we did not carry material amounts of deferred license revenue from period to period  the restatement resulted in our exiting fiscal with incremental deferred license revenue backlog of million to be recognized in future periods 
results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended january   and is based upon data derived from the statements of operations contained in our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the following table sets forth this data as a percentage of total revenues 
the period to period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results

the period to period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
year ended january  restated restated cost of revenues consulting fees software license fees software maintenance fees software implementation fees out of pocket expenses see note of the notes of consolidated financial statements for information regarding restatement of fiscal years ended january  and comparison of year ended january  fiscal to year ended january  fiscal and year ended january  fiscal revenues revenues our total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and increased in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the increases in software license fees  software maintenance fees and software implementation fees derived from a full year contribution from check solutions as well as growth in revenue enhancement consulting revenues 
growth in revenues peaked during the first two quarters and declined during the second half of fiscal economic conditions and delays in customer purchase decisions have slowed sales 
we expect this trend to continue until economic conditions improve 
in fiscal  the increased software license  software maintenance and software implementation revenues from the acquisition of check solutions in june were offset by declines in consulting fees in both our revenue enhancement and global payments consulting business segments attributable to decreased discretionary it spending and fewer bank consolidations and mergers 
consulting fees revenues from consulting fees decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and decreased in fiscal from million in fiscal the consulting fees derived from our global payments consulting business segment decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was partially offset by higher consulting fees from the revenue enhancement business segment  which increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we continue to shift the focus of the global payments consulting business segment from increasing productivity and consolidating redundant operations to formulating enterprise wide payments strategy  risk management strategy  technology architecture design and image enablement plan  and integration 
this shift  in response to our market  has resulted in lower consulting revenues 
within the revenue enhancement business segment  we have been successful in generating revenue from our existing customer base 
we have also been successful in increasing our revenue enhancement consulting services to smaller financial institutions with the introduction of specifically designed offerings for these institutions 
the consulting fees derived from the global payments consulting business segment decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal additionally  consulting fees derived from the revenue enhancement business segment decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during fiscal one of the major drivers of our growth  financial institution consolidations  began to decrease significantly  negatively affecting the demand for our consulting services 
with discretionary it spending already on a downward trend  the events of september  negatively affected customer purchasing decisions 
software license fees revenues from software license fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased in fiscal from million in fiscal most of our software licenses fees are derived from our global payments technologies business segment  which includes the operations of check solutions following our acquisition of that company in june in fiscal  our operations included check solutions for the entire fiscal year and software license fees derived from check solutions products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal if the fiscal check solutions software license fees were annualized  the year over year growth in fiscal would have been 
the heritage carreker software products decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased in fiscal from million in fiscal increases during fiscal  are principally attributed to two major factors the settlement of the pegasystems  inc litigation in the quarter ended october   which cleared the way for us to begin to license and market our back office processing solutions and the acceptance of our image processing software namely check image capture and check image archive management products within the marketplace 
our image processing software is in use at the federal reserve system and at major providers of image archive services in both the united states and canada 
license revenue during the first two quarters peaked due to sales of software expansion licenses and licenses requiring no implementation services which normally spread revenues over multiple quarters 
in the latter half of fiscal the number and dollar amount of our software license arrangements have decreased as compared to the first half of fiscal this decrease is a result of stagnant economic conditions and delayed customer purchasing decisions 
we expect this trend to continue until technology spending improves 
software maintenance fees revenues from software maintenance fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased in fiscal from million in fiscal as with software license fees  the majority of our maintenance fees are derived from our global payments technologies business segment  which includes the operations of check solutions following our acquisition of that company in june in fiscal  our operations included check solutions for the entire fiscal year and software maintenance fees derived from check solutions products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal if the fiscal check solutions software maintenance fees were annualized  the year over year growth in fiscal would have been 
the heritage carreker software maintenance fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased in fiscal from million in fiscal software maintenance fees represent annually renewable product and telephone support for our software customers 
we defer revenue recognition on maintenance billings until cash is collected 
due to the delays in maintenance renewals during the fourth quarter of fiscal  fourth quarter maintenance revenue was approximately million lower than expected 
the overall increases in maintenance fees  in both fiscal and fiscal are due to an expanded product installation base of the check solutions products acquired 
the heritage carreker software maintenance fees have increased as a result of increased revenue from both our fraud mitigation and cash software solutions 
also  maintenance contracts usually carry annual maintenance fee escalation clauses usually between 
growth in software maintenance fees is projected to grow at slower rates in the future due to slower growth in software license fees 
software implementation fees revenues from software implementation fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased in fiscal from million in fiscal the majority of our software implementation fees are derived from our global payments technologies business segment  which includes the operations of check solutions following our acquisition of that company in june in fiscal  our operations included check solutions for the entire fiscal year and software implementation fees derived from check solutions products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal if the fiscal check solutions software implementation fees were annualized  the year over year comparison would reflect a decline of approximately in fiscal the heritage carreker product software implementation fees decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and were basically flat in fiscal as compared to fiscal in the majority of our customer arrangements  installation services are provided to the customer 
however  in fiscal several large software licenses including approximately million of image processing software  were licensed without our implementation services  which partially offset our overall implementation fee gains 
the lack of growth within the heritage carreker products is primarily attributed to the product mix being licensed and pricing pressures 
growth in software implementation fees is projected to grow at slower rates in the future due to slower growth in software license fees 
out of pocket expense reimbursements revenues from out of pocket expense reimbursements decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in these reimbursements in both periods is primarily due to the decline in our global payments consulting business segment 
the majority of these engagements require our employees to be at the customer location for extended periods of time  which gives rise to out of pocket expense reimbursements 
cost of revenues cost of revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  cost of revenue decreased to in fiscal from in  but increased from in fiscal the decrease in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal was related to the million impairment charge for the vault software acquired in the x port business combination 
additionally  we recorded a charge of million for impairment of the value of the guaranteed royalty payments with exchange applications  inc within our revenue enhancement and global payments consulting business segments  cost reduction efforts were carried out in the latter half of fiscal these efforts resulted in a decrease of approximately million from lower personnel costs such as salaries and travel along with a reduction in the use of third party contractors 
these decreases were offset by an approximate million increase from a full year of costs from check solutions 
the year over year growth in fiscal can be attributed to both the write off of vault software and the prepaid royalty with exchange applications  inc previously discussed and the increase in cost of revenues of approximately million following our acquisition of check solutions in june cost of consulting cost of consulting consists of primarily personnel costs related to our consulting engagements within our revenue enhancement and global payments consulting business segments 
the cost of consulting decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased from million in fiscal as a percentage of consulting fees revenue  cost of consulting decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  but increased from in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily related to reduced personnel and contract labor costs through cost reduction efforts  especially within our global payments consulting business segment 
these cost reductions were consistent with our expected decline in consulting revenues 
the fiscal increase in the percentage of the cost of consulting as a percentage of consulting fees revenue is primarily related to decreased consulting fee revenue due to the decline in both financial institution consolidations and discretionary it spending 
the unanticipated events of september  also negatively affected customer purchasing decisions 
because the majority of our consulting fee revenue is derived from value priced engagements within our revenue enhancement business segment  which engagements fluctuate significantly from period to period in both number and dollar value  the gross margins also fluctuate based on the amount of value priced consulting fee revenue recognized in each period 
cost of software licenses cost of software licenses consists principally of amortization of capitalized and acquired software costs and royalties payable to third parties 
cost of software licenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased from million in fiscal as a percentage of software license fees  cost of software licenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and decreased from in fiscal despite the relatively fixed nature of the amortization of the capitalized software costs and acquired technology costs  cost of software license as a percentage of software license fees will fluctuate based on the level of software revenue recognized 
in connection with software license and maintenance agreements entered into with certain banks and purchase agreements with vendors under which we acquired software technology used in products sold to our customers  we are required to pay royalties on sales of certain software products  including four back office products and the branch truncation management product 
under these arrangements  we accrue royalty expense when the associated revenue is recognized 
the royalty percentages generally range from to of the associated revenue 
approximately million  million and million of royalty expense was recorded under these agreements in the fiscal years ended january   and  respectively 
royalty expense is included as a component of the cost of software license fees and cost of software maintenance fees in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
depending on our future product mix  our margins from software license fees may be negatively impacted by increased software royalty expense 
write off of capitalized software costs and prepaid software royalties during the quarterly period ended july   in connection with our periodic impairment review of our portfolio of software products  the vault software acquired in the x port business combination in may was deemed to be impaired 
based on our calculation of the expected cash flows of the product  a million non cash charge was recorded 
the charge resulted from the loss of two key transactions and the projected changes in the approach to selling and delivering the software and related services under a time or usage model 
effective march   we entered into an alliance with exchange applications  inc xchange 
as part of this alliance we became the exclusive provider of the enact customer relationship software and methodology to the banking industry 
under the enact agreement  we became obligated for guaranteed royalty payments of million 
based on our periodic evaluation of the future cash flows associated with this product  a liability for the remaining million obligation was accrued at october   and the carrying value of the prepaid software royalties  at that time  of million was reduced to zero 
this resulted in a charge of million to costs of revenue during the quarterly period ended october  during december  we negotiated with xchange and received a commitment for  as a partial offset to expenses incurred to enhance and support the enact software for the existing customer base 
we reflected the  reimbursement as a ratable reduction in costs of revenue over the period november  through april  during the quarterly period ended january   in connection with our periodic impairment review of our portfolio of software products  the eimanager product acquired in the ais business combination in january was deemed to be impaired 
based on the company s calculation of the expected future cash flows of the product  a  non cash charge was recorded 
effective june  we entered into a software license agreement with actuate corporation in which the company would integrate actuate corporation s software with our global tracking and cash solutions within the global payments technologies business segment 
we prepaid  for copies of the software 
based on the expected sales forecasts of this product a  non cash charge was recorded in the quarterly period ended january  these costs are summarized below in thousands write off of capitalized software costs and prepaid software royalties year ended january  capitalized x port vault product costs  write off of prepaid software royalties with exchange applications  inc total recorded in the year ended january   year ended january  capitalized eimanager product costs write off of prepaid software royalties with actuate corporation 
total recorded in the year ended january  cost of software maintenance cost of software maintenance consists primarily of personnel and facility costs to provide product and customer support activities 
costs of software maintenance increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased from million in fiscal as a percentage of software maintenance fees  cost of maintenance decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  but increased from in fiscal the year over year increase in cost of maintenance in fiscal resulted from our operations containing check solutions for the entire fiscal year 
the amount of this increase was million 
the heritage carreker maintenance costs increased approximately  the year over year increase in cost of maintenance in fiscal is a result of the addition of check solutions following the acquisition of that company in june the amount of these costs in fiscal was million 
additionally  the heritage carreker maintenance costs increased million in fiscal costs of maintenance and cost of maintenance as a percentage of maintenance revenue fluctuates as a result of the timing related to the introduction of new products  a trend we expect to continue 
in the first and second quarters of fiscal  we introduced several new fraud mitigation products derived from the heritage carreker product suite that resulted in increased maintenance costs 
in fiscal  we released two new products 
we released icom  an internet based cash inventory management tool and adjustments express  an image enabled  automated adjustment solution derived from the check solutions acquisition 
cost of software implementation cost of software implementation increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased from million in fiscal as a percentage of software implementation fees  cost of software implementations increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and increased from in fiscal the acquisition of check solutions increased these costs of software implementation million and million during fiscal years and  respectively 
the underlying heritage carreker costs of software implementation were essentially flat for fiscal as compared to fiscal however  in fiscal the heritage carreker cost of implementations increased million as compared to fiscal the addition of the enact customer relationship software and methodology obtained from an alliance with xchange accounts for approximately million with the balance resulting from non billable time and travel  which was due to delays in implementation efforts caused by the litigation with pegasystems  inc  during the latter half of fiscal this increase can be attributed to pricing pressure resulting in reduced margins and competitive pressures from both third parties and customer staff availability 
out of pocket expenses these costs represent travel  meals and other sundry expenses incurred by our employees 
these costs are invoiced to the customer  without mark up  usually on a monthly basis 
certain customer contracts do contain expense maximums  so in certain cases not all expenses incurred can be passed along to the customer 
operating costs and expenses selling general and administrative selling general and administrative expenses generally consist of personnel costs such as salaries  commissions and other incentive compensation along with travel associated with selling  marketing  general management and software management 
additionally  the provision for doubtful accounts  as well as professional services and other related costs are classified within selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  our operations included check solutions for the entire fiscal year and selling  general and administrative costs attributed to check solutions increased to million from million in fiscal we have continued to control costs through reduced staffing levels  however these efforts have been offset by increases in professional services and also increased health insurance and directors and officers insurance 
the year over year increase in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  resulted from our operations including check solutions following our acquisition of that company in june the acquisition increased selling  general and administrative expenses by million 
the underlying heritage carreker selling  general and administrative cost also increased million from increased personnel costs  contract labor  travel and infrastructure costs related to the implementation of the peoplesoft erp system 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  contract labor  travel and facilities expenses incurred by our research and development organization 
these expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing of total revenues in fiscal  of total revenues in and of total revenues in fiscal in fiscal  our operations included check solutions for the entire fiscal year  and research and development expenses related to check solutions decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the check solutions decrease is primarily the result of the expenses related to the development of their adjustments express back office solution  which was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal the heritage carreker research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  but decreased from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal is a result of less capitalized development projects in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in research and development costs in fiscal was the result of the discontinuance of the checkflow suite during july in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer equipment to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  we capitalized  in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and  in fiscal the capitalization of checkflow services packs no 
and no 
was million and  in fiscal and  respectively 
this version was never released due to our decision to no longer actively market the base checkflow product in july these costs were written off as a component of merger  restructuring and other charges in the second quarter of fiscal other capitalized research and development projects in fiscal consisted of million for icom  an enterprise wide cash inventory management tool and million related to four products within our fraud mitigation solution line 
software development costs of a product are capitalized from the time technological feasibility is reached until the general release of the product 
we establish technological feasibility through the process of creating a detailed program design and reviewing the detailed program design for any high risk development issues 
capitalization only occurs if we believe costs capitalized are recoverable through future sales of the software product under development 
we expect a higher level of capitalized software development in fiscal amortization of goodwill and intangible assets amortization of goodwill and intangible assets decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the amortization results from the periodic recognition of amortization expense of intangible customer relationships acquired in the check solutions acquisition 
the reduction in amortization of million was caused by the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and no 
effective february  with the adoption of these standards  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles ceased to be amortized 
see further discussion in note and to our consolidated financial statements regarding the adoption of sfas no 
and no 
goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of the year ended january   the company performed its annual evaluation for goodwill impairment resulting in a charge of million 
the impairment charge was recorded to the global payments technologies gpt segment as all of the company s goodwill has been assigned to the gpt segment 
the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned was determined to be less than its carrying amount 
thus  an allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit was made to determine the excess of fair value over amounts allocated to net assets 
the excess represents the estimated fair value of the goodwill which was compared to recorded goodwill as of the evaluation date of november  and resulted in an impairment charge of million 
the fair values used in this evaluation were estimated based upon the consideration of a number of fair value estimation techniques including a discounted cash flow analysis and consideration of the market price of the company s stock 
the assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis include future revenue volume levels  price levels and rates of increases in operating expenses to compute projected cash flows for the reporting unit and other intangible assets within the reporting unit 
a discount rate of was applied to determine discounted cash flows 
the company believes the assumptions used to estimate future cash flows for this evaluation are reasonable 
however  if market conditions continue to deteriorate  discount rates increase or if changes occur in the estimated projections with respect to the gpt business  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges  the amount of which could be material to the company s results of operations 
merger  restructuring and other charges we recorded various merger  restructuring and other charges during the fiscal years ended january  and as follows in thousands workforce reductions charges relating to checkflow suite facility closures other total fiscal year ended january  quarterly period ending july    quarterly period ending october   quarterly period ending january   total year ended january    fiscal year ended january  quarterly period ending january  total year ended january  in connection with the acquisition of check solutions during the quarter ended july   we recorded million in merger related costs consisting of million attributable to cost of revenues  million attributable to research and development  and million attributable to selling  general and administrative costs 
included in this charge was million of cash termination benefits associated with the separation of employees 
most of the affected employees left their positions during the quarterly period ending october  after an extensive review of the checkflow suite product line  management determined that the checkflow suite was no longer viable in the market in the form originally developed 
we developed the checkflow suite with pegasystems  inc pega under a product development  distribution and sublicensing agreement effective may  the agreement 
pega filed suit to restrain us from developing  marketing  licensing  advertising  leasing  or selling any products  including certain back office products acquired during the check solutions business combination  that allegedly competed with the products jointly developed under the agreement 
the charges related to the discontinuance of the checkflow suite and the estimated settlement with pega were as follows in thousands write off of capitalized software costs  settlements and estimated implementation costs for existing checkflow customer  write off of prepaid royalties previously paid to pega estimated settlement with pega  total  in connection with the check solutions acquisition  a million in process research and development charge was recorded reflecting the estimated fair value of acquired research and development projects at check solutions  which have not yet reached technological feasibility 
included in the merger  restructuring and other charges recorded is a facility closure charge of  for office space  which will no longer be utilized 
on october   the delaware chancery court granted pega s motion for preliminary injunction 
on november   all matters relating to various legal and administrative actions surrounding this dispute were settled 
under this settlement agreement  we agreed to pay settlement and legal costs totaling million of which million was accrued at july   which includes royalties on prior period sales of the four back office products 
consistent with the prior agreement  we will continue to pay pega royalties based on future sales of the four back office products through october  the resulting settlement and legal costs incurred in excess of the initial million accrual recorded in the period ended july  were recorded as a component of merger  restructuring and other charges in the quarterly period ended october  during the quarterly period ended january   we implemented a reduction in the workforce to adjust staffing levels to a level sufficient to support projected business activities 
primarily  as a result of the reductions approximately employees were terminated and a charge of million  related to severance costs including the termination of the agreement with the former owner of x port  and an additional  for facility closures and  of additional charges related to the checkflow suite 
during the quarterly period ended january   we recorded a charge of  relating to a reduction in the workforce for employees that were terminated 
the activity related to the accrued merger and restructuring charge reserve balance during the years ended january  and is as follows in thousands workforce reductions charges relating to checkflow suite facility closures other total reserve balance at january  additions to reserve balance merger  restructuring and other charges   reductions to reserve balances cash paid    non cash charges against reserve   reserve balance at january    additions to reserve balance merger  restructuring and other charges reductions to reserve balances cash paid    reserve balance at january   during the quarterly period ended january   we recorded a charge of million for professional fees related to the special investigation and restatement of our financial statements  of which million remains accrued at january  other income expense other income and expense is comprised mainly of interest income and interest expense 
interest income consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased from million in fiscal the decreases primarily result from lower average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances resulting from the use of million of cash and short term investments to fund the check solutions acquisition 
interest expense is primarily the result of borrowings used to fund the check solutions acquisition in june interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from  in fiscal a full year of interest expense on long term borrowings we committed to in june to finance a portion of the check solutions acquisition is reflected in fiscal as compared to just eight months in fiscal this increase was offset by lower interest rates and the pay down of million on the revolving credit agreement during fiscal the other income amount in fiscal is comprised mainly of foreign currency gains and losses 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes is based on the estimated annual effective tax rate  and includes federal  state and foreign income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the lower tax rates in fiscal and were due to losses we incurred from which we have not yet obtained a tax benefit 
for us to realize the benefit of our net operating loss carryforward and other deferred tax assets recorded as of january   we must generate future taxable income 
due to significant losses incurred in both fiscal and  we concluded that the more likely than not criteria required for recognition of deferred tax assets under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes was not met at both january  and thus  a valuation allowance was recorded in both fiscal and to fully reserve the net deferred tax assets which resulted in the unbenefitted losses 
on march   the federal tax law changed to allow net operating losses for taxable years ending in and to be carried back an additional three years 
consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 the impact of this change in tax law and related five year carryback was not used in the determination of the company s tax provision and related deferred tax valuation allowance for the year ended january  the impact from this change in tax law  including any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the expanded carryback period  was reflected in our tax provision for the quarterly period ended april  this resulted in a tax benefit of approximately million in fiscal which was partially offset by state and foreign taxes 
at january   we had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  which expire in selected consolidated quarterly results of operations unaudited the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly data for each of our last eight quarters ended january  we believe all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations of the company have been made

our quarterly results may vary significantly depending primarily on factors  such as timing of contract execution and revenue recognition  increases in costs beyond anticipated levels  especially in the context of costs incurred under value pricing contracts  the degree of customer acceptance of new solutions  fluctuations or delays in schedules for implementation of software licensed to customers  the introduction of new or enhanced solutions by us or our competitors  our mix of revenues derived from consulting and management service fees on the one hand  and software related fees on the other  customer budget cycles and priorities and purchasing cycles  competitive conditions in the industry  seasonal factors  war  terrorist acts and civil unrest  timing of consolidation decisions by customers  the extent of customers international expansion  and general economic conditions 
because of the above factors  along with items such as merger  restructuring and other charges and write off of capitalized software costs and prepaid software royalties  the results of any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results for the full year 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations and cash expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities 
at january   we had working capital of million compared to million at january  we had million in cash and cash equivalents at january   an increase of million from million in cash and cash equivalents at january  at january   we had million of long term debt compared to million at january  we expect that existing cash and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated requirements for the foreseeable future 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal and cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal operating cash flows increased during the fiscal year ended january  as a result of efforts to reduce our headcount in fiscal compared to this increase was offset by the payment of incentive compensation amounts in the quarterly period ended april  to both current and former check solutions employees 
average days sales outstanding fluctuate for a variety of reasons  including the timing of billings specified by contractual agreement  and receivables for expense reimbursements 
the following table contains the quarterly days sales outstanding dso quarter ended dso january  october  july  april  january  the increase in dso for the quarterly period ended october  can be primarily attributed to a decrease in total revenues from the quarterly period ended july  along with a increase in the accounts receivable balance over the same period 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  and was primarily related to the purchases of property and equipment 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  and was primarily related to the acquisition of check solutions company 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million  and was primarily related to the purchase of two companies  automated integrated solutions  inc and x port software  inc  along with purchases of property and equipment 
we expect purchases of property and equipment in fiscal to be consistent with  although we do believe that capitalized computer costs will be more consistent with fiscal amounts 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal  and provided cash of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the cash used in financing activities during fiscal was comprised of million of payments on our revolving credit agreement offset by million of stock option proceeds and proceeds from a private placement of our common stock on april  the net proceeds from the private placement of million were used to satisfy obligations due certain employees of check solutions of approximately million with the remainder used for working capital 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from million drawn on our revolving credit agreement entered into to partially fund the check solutions acquisition 
the cash provided by financing activities in fiscal related to our public offering of  shares of common stock on november   which resulted in net proceeds of million after deducting the costs of the offering 
on june   we entered into a three year revolving credit agreement with a group of banks in an amount not to exceed million to fund the acquisition of check solutions 
at january  and  we had outstanding borrowings of million and million  respectively  under the credit agreement 
all outstanding borrowings are due on june  borrowings under the credit agreement currently bear interest equal to either the greater of prime or federal funds rate plus a margin ranging from to depending on our ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda  or london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin equal to to depending on our ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
interest payments are due quarterly 
we are required to pay a commitment fee equal to to depending on our ratio of funded debt to ebitda on the unused amount of the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  some of which have been amended  including financial covenants requiring the maintenance of specified interest coverage  ratio of ebitda to funded debt  and ratio of accounts receivable  cash and short term investments to funded debt 
additionally  the payment of dividends is precluded subject to the approval of the banks 
substantially all of our assets collateralize this revolving credit agreement 
during the quarter ended january   we were granted a waiver until april  to file our quarterly financial statements and corresponding compliance certification for the quarter ended october  we were granted a waiver of an event of default arising as a result of any inaccuracy in  or misstatement of  the financial statements or required certificates previously filed arising from the restatement of the financial statements 
the banks have also consented to the addition of the goodwill impairment charge to net income loss in the calculation of ebitda 
as of january   we are in compliance with the covenants of the revolving credit agreement  as amended 
while there can be no assurance  we believe we will continue to meet these covenants during the year ended january  any instances of non compliance would negatively impact our liquidity 
between february  and april   an additional million was paid reducing outstanding borrowings to million 
at january   we had material commitments for our operating leases  as described in note in our notes to consolidated financial statements  including commitments of approximately million in fiscal in fiscal  we expect capital expenditures to be similar to levels experienced in fiscal the following summarizes our contractual obligations at january  and the effect these contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period total year or less years after years revolving credit agreement   operating leases     on april   we sold  shares of our common stock to a group of investors in a private transaction 
we utilized the approximately million of net proceeds that were received from the sale to satisfy existing obligations due to certain former employees of check solutions  with the remainder being used for working capital 
see note in notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that current cash balances and expected future cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and other activities during fiscal however  if current sources are not sufficient to meet our needs  we may seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the company is presently involved in a number of class action lawsuits 
the potential outcomes or resolutions of the class action lawsuits are unknown  but could include judgments against us  or settlements that could require substantial payments by us 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
further  we may in the future pursue acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that could complement or expand our business and product offerings  and could change our financing needs 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary 
the failure to secure additional financing when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we use certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and our estimates may vary from actual results 
we consider the following four accounting policies as the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ  and such differences could be significant to our financial results 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
in the case of software arrangements that require significant production  modification  or customization of software  or the license agreement requires the company to provide implementation services that are determined to be essential to other elements of the arrangement  the company follows the guidance in sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
consulting fees 
we employ three primary pricing methods in connection with our delivery of consulting services 
first  we may price our delivery of consulting services on the basis of time and materials  in which case the customer is charged agreed upon daily rates for services performed and out of pocket expenses 
in this case  we are generally paid fees and related amounts on a monthly basis  and we recognize revenues as the services are performed 
second  we may deliver consulting services on a fixed price basis 
in this case  we are generally paid on a monthly basis or pursuant to an agreed upon payment schedule  and we recognize revenues paid on a percentage of completion basis 
we believe that this method is appropriate because of our ability to determine performance milestones and determine dependable estimates of our costs applicable to each phase of a contract 
because financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contract  costs are subject to revisions as the contract progresses 
anticipated losses on fixed priced contracts are recognized when estimable 
third  we may deliver consulting services pursuant to a value priced contract with the customer 
in this case  we are paid  on an agreed upon basis with the customer  either a specified percentage of the projected increased revenues and or decreased costs that are expected to be derived by the customer generally over a period of up to twelve months following implementation of our solution or the actual increased revenues and or decreased costs experienced by the customer generally over a period of up to twelve months following implementation of our solution  subject in either case to a maximum  if any is agreed to  on the total amount of payments to be made to us 
we must first commit time and resources to develop projections associated with value pricing contracts before a bank will commit to purchase our solutions  and we therefore assume the risk of making these commitments with no assurance that the bank will purchase the solution 
costs associated with these value pricing contracts are expensed as incurred 
these contracts typically provide for us to receive a percentage of the projected or actual increased revenues and or decreased costs  with payments to be made to us pursuant to an agreed upon schedule ranging from one to twelve months in length 
we recognize revenues generated from consulting services in connection with value priced contracts based upon projected results only upon completion of all services and agreement upon the actual fee to be paid even though billings for these services may be delayed by mutual agreement for periods not to exceed twelve months 
in an effort to allow customers to more closely match expected benefits from our services with payments to us  we may offer payment terms which extend beyond months 
when we enter into an agreement that has a significant component of the total amount payable under the agreement due beyond months and it is determined payments are not fixed and determinable at the date the agreement is entered into  revenue under the arrangement will be recognized as payments become due and payable 
when fees are to be paid based on a percentage of actual revenues and or savings to our customers  we recognize revenues only upon completion of all services and as the amounts of actual revenues or savings are confirmed by the customer with a fixed payment date 
costs associated with time and materials  fixed priced and value priced consulting fee arrangements are expensed as incurred and are included as a component of the cost of consulting fees 
we expect that value priced contracts will continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the future 
as a consequence of the use of value priced contracts and due to the revenue recognition policy associated with those contracts  our results of operations will likely fluctuate significantly from period to period 
regardless of the pricing method employed by us in a given contract  we are typically reimbursed on a monthly basis for out of pocket expenses incurred on behalf of our customers 
beginning february   we began to characterize reimbursements for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue in the statement of operations and all comparative statements of operations have been revised to reflect this change 
software license fees 
in the event that a software license is sold either together with implementation services or on a stand alone basis  we are usually paid software license fees in one or more installments  as provided in the customer s contract but not to exceed months 
under sop  we recognize software license revenue upon execution of a contract and delivery of the software  provided that the license fee is fixed and determinable  no significant production  modification or customization of the software is required and collection is considered probable by management 
when the software license arrangement requires us to provide implementation services that are essential to the functionality of the software or significant production  customization or modification of the software  both the product license revenue and implementation fees are recognized as services are performed 
software licenses are often sold as part of a multiple element arrangement that may include maintenance  implementation or consulting 
we determine whether there is vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoefv for each element identified in the arrangement to determine whether the total arrangement fees can be allocated to each element 
if vsoefv exists for each element  the total arrangement fee is allocated based on the relative fair value of each element 
in cases where there is not vsoefv for each element  or if it is determined services are essential to the functionality of the software being delivered  or if significant product modification or customization of the software is required  we defer revenue recognition of the software license fees 
however  if vsoefv is determinable for all of the undelivered elements  and assuming the undelivered elements are not essential to the delivered elements  we will defer recognition of the full fair value related to the undelivered elements and recognize the remaining portion of the arrangement value through application of the residual method as set forth in sop where vsoefv has not been established for certain undelivered elements  revenue for all elements is deferred until those elements have been delivered or their fair values have been determined 
evidence of vsoefv is determined for software products based on actual sales prices for the product sold to a similar class of customer and based on pricing strategies set forth in our price book 
evidence of vsoefv for services implementation and consulting is based upon standard billing rates and the estimated level of effort for individuals expected to perform the related services 
we establish vsoefv for maintenance agreements using the percentage method such that vsoefv for maintenance is a percentage of the license fee charged annually for specific software product  which in most instances is of the portion of arrangement fees allocated to the software license element 
although substantially all of our current software licenses provide for a fixed price license fee  some licenses provide for the customer to pay a monthly license fee based on the actual use of the software product 
the level of license fees earned by us under this arrangement will vary based on the actual amount of use by the customer 
revenue under these arrangements is recognized on a monthly basis 
software maintenance fees 
in connection with our sale of a software license  a customer may elect to purchase software maintenance services 
most of the customers that purchase software licenses from us also purchase software maintenance services  which typically are renewed annually 
we charge an annual maintenance fee  which is typically a percentage of the initial software license fee 
the annual maintenance fee generally is paid to us at the beginning of the maintenance period  and we recognize these revenues ratably over the term of the related contract 
if the annual maintenance fee is not paid at the beginning of the maintenance period  we defer revenue recognition until the time the maintenance fee is paid by the customer 
software implementation fees 
in connection with the sale of a software license  a customer may elect to purchase software implementation services  including software enhancements  patches and other software support services 
most of the customers that purchase software licenses from us also purchase software implementation services 
we price our implementation services on a time and material or on a fixed price basis  and we recognize the related revenues as services are performed 
costs associated with these engagements are expensed as incurred 
royalties in connection with software license and maintenance agreements entered into with certain banks and purchase agreements with vendors under which we acquired software technology used in products sold to its customers  we are required to pay royalties on sales of certain software products  including four back office products and branch truncation management product 
under these arrangements  we accrue royalty expense when the associated revenue is recognized 
the royalty percentages generally range from of the associated revenues 
royalty expense is included as a component of the cost of software license fees and cost of software maintenance fees in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts a large proportion of our revenues and receivables are attributable to our customers in the banking industry 
our trade accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from our customers 
because our accounts receivable are typically unsecured  we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our accounts based on a combination of factors  including a particular customer s ability to pay as well as the age of receivables 
in cases where the evidence suggests a customer may not be able to satisfy its obligation to us or if the collection of the receivable becomes doubtful due to a dispute that arises subsequent to the delivery of our products and services  we set up a specific reserve in an amount we determine appropriate for the perceived risk 
if circumstances change  such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet their financial obligations to us  our estimates of recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
software costs capitalized  goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets software costs capitalized include developed technology acquired in acquisitions and costs incurred by us in developing our products which qualify for capitalization 
we capitalize our development costs of software  other than internal use software  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas 
our policy is to capitalize software development costs incurred in developing a product once technological feasibility of the product has been established 
software development costs capitalized also include amounts paid for purchased software on products that have reached technological feasibility 
technological feasibility of the product is determined after completion of a detailed program design and a determination has been made that any uncertainties related to high risk development issues have been resolved 
if the process of developing the product does not include a detailed program design  technological feasibility is determined only after completion of a working model which has been beta tested 
all software development costs capitalized are amortized using an amount determined as the greater of i the ratio that current gross revenues for a capitalized software project bears to the total of current and future projected gross revenues for that project or ii the straight line method over the remaining economic life of the product generally three to six years 
through january   goodwill and other intangible assets were amortized using the straight line method over lives of to years 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas effective february  under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are no longer amortized 
see recently issued accounting standards in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are assessed on an annual basis for impairment at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value based test 
we performed the initial impairment test of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives assets at february  the initial impairment analysis did not result in any write down of capitalized costs 
we perform an annual impairment assessment on november st of each year  or when factors indicate that other long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows over the remaining life of the asset to determine if impairment has occurred 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent from other asset groups 
an impairment in the carrying value of an asset is assessed when the undiscounted  expected future operating cash flows derived from the asset are less than its carrying value 
management believes that assumptions used to determine cash flows are reasonable  but actual future cash flows may differ from those estimated 
if we determine an asset has been impaired  the impairment is recorded based on the estimated fair value of the impaired asset 
during the quarterly period ended january   events and circumstances caused us to reevaluate goodwill resulting in an impairment charge of million 
goodwill at january  totaled million 
further deterioration in market conditions  increases in interest rates or changes in our projections with respect to the global payments technologies reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated would result in additional impairment charges in the future 
merger  restructuring and other charges during fiscal years and  we recorded significant reserves in connection with our acquisition of check solutions and subsequent operational restructurings 
these reserves contain significant estimates pertaining to work force reductions  and the settlement of contractual obligations resulting from our actions 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments of outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount or reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in insurance coverage or approach such as change in settlement strategy 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of our cumulative net losses we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
in addition  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance of any future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize these assets 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addressed accounting for reorganization and similar costs 
sfas supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of a company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may affect timing of recognizing any future reorganization costs as well as the amount recognized 
the provisions of sfas are effective for reorganization activities initiated after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas requires prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation and amends apb opinion  interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
these disclosure requirements are effective for our fiscal year ended january  in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
it also addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
the guidance in eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   with early application permitted 
companies may elect to report the change in accounting as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion  accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 

we do not currently believe adoption will have a significant impact on our accounting for multiple element arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments 
these investments are denominated in us dollars and maintained with nationally recognized financial institutions  and mutual fund companies 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
we treat all of our cash equivalents and short term investments as available for sale under sfas investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investment securities are held for purposes other than trading 
at january   we did not hold any fixed rate investments 
we currently have million outstanding under our revolving credit agreement at january  as described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements  the interest rate is variable 
at january   the interest rate on million of the debt was and the interest rate on million of the debt was 
foreign currency risk we currently have operations in several international locations including canada  united kingdom  south africa and australia 
as a result  we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
due to the nature of these operations  we currently utilize the us dollar as the functional currency for all international operations 
an insignificant portion of our accounts receivable balance at january   was denominated in a foreign currency 
our exposure to adverse movements to foreign exchange rates is not significant 
therefore  we do not currently hedge our foreign currency exposure  however  we do try to limit our foreign currency exposure by negotiating foreign currency exchange rates within our customer contracts 
historically  foreign currency gains and losses have not had a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
we will continue to evaluate the need to adopt a hedge strategy in the future and may implement a formal strategy if our business transacted in foreign currencies increases
