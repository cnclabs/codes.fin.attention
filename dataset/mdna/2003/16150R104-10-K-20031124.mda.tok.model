critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates the us securities and exchange commission sec has suggested companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results  and require management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies are described below 
accounts receivable the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in cases where the company is aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to it  a specific allowance against amounts due to the company is recorded  and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  the company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and its historical experience 
if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future  which could have an adverse impact on the future operating results of the company 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand and changes in technology 
these assessments require management judgments and estimates  and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments 
the company estimates excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand  product transitions  and market conditions and records reserves to reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
the failure to accurately forecast demand may lead to additional excess an obsolete inventory and future charges 
investment in joint venture the company has an investment in a joint venture related to an area of the company s strategic focus 
the company accounts for this investment using the equity method of accounting 
in assessing the recoverability of this investment  the company must make certain assumptions and judgments based on changes in the company s overall business strategy  the financial condition of the joint venture  market conditions and the industry and economic environment in which the entity operates 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the joint venture could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  thereby requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets long lived assets consist of goodwill  trademarks  patents and agreements and property  plant  and equipment 
intangible assets and property  plant  and equipment  excluding goodwill  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life 
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets is reviewed on a quarterly basis for the existence of facts and circumstances both internally and externally that may suggest impairment 
factors which the company considers important and that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company determines whether an impairment has occurred based on gross expected future cash flows  and measures the amount of the impairment based on the related future discounted cash flows 
the cash flow estimates used to determine impairment  if any  contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings 
in the event of significant inflation  the company s efforts to recover cost increases would be hampered as a result of the competitive nature of its products
