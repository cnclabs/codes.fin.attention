the digital cinema business develops technologies to support the processing  transmission and management of content for a variety of media applications  including the delivery of digitized motion pictures 
qwi revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
our qualcomm strategic initiatives qsi segment makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of cdma products and services for wireless voice and internet data communications 
our strategy has been to invest in cdma operators  licensed device manufacturers and start up companies that we believe open new markets for cdma technology  support the design and introduction of new cdma based products or possess unique capabilities or technology to promote internet data communications 
qsi s revenues relate primarily to the consolidation of our investment in v sper holding 
qsi revenues comprised and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
qsi did not generate revenues in global economic weakness can have wide ranging effects on markets that we serve  particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network operators 
the wireless communications industry recently appears to be recovering from an industry wide recession 
we cannot predict whether a recovery will continue  the rate of such recovery  or what effects negative events  such as war  may have on the economy 
further  an economic recovery may not benefit us in the near term 
if it does not  our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired 
to increase our revenues and market share in future periods  we are dependent 
table of contents upon the adoption and commercial deployment of g wireless communications equipment  products and services based on our cdma technology 
although network operators have commercially deployed cdma x  we cannot predict the timing or success of other commercial deployments 
if existing deployments are not commercially successful  or if new commercial deployments of cdma x are delayed or unsuccessful  our business and financial results may be harmed 
we currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that competition will continue 
this competition may result in reduced average selling prices for our products and those of our customers and licensees 
reductions in the average selling price of our licensees products generally result in reduced average royalties 
while pricing pressures resulting from competition may  to a large extent  be mitigated by the introduction of new features and functionality in our licensees products  there is no guarantee that such mitigation will occur 
we will continue to expand our international sales operations and enter new international markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to successfully develop direct and indirect international sales and support channels  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that our expenditures in this effort will not exceed the amount of any resulting revenues 
if we are not able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products and technologies  then we may not be able to maintain an acceptable rate of growth in our business 
revenues from customers in south korea  the united states  and japan comprised  and  respectively  of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  as compared to   and  respectively  in fiscal  and  and  respectively  in fiscal we distinguish revenue from external customers by geographic areas based on customer location 
the increase in revenues from customers in south korea  as a percentage of the total  is primarily attributed to higher chipset sales to phone manufacturers in south korea who have leading cdma market share in south korea and worldwide 
the decrease in revenues from customers in the united states and japan  as a percentage of the total  is primarily attributed to overall increases in revenues in geographic regions other than the united states and japan 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  valuation of intangible assets and investments  income taxes  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products  from royalties  from messaging and other services and related hardware sales  from software development and related services  and from license fees for intellectual property 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements which we adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal and applied retroactively to the first quarter of fiscal we recognized million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively  in operating income related to revenue and expense that were recognized in prior years 

table of contents in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables which we adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal this issue addresses determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
beginning with the adoption of sab until the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized revenues and expenses from sales of certain satellite and terrestrial based two way data messaging and position reporting hardware and related software products by our qwbs division ratably over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the hardware product or the expected messaging service period  which is typically five years 
sab required the ratable recognition of these sales because the messaging service was considered integral to the functionality of the hardware and software 
because eitf issue no 
does not require the deferral of revenue when an undelivered element is considered integral to the functionality of a delivered element and because eitf issue no 
otherwise requires separate unit accounting  we began recognizing revenues and expenses from such sales starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal at the time of shipment  or when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and other criteria for revenue recognition are met  if later 
we have elected to adopt eitf issue no 
prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into after the third quarter of fiscal  rather than reporting the change in accounting as a cumulative effect adjustment 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized certain revenue and related cost of sales for qwbs equipment sales upon shipment  while continuing to amortize unearned revenue and cost of sales  with an million gross margin effect  for units shipped in prior periods 
deferred revenues and expenses related to the historical qwbs sales that will continue to be amortized in future periods were million and million  respectively  at september  gross margin related to these prior sales is expected to be recognized as follows million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we license rights to use our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of cdma including cdmaone  cdma x x ev do xev dv  td scdma and wcdma products 
licensees typically pay a non refundable license fee in one or more installments and on going royalties based on their sales of products incorporating our intellectual property 
license fees are generally recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee  typically five to seven years 
we recognize royalty revenue as earned when reasonable estimates of such amounts can be made 
revenues from sales of our cdma based integrated circuits are recognized at the time of shipment  or when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and other criteria for revenue recognition are met  if later 
revenues from providing services are recorded when earned 
revenues from long term contracts are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  based on costs incurred compared with total estimated costs 
the percentage of completion method relies on estimates of total contract revenue and costs 
revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
if actual contract costs are greater than expected  reduction of contract profit would be required 
billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred cost and accrued profits are classified as unearned revenue 
estimated contract losses are recognized when determined 
if substantive uncertainty related to customer acceptance exists or the contract s duration is relatively short  we use the completed contract method 
revenues from software license fees are recognized when all of the following criteria are met the written agreement is executed  the software is delivered  the license fee is fixed and determinable  collectibility of the license fee is probable  and if applicable  when vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total license fee to elements of multiple element arrangements  including post contract customer support 
when contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements and defer revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements until the remaining obligations have been satisfied 
if vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for all undelivered elements  revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements is deferred until remaining obligations have been satisfied  or if the only undelivered element is post contract customer support  revenue is recognized ratably over the support period 
significant judgments and estimates are made in connection with the recognition of software license revenue  including assessments of collectibility and the fair values of deliverable elements 
the amount or timing of our software license revenue may differ as a result of changes in these judgments or estimates 

table of contents unearned revenue consists primarily of fees related to software products and license fees for intellectual property for which delivery is not yet complete and to hardware products sales with a continuing service obligation 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we consider the following factors when determining if collection of a fee is reasonably assured customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms 
if we have no previous experience with the customer  we typically obtain reports from various credit organizations to ensure that the customer has a history of paying its creditors 
we may also request financial information  including financial statements or other documents eg  bank statements to ensure that the customer has the means of making payment 
if these factors do not indicate collection is reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
we also maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of entities we have financed to make required payments 
we evaluate the adequacy of allowances for doubtful finance and note receivables based on analyses of the financed entities credit worthiness  current economic trends or market conditions  review of the entities current and projected financial and operational information  and consideration of the fair value of collateral to be received  if applicable 
from time to time  we may consider third party evaluations  valuation reports or advice from investment banks 
if the financial condition of the financed entities were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
valuation of intangible assets and investments our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  market conditions and other factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we hold minority strategic investments in publicly traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile 
we record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
when assessing a publicly traded investment for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost  the performance of the investee s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations 
we also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we hold minority strategic investments in private companies whose values are difficult to determine 
we record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
when assessing investments in private companies for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  the share price from the investee s latest financing round  the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan  the investee s revenue and cost trends  the liquidity and cash position  including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee s products and services 
from time to time  we may consider third party evaluations  valuation reports or advice from investment banks 
we also consider new products services that the investee may have forthcoming  any significant news that has been released specific to the 
table of contents investee or the investee s competitors and or industry and the outlook of the overall industry in which the investee operates 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
income taxes our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
should the actual results differ from our estimates  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
we reversed approximately billion of our valuation allowance on substantially all of our united states deferred tax assets during fiscal as a credit to stockholders equity 
we now believe that we will more likely than not have sufficient taxable income after stock option deductions to utilize our deferred tax assets 
we continue to provide a valuation allowance on substantially all of our foreign deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their realization due to a history of losses from operations 
we can only use our capital losses and capital loss carrybacks or carryforwards to offset capital gains 
we expect that our future capital gains will be sufficient to utilize the capital losses that we have incurred through fiscal beginning in fiscal  we have provided a valuation allowance for new deferred tax assets related to capital loss items through our statement of operations 
we expect that any additional capital losses in future years will also require the provision of a valuation allowance through the statement of operations  if we are unable to generate sufficient future capital gains to utilize these additional capital losses through our tax planning strategies 
if capital losses are utilized and any portion of the valuation allowance is removed  the release would be accounted for as a reduction of the income tax provision 
we consider the operating earnings of non united states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states 
no provision has been made for united states federal and state  or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
should we repatriate foreign earnings  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries is made 
litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
licensing we grant licenses to use our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of cdma including cdmaone  cdma x xev do xev dv  td scdma and wcdma products 
licensees typically pay a non refundable license fee in one or more installments and on going royalties based on their sales of products incorporating our intellectual property 
license fees are recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee  typically five to seven years 
we earn royalties on cdma products sold worldwide by our licensees in the period that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees  however  do not report and pay royalties owed until the subsequent quarter and  in some instances  payment is on a semi annual basis 
therefore  we estimate the royalty revenues from certain licensees the estimated licensees in the current quarter when reasonable estimates of such amounts can be made 
not all royalties earned are estimated 
royalties for licensees for which we have minimal history and certain licensees that do not buy our integrated circuit products are recorded one quarter in arrears when they are reported to us by those licensees 
estimates of royalty revenues for the estimated licensees are based on analyses of our sales of integrated circuits to our estimated licensees  historical royalty data by estimated licensee  the relationship between the timing of our sales of integrated circuits to our estimated licensees and our estimated licensees sales of cdma products  average sales price forecasts  and current market and economic trends 
once royalty reports are received from the 
table of contents estimated licensees  the variance between such reports and the estimate is recorded in royalty revenue in the period the reports are received 
the recognition of this variance in most cases lags the royalty estimate by one quarter 
the following table summarizes royalty related data for fiscal  and in millions fiscal year components of royalty revenues estimate at end of prior year royalties reported in first quarter related to prior year estimate variance included in current year revenues other royalties reported in current year estimate at year end total royalty revenues from licensees this amount is the estimate for the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year 
for example  for fiscal  we estimated royalties of million from the estimated licensees for the fourth quarter of fiscal the actual royalties reported to us by the estimated licensees  on a one quarter lag basis  during the first quarter of fiscal were million 
the variance of million was recorded in royalty revenues in the first quarter of fiscal therefore  total royalty revenues from licensees for fiscal of million included the variance of million  other royalties reported during fiscal of million  and the estimate made in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million based upon estimated licensees estimated sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which we believe will be reported by the estimated licensees in the first quarter of fiscal strategic investments and financing our qsi segment makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of cdma products and services for wireless voice and internet data communications 
in general  we enter into strategic relationships with cdma wireless operators and developers of innovative technologies or products for the wireless communications industry 
as part of the agreement to sell our infrastructure equipment business to ericsson in  we have provided equipment financing to customers of ericsson on a shared basis with respect to ericsson s sale of cdma infrastructure 
due to financial and competitive challenges facing cdma wireless operators  we cannot assure you that our investments will generate financial returns or that they will result in increased adoption or continued use of cdma technologies 
domestic and international cdma wireless operators to whom we have provided financing have limited operating histories  are faced with significant capital requirements  are highly leveraged and or have limited financial resources 
if these cdma wireless operators are not successful  we may have to write down our investments in or loans to these wireless operators 
our qsi segment maintains strategic holdings of various issuers and types 
these securities include available for sale equity securities and derivative investments that are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
we strategically invest in companies in the high technology industry and typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our exposure to market risks in these investments 
available for sale equity securities and derivative investments recorded at fair value subject us to equity price risk 
the fair values of these strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market price volatility 
our strategic investments in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time  and changes in concentrations may affect price volatility 
in general  our investments in available for sale equity securities and derivative investments suffered significant decreases in market value during the last three years 
downward fluctuations and market trends could further adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the realizable value of these securities and derivative investments is subject to market and other conditions 
qsi also makes strategic investments in privately held companies  including early stage companies and venture funds 
these investments are recorded at cost or under the equity method  but the recorded values may be written down due to changes in the companies conditions or prospects 
these strategic investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products the investees are developing may never materialize 
as a result  we could 
table of contents lose all or a portion of our investments in these companies  which could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 
most of these strategic investments will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of investment  if at all 
to the extent such investments become liquid and meet strategic and price objectives  we may sell the investments and recognize the realized gain loss in investment income expense 
we regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our investments in both marketable and private securities 
if events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary  we will record a charge to investment income expense 
during fiscal  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  in charges related to other than temporary losses on marketable and private securities 
in some cases  we make strategic investments that require us to consolidate or record our equity in the losses of early stage companies 
the consolidation of these losses can adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to the investments 
from time to time  we may accept an equity interest in a licensee as consideration for a portion or all of the license fee payable under our cdma license agreement 
we record license fee revenue based on the fair value of the equity instruments received  if determinable 
the measurement date for determination of fair value is the earlier of the date at which a performance commitment is made or the date at which the performance is complete 
the evaluation procedures used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  examining the current market price for the shares if the licensee is publicly traded  examining recent rounds of financing and the licensee s business plan if not publicly traded  and performing other due diligence procedures 
this equity program does not affect the licensees obligations to pay royalties under their cdma license agreements 
the amount of cash consideration and the timing of revenue recognition vary depending on the terms of each agreement 
as of september   ten licensees have participated in this program 
we recognized million  million and million of revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  related to equity received as consideration for license fees 
v sper holding  ltd 
in fiscal  we acquired an ownership interest in v sper s o paulo sa and v sper sa the v sper operating companies or collectively  v sper 
the v sper operating companies were formed by a consortium of investors to provide fixed wireless and wireline telephone services in the northern  northeast and eastern regions of brazil and in the state of s o paulo 
in addition  we extended long term financing to v sper in fiscal in november  we consummated a series of transactions resulting in an overall financial restructuring the restructuring of the v sper operating companies  which resulted in our obtaining a controlling financial interest in v sper 
pursuant to the restructuring  we invested million  and velocom  inc velocom invested million  in a newly formed holding company called v sper holding  ltd 
v sper holding 
v sper holding acquired certain liabilities of the v sper operating companies from their vendors for million and the issuance of warrants to purchase an approximate interest in v sper holding  and the vendors released in full any claims that they might have against us  velocom  v sper  its direct and indirect parent companies and other related parties arising from or related to the acquired liabilities 
in a series of related transactions  v sper holding agreed to contribute the acquired liabilities to the v sper operating companies in exchange for equity securities and to cancel the contributed liabilities 
on november   we forgave million under our debt facility with velocom 
we also converted our remaining million convertible promissory note into equity securities of velocom in conjunction with our acquisition of v sper holding 
the conversion increased our equity interest in velocom to 
we used the equity method to account for our investment in velocom 
on july   we transferred to velocom all of our equity interest in velocom in exchange for a of the shares of v sper holding held by velocom  which represented approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of v sper holding  and b elimination of velocom s minority consent rights with respect to v sper holding 
we recorded a net loss of million on the exchange resulting primarily from the recognition of cumulative translation losses  previously included in stockholders equity  in the statement of operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal after giving effect to the exchange  we own an approximate direct interest in v sper holding and hold no continuing interest in velocom at september  on november   we won bids to acquire personal mobile service smp licenses in the state of s o paulo excluding s o paulo metro  the state of minas gerais  and in the northeast region of brazil 
approximately million of the approximate million purchase price for the smp licenses was paid in december the 
table of contents remaining brazilian real denominated obligation is financed by the brazilian government at an interest rate of per annum  plus an adjustment for inflation  payable in six equal annual installments starting in fiscal at september   the outstanding license fee obligation was approximately million  having increased as a result of accrued interest and the strengthening of the brazilian real against the us dollar 
due to a series of adverse regulatory developments that negatively affected v sper s prospects  we are pursuing an expedited exit strategy whereby v sper and or its assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
in accordance with this strategy  on september   embratel participa es sa embratel entered into an agreement to acquire from us for nominal consideration the v sper operating companies the embratel sale transaction  excluding the tower and rooftop antennae assets and related property leases tower sites 
concurrent with the closing  v sper will enter into a multi year arrangement whereby it pays a monthly fee to us to use the tower sites 
the sum of these fees  net of certain pass through expenses  is expected to exceed million over the life of the arrangement 
the smp licenses also are not included in the embratel sale transaction  except for a right of first refusal of embratel to purchase the smp licenses in the event of a sale to a third party or return of the smp licenses to anatel  the telecommunications regulatory agency in brazil 
we are evaluating our options with respect to the smp licenses  including a possible return of the licenses to anatel 
the closing of the embratel sale transaction is contingent upon a number of events being completed prior to or concurrent with closing 
the status of certain of these items follows regulatory approval 
regulatory approval from anatel  which was requested on october   is required before a sale can be consummated 
we anticipate a response within approximately days 
v sper bank forbearance 
on september   we and v sper entered into an agreement with local bank creditors of and lessors to v sper the v sper banks concerning v sper s defaults under secured bank loans and leases with such creditors  which defaults occurred and have been continuing since may  pursuant to this agreement  the v sper banks waived existing defaults and agreed to forbear from exercising any remedies under the loans and leases  including forbearing from calling for payment in full of all amounts due under such loans and leases until december  the brazilian real equivalent of approximately million was outstanding under such loans and leases at september  notwithstanding the respective waiver and forbearance from the v sper banks  the v sper operating companies were charged a default penalty and are continuing to charge an additional in interest per month on the amount in default 
the bank loans and leases that are in default are presented on our balance sheet as current liabilities at september  v sper bank settlement and release 
the v sper banks also agreed to discharge all outstanding loans and leases  including default penalties and interest accrued on such amounts  settle all outstanding claims and grant a full and complete release for all obligations with respect to such loans and leases in exchange for a payment of approximately million concurrent with the consummation of the embratel sale transaction 
bell canada international bci  a former shareholder in v sper and a guarantor of a portion of the v sper banks outstanding loans and leases to v sper  is expected to fund million of this amount 
on october   bci received the requisite court order to perform its obligations under agreements in connection with payment of the million settlement  as required under the liquidation laws governing bci in canada 
tower usage agreement 
in connection with the embratel sale transaction  the v sper operating companies will enter into a year tower usage rights agreement  with two consecutive year renewal options  to use specified amounts of space on the tower sites that we will retain 
we will have the ability to sell some or all of our interests in the tower sites and assign the associated rights under this usage rights agreement 
funding 
we are required to provide million in interim funding to v sper on  or prior to  closing of the embratel sale transaction 
given the uncertainty associated with the closing contingencies  we have not presented the v sper related assets and liabilities as held for sale in our september  balance sheet 
further  we do not expect to present v sper s historical operations as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations in future financial statements because of our expectation of a continuing involvement in the v sper business by way of an on going tower usage arrangement 
in the near term  prior to the close of the embratel sale transaction  v sper will 
table of contents continue to operate its existing fixed wireless and wireline network 
v sper will continue to undertake significant cost cutting measures to preserve the value of its core assets and existing business while reducing cash expenditures 
as a result of adverse regulatory developments  and after an evaluation of the potential acquirers and the valuations that they may ascribe to v sper given the regulatory situation  we recorded a million impairment loss on our long lived assets related to v sper during the second quarter of fiscal the impairment loss recognized was the difference between the assets carrying values and their estimated fair values at that date 
at september   the carrying values of assets and liabilities related to v sper totaled million and million  respectively 
assuming the requisite government approvals are received and all conditions to close are satisfied  we anticipate providing approximately million to million in aggregate funding including the million of interim funding by the closing date to facilitate the embratel sale transaction 
we expect to recognize cumulative foreign currency translation losses  previously included in stockholders equity  as part of the gain or loss on a sale or other disposition of v sper 
we expect to record an approximate million to million loss if and when the transaction closes  including the cumulative foreign currency translation losses 
we may incur additional losses related to v sper if we are not successful in closing the sale transaction with embratel or  in that event  if we are unable to realize the estimated fair value of v sper s assets upon their sale to another party or other disposition or if we are unable to effect such a sale or other disposition of v sper and or its assets quickly

see note to the consolidated financial statements acquisitions for information about long term debt 
the fair values of bank loans and capital lease obligations will change as interest rates change

equity price market risk 
we hold marketable securities and derivative instruments subject to equity price risk which are accounted for under fas and fas the recorded values of marketable equity securities totaled million at september  as of september   one equity position constituted approximately of the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio 
the recorded value of derivative instruments subject to fas at september  was million 
we generally invest in technology companies and typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
these investments are held for purposes other 
table of contents than trading 
the portfolio s concentrations in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time  and changes in concentrations may affect the portfolio s price volatility 
during the last three years  many technology stocks experienced significant decreases in value  negatively affecting the fair values of our available for sale equity securities and derivative instruments 
a decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities  at september  would cause a corresponding decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities  or million 
our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of investments in private early stage companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods 
accordingly  we believe that our exposure to market risk from these investments is not material 
additionally  we do not anticipate any near term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in management s objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures 
the recorded values of these strategic investments totaled million at september  additional information regarding our strategic investments is provided in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results in this annual report 
foreign exchange market risk 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  consisting primarily of forward contracts and options 
derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
at september   no foreign currency forward contracts were outstanding 
see note to the consolidated financial statements the company and its significant accounting policies for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies 
financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investees which are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions 
as a result  we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows  as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments 
while we may hedge certain transactions with non united states customers  declines in currency values in certain regions may  if not reversed  adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risk related to our consolidation of the v sper operating companies 
we report our financial statements in us dollars 
the v sper operating companies account for the majority of their transactions in brazilian real  and their results are translated into us dollars during and at the end of the fiscal quarter 
in addition  the v sper operating companies capital lease commitments are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  a significant change in the value of the us dollar against the brazilian real could have a material effect on the v sper operating companies and on us 
a significant devaluation of the brazilian real occurred in the past and may occur again in the future 
a weakening of the us dollar relative to the brazilian real during fiscal would have resulted in a decrease in net income of approximately million for the year ended september  finance receivables and notes receivable from international carriers and customers that do not use the united states dollar as their functional currencies subject us to credit risk 
because our financing is us dollar denominated  any significant change in the value of the us dollar against the debtors functional currencies could result in an increase in the debtor s cash flow requirements and could thereby affect our ability to collect our receivables 
at september   finance and note receivables from international carriers and customers totaled million  net of allowances 
our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks
