requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by the company 
in addition  financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion to address  among other things  liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
the most significant estimates relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts  reserve for warranties  reserves for employee benefits  income taxes  depreciation of fixed assets and long lived assets  contingencies and litigation and the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements 
most of the company s it development centers  including a substantial majority of its employees are located in india 
as a result  the company may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations  including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions 
to date  the company has not engaged in any hedging transactions to mitigate its risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations 
additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  potentially adverse tax consequences  tariffs  quotas and other barriers 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
the company s services are entered into on either a time and materials or fixed price basis 
revenues related to time and material contracts are recognized as the service is performed 
revenues related to fixed price contracts that provide for application development services or that provide for a combination of application development and application management services are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting  under which the sales value of performance is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract s cost to date bears to the total estimated cost 
revenues related to fixed priced contracts that provided solely for application management services are recognized on a straight line basis or as services are rendered or transactions processed in accordance with contract terms 
expenses are recorded as incurred over the contract period 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus in eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus  which is effective for contracts entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   requires that a company evaluate all deliverables in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
that evaluation must be performed at the inception of the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered 
arrangement consideration should be then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
eitf indicates that the best evidence of fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
fair value evidence often consists of entity specific or vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
the company enters into contracts that could be considered arrangements with multiple deliverables 
these contracts are primarily long term fixed bid contracts that provide both application maintenance and application development services 
as indicated above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company accounts for such contracts using percentage of completion accounting 
the company is currently evaluating the prospective impact of eitf on the company s results of operations related to contracts entered into after june  fixed price contracts are cancelable subject to a specified notice period 
all services provided by the company through the date of cancellation are due and payable under the contract terms 
the company issues invoices related to fixed price contracts based upon achievement of milestones during a project or other contractual terms 
differences between the timing of billings  based upon contract milestones or other contractual terms  and the recognition of revenue  based upon the percentage of completion method of accounting  are recognized as either unbilled or deferred revenue 
estimates are subject to adjustment as a project progresses to reflect changes in expected completion costs 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known and any anticipated losses on contracts are recognized immediately 
a reserve for warranty provisions under such contracts  which generally exist for ninety days past contract completion  is estimated and accrued during the contract period 
revenues related to services performed without a signed agreement or work order are not recognized until there is evidence of an arrangement  such as when agreements or work orders are signed or payment is received  however the cost related to the performance of such work is recognized in the period the services are rendered 
such revenue is recognized when  and if  evidence of an arrangement is obtained 
foreign currency translation 
the assets and liabilities of the company s canadian and european subsidiaries are translated into us dollars from local currencies at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated from local currencies at average monthly exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity 
for the company s indian subsidiary cts india  the functional currency is the us dollar  since its sales are made primarily in the united states  the sales price is predominantly in us dollars and there is a high volume of intercompany transactions denominated in us dollars between cts india and its us affiliates 
non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates  while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates 
the resulting gain loss is included in other income 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer based upon market capitalization and other information  including the aging of the receivables 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized in the period such determination was made 
cognizant s indian subsidiary  cts india  is an export oriented company  which  under the indian income tax act of is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten years with respect to its export profits 
substantially all of the earnings of cts india are attributable to export profits and are therefore currently entitled to a exemption from indian income tax 
these tax holidays will begin to expire in and under current law will be completely phased out by march of prior to  it was management s intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from india to the united states  accordingly  cognizant has provided deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately million on all such undistributed earnings through december  during the first quarter of  cognizant made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in india and geographic expansion in europe and asia 
as a component of this strategy  cognizant intends to use and future indian earnings to expand operations outside of the united states instead of repatriating these earnings to the united states 
accordingly  effective january   pursuant to accounting principles bulletin  cognizant will no longer accrue taxes on the repatriation of earnings recognized in and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 
as of december   the amount of unrepatriated earnings upon which no provision for taxation has been recorded is approximately million 
if such earnings are repatriated in the future  or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested  cognizant will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings 
due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future  it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation 
this change in intent  as well as a change in the manner in which repatriated earnings are taxed in india  resulted in an estimated effective tax rate for the year ended december  of 
this rate compares to an effective tax rate for the year ended december  of 
effective april   the government of india passed various tax law changes which affected the way in which the company s earnings are taxed in india 
the tax exemption for export earnings was reduced from to  a surtax was imposed increasing the effective rate from to for income that is subject to tax  and the corporate level tax on the payment of dividends was replaced with a withholding tax on dividends 
cognizant s cash requirements could change over time  which could effectively force it to change its intent on repatriating indian earnings 
if cognizant s earnings are intended to be repatriated in the future  or are no longer reinvested outside the united states  cognizant will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than the effective rate in these increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on cognizant s business  results of operations and financial condition  as well as cash flows to fund such taxes 
in addition  cognizant may need to accelerate the payment of significant deferred taxes  which would have a significant impact on its cash position 
goodwill and other intangibles 
prior to  goodwill  which related to the acquisition of the former minority interest in the company s indian subsidiary  was amortized using the straight line basis over a period of seven years

goodwill and other intangible assets fas  the company is no longer amortizing its remaining goodwill balance  however  at each balance date  the company does evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually  or as circumstances warrant 
if such assets were determined to be impaired  it could have a material adverse effect on cognizant s business  results of operations and financial condition
