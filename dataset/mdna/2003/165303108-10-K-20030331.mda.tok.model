however  this was not enough to offset the reduced margins on the lower sales volumes 
the decline in margins was due to warmer temperatures  a reduction in sales to poultry customers and the continuation of competitive pressures in some of the markets the company serves on the peninsula 
the decline in sales to poultry customers comprised percent of the decline in margins 
the decreases in volume were exacerbated by the decline in wholesale prices over the course of declines in wholesale prices  which are generally good for the long term  negatively impact the company in the short term by devaluing its inventories and fixed price supply contracts 
during  the company wrote down inventory totaling  due to wholesale price declines 
increased competition also affected volumes sold in in recent years  several independent dealers entered the propane business with pricing strategies designed to acquire market share 
the company s position as a top distributor in several of the markets that it serves makes it particularly vulnerable to these tactics

critical accounting policies chesapeake s financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the accounting methods  assumptions and estimates used in critical accounting policies 
however  because most of chesapeake s businesses are regulated  the accounting methods used by chesapeake must comply with the requirements of the regulatory bodies  therefore  the choices are limited 
management believes that the following policies require significant estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies have been discussed with the audit committee of chesapeake 
regulatory assets and liabilities chesapeake records certain assets and liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
costs are deferred when there is a probable expectation that they will be recovered in future revenues as a result of the regulatory process 
at december  chesapeake had recorded regulatory assets of million  including million for underrecovered purchased gas costs and million for environmental costs 
there is also a liability of million for environmental costs 
if the company were required to terminate application of sfas no 
 all such deferred amounts would be recognized in the income statement 
this would result in a charge to earnings  net of applicable income taxes  that could be material 
goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  chesapeake no longer amortized goodwill during instead  goodwill was tested for impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   and again at the end of the year 
these tests are based on subjective measurements  including discounted cash flows of expected future operating results and market valuations of similar businesses 
those tests indicated that the goodwill associated with the water business was impaired and charges totaling million pre tax were recorded 
the remaining water goodwill balance was  at december  environmental as more fully described in note m to the financial statements  chesapeake is currently participating in the investigation  assessment or remediation of three former gas manufacturing plant sites 
amounts have been recorded as environmental liabilities and associated environmental regulatory assets based on estimates of future costs provided by independent consultants 
there is uncertainty in these amounts because the environmental protection agency epa or state authority may not have selected the final remediation methods 
additionally  there is uncertainty due to the outcome of legal remedies sought from other potentially responsible parties 
at december   chesapeake had recorded environmental regulatory assets of million and a liability for environmental costs of million 
propane wholesale marketing contracts chesapeake s propane wholesale marketing operation enters into forward and futures contracts that are considered derivatives under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in accordance with the pronouncement  open positions are marked to market prices at the end of each reporting period and unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the statement of income 
the contracts all mature within one year  and are almost exclusively for propane commodities with delivery points of mt 
belvieu  texas and hattiesburg  mississippi 
management estimates the market valuation based on reference to exchange traded futures prices  historical differentials and actual trading activity at the end of the reporting period 
at december   there was an unrealized gain of  compared to an unrealized loss of  at december  operating revenues revenues for the natural gas distribution operations of the company are based on rates approved by the various public service commissions 
the natural gas transmission operation revenues are based on rates approved by ferc 
customers base rates may not be changed without formal approval by these commissions 
however  the regulatory authorities have granted the company s regulated natural gas distribution operations the ability to negotiate rates with customers that have competitive alternatives using approved methodologies 
in addition  the natural gas transmission operations can negotiate rates above or below the ferc approved tariff rates 
with the exception of the company s florida division  the company recognizes revenues from meters read on a monthly cycle basis 
this practice results in unbilled and unrecorded revenue from the cycle date through the end of the month 
the florida division recognizes revenues based on services rendered and records an amount for gas delivered but not yet billed 
chesapeake s natural gas distribution operations each have a gas cost recovery mechanism that provides for the adjustment of rates charged to customers as gas costs fluctuate 
these amounts are collected or refunded through adjustments to rates in subsequent periods 
the company charges flexible rates to the natural gas distribution s industrial interruptible customers to make them competitive with alternative types of fuel 
based on pricing  these customers can choose natural gas or alternative types of supply 
neither the company nor the interruptible customer is contractually obligated to deliver or receive natural gas 
the propane distribution operation records revenues on either an as delivered or a metered basis depending on the customer type 
the propane marketing operation records trading activity net  on a mark to market basis for open contracts 
the advanced information services  water services and other segments record revenue in the period the products are delivered and or services are rendered 
regulatory activities the company s natural gas distribution operations are subject to regulation by the delaware  maryland and florida public service commissions 
the natural gas transmission operation is subject to regulation by the ferc 
on august   the delaware division filed a general rate increase application with the delaware public service commission psc 
interim rates  subject to refund  went into effect on october  the psc approved a settlement agreement for phase i of the rate increase application in april phase i should result in an increase in rates of approximately  per year 
phase ii of the filing was approved by the delaware psc in november it should result in an additional increase in rates of approximately  phase ii also reduces the company s sensitivity to weather by changing the minimum customer charge and the margin sharing arrangement for interruptible sales  off system sales and capacity release income 
in  the company requested and received approval from the delaware psc to annually adjust its interruptible margin sharing mechanism to address the level of recovery of fixed distribution costs from residential and small commercial heating customers 
the annual period ran from august to july during  the weather for the period ending august   was warmer than the threshold  resulting in a reduction in margin sharing 
this reduction resulted in a  increase in margin for this mechanism automatically terminated when the delaware division filed a general rate increase application on august  there was no impact on margins in due to this mechanism 
on october   eastern shore filed a rate change with the ferc pursuant to the requirements of the stipulation and agreement dated august  following settlement conferences held in may  the parties reached a settlement in principle on or about may   to resolve all issues related to its rate case 
the offer of settlement and the stipulation and agreement were finalized and filed with the ferc on august  the agreement provides that eastern shore s rates will be based on a cost of service of million per year 
cost savings estimated at  will be passed on to firm transportation customers 
initial comments supporting the settlement agreement were filed by the ferc staff and by eastern shore 
no adverse comments were filed 
the presiding judge certified the offer of settlement to the ferc as uncontested on august  on october   the ferc issued an order approving the offer of settlement and the stipulation and agreement 
settlement rates went into effect on december  during october  eastern shore filed for recovery of gas supply realignment costs associated with the implementation of ferc order no 
the costs totaled  including interest 
it is uncertain at this time when the ferc will consider this matter or the ultimate outcome 
on march   the florida division filed tariff revisions with the florida psc to complete the unbundling process by requiring all customers  including residential  to migrate to transportation service and authorized the florida division to exit the merchant function 
transportation services were already available to all nonresidential customers 
on november   the florida psc approved the company s request for the first phase of the unbundling process as a pilot program for a minimum two year period 
the company is implementing the program immediately and must submit an interim report for review by the florida psc after one year 
as a part of this pilot program  the company expects to submit several filings over the first six months of to address transition costs  the disposition of the unrecovered gas cost balances  the implementation of the operational balancing account and the level of base rates 
in january  the company filed a request for approval of a rate increase with the florida psc 
interim rates  subject to refund  went into effect in august in november  an order was issued approving the rate increase  which became effective in early december during the maryland general assembly legislative session  taxation of electric and gas utilities was changed by the passage of the electric and gas utility tax reform act tax act 
effective january   the tax act altered utility taxation to account for the restructuring of the electric and gas industries by either repealing and or amending the existing public service company franchise tax  corporate income tax and property tax 
prior to this tax act  the state of maryland allowed utilities a credit to their income tax liability for maryland gross receipts taxes paid during the year 
the modification eliminates the gross receipts tax credit 
the company requested and received approval from the maryland public service commission to increase its natural gas delivery service rates by  on an annual basis to recover the estimated impact of the tax act 
environmental matters the company continues to work with federal and state environmental agencies to assess the environmental impact and explore corrective action at four environmental sites see note m to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that future costs associated with these sites will be recoverable in rates or through sharing arrangements with  or contributions by  other responsible parties 
market risk market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
long term debt is subject to potential losses based on the change in interest rates 
the company s long term debt consists of first mortgage bonds  senior notes and convertible debentures see note h to the consolidated financial statements for annual maturities of consolidated long term debt 
all of chesapeake s long term debt is fixed rate debt and was not entered into for trading purposes 
the carrying value of the company s long term debt was million at december   as compared to a fair value of million  based mainly on current market prices or discounted cash flows using current rates for similar issues with similar terms and remaining maturities 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of financing through its issuance of fixed rate long term debt 
the company evaluates whether to refinance existing debt or permanently finance existing short term borrowing based in part on the fluctuation in interest rates 
the company s propane distribution business is exposed to market risk as a result of propane storage activities and entering into fixed price contracts for supply 
the company can store up to approximately four million gallons of propane including leased storage during the winter season to meet its customers peak requirements and to serve metered customers 
decreases in the wholesale price of propane may cause the value of stored propane to decline 
the propane marketing operation is a party to natural gas liquids ngl forward contracts  primarily propane contracts  with various third parties 
these contracts require that the propane marketing operation purchase or sell ngl at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of ngl to the company or the counter party or booking out the transaction booking out is a procedure for financially settling a contract in lieu of the physical delivery of energy 
the wholesale propane marketing operation also enters into futures contracts that are traded on the new york mercantile exchange 
in certain cases  the futures contracts are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the current market price of the futures contract and the original contract price 
the forward and futures contracts are entered into for trading and wholesale marketing purposes 
the propane marketing operation is subject to commodity price risk on its open positions to the extent that market prices for ngl deviate from fixed contract settlement amounts 
market risk associated with the trading of futures and forward contracts are monitored daily for compliance with chesapeake s risk management policy  which includes volumetric limits for open positions 
to manage exposures to changing market prices  open positions are marked up or down to market prices and reviewed by oversight officials on a daily basis 
additionally  the risk management committee reviews periodic reports on market and credit risk  approves any exceptions to the risk management policy within the limits established by the board of directors and authorizes the use of any new types of contracts

all contracts expired in the company s natural gas distribution operations have entered into agreements with natural gas suppliers to purchase natural gas for resale to their customers 
purchases under these contracts are considered normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
and are not marked to market 
competition the company s natural gas operations compete with other forms of energy including electricity  oil and propane 
the principal competitive factors are price  and to a lesser extent  accessibility 
the company s natural gas distribution operations have several large volume industrial customers that have the capacity to use fuel oil as an alternative to natural gas 
when oil prices decline  these interruptible customers convert to oil to satisfy their fuel requirements 
lower levels in interruptible sales occur when oil prices are lower relative to the price of natural gas 
oil prices  as well as the prices of electricity and other fuels are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons  therefore  future competitive conditions are not predictable 
to address this uncertainty  the company uses flexible pricing arrangements on both the supply and sales side of its business to maximize sales volumes 
as a result of the transmission business conversion to open access  this business has shifted from providing competitive sales service to providing transportation and contract storage services 
the company s natural gas distribution operations located in maryland  delaware and florida offer transportation services to certain industrial customers 
in  the florida operation extended transportation service to commercial customers and  in  to residential customers 
with transportation service now available on the company s distribution systems  the company is competing with third party suppliers to sell gas to industrial customers 
the company s competitors include the interstate transmission company if the distribution customer is located close enough to the transmission company s pipeline to make a connection economically feasible 
the customers at risk are usually large volume commercial and industrial customers with the financial resources and capability to bypass the distribution operations in this manner 
in certain situations  the distribution operations may adjust services and rates for these customers to retain their business 
the company expects to continue to expand the availability of transportation service to additional classes of distribution customers in the future 
the company established a natural gas sales and supply operation in florida in to compete for customers eligible for transportation services 
the company s propane distribution operations compete with several other propane distributors in their service territories  primarily on the basis of service and price 
competitors include several large national propane distribution companies  as well as an increasing number of local suppliers 
some of these competitors have pricing strategies designed to acquire market share 
the company s advanced information services segment faces competition from a number of competitors  some of which have greater resources available to them than those of the company 
this segment competes on the basis of technological expertise  reputation and price 
the water services segment faces competition from a variety of national and local suppliers of water conditioning and treatment services and bottled water 
inflation inflation affects the cost of labor  products and services required for operation  maintenance and capital improvements 
while the impact of inflation has remained low in recent years  natural gas and propane prices are subject to rapid fluctuations 
fluctuations in natural gas prices are passed on to customers through the gas cost recovery mechanism in the company s tariffs 
to help cope with the effects of inflation on its capital investments and returns  the company seeks rate relief from regulatory commissions for regulated operations while monitoring the returns of its unregulated business operations 
to compensate for fluctuations in propane gas prices  chesapeake adjusts its propane selling prices to the extent allowed by the market
