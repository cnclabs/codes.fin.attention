critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the company s assets and liabilities as well as recognition of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and judgments are based on the company s historical experience  actuarial assumptions and its understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical  as these policies are important to the presentation of the company s financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management 
management has identified the allowance for doubtful accounts associated with trade accounts receivable  the liability for both unpaid and unreported medical and workers compensation claims  and the liability for pension and postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations as critical accounting policies as a result of the judgment involved in the use of estimates 
the company evaluates its allowance for doubtful trade accounts receivable based on customers credit history  payment trends and other economic factors to the extent available 
it is possible that reported results could be different based upon changes in economic conditions that could impact creditors ability to pay 
the company evaluates its liability for unpaid and unreported medical and workers compensation claims based on historical payment trends and administration costs 
the company uses actuarial assumptions to calculate estimated future claim costs based on historical trends 
reported results could be different if historical trends differ from actual payment results 
the company evaluates its liability for pension and postretirement and postemployment benefit plans based upon estimates and actuarial assumptions of future plan service costs  future interest costs on projected benefit obligations  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates  expected investment returns on plan assets  asset allocation assumptions of plan assets  and other factors

new accounting pronouncements in july the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method 
the statement further requires separate recognition of intangible assets that meet certain criteria 
the statement applies to all business combinations initiated after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position or liquidity of the company 
in the company adopted sfas no 
 which requires that an intangible asset that is acquired shall be initially recognized and measured based on its fair value 
the statement also provides that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets should not be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to their carrying amount 
sfas no 
 among other things  eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain identified intangible assets 
the company tests intangible assets  including goodwill  that are not subject to amortization for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired  using a two step impairment assessment 
the first step of the impairment test identifies potential impairment and compares the fair value with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the company evaluates impairment at each of its st 
louis  pni  and tucson reporting units 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the company conducted the first step of impairment tests as of the beginning of its fiscal year 
the company assessed the fair value by considering each reporting unit s expected future cash flows  recent purchase prices paid for entities within its industry  and the company s market capitalization 
the company s discounted cash flow evaluation utilizes a discount rate that corresponds to the company s weighted average cost of capital 
given consideration of these factors  the company concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying amounts of its net assets and  accordingly  no impairment loss was recognized 
an annual impairment test was subsequently performed and indicated the fair value exceeded the carrying amount of goodwill 
subsequent impairments  if any  would be classified as an operating expense 
upon adoption of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary raw material used in the company s operations is newsprint  representing percent to percent of operating expenses over the last five years 
for  the company consumed approximately  metric tonnes of newsprint  including its percent share related to the operations of tni partners 
based on the company s current level of newspaper operations  expected annual newsprint consumption for is estimated to be in the range of  metric tonnes 
historically  newsprint has been subject to significant price fluctuations from year to year  unrelated in many cases to general economic conditions 
in the last five years  the company s average annual cost per metric tonne of newsprint has varied from its peak price by approximately percent 
for every one dollar change in the company s average annual cost per metric tonne of newsprint  pre tax income would change by approximately  assuming annual newsprint consumption of  metric tonnes 
the company attempts to obtain the best price available by combining item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued newsprint purchases for its different newspaper locations with those of other newspaper companies 
the company considers its relationship with newsprint producers to be good 
the company has not entered into derivative contracts for newsprint 
at december   the company had million of outstanding debt pursuant to the loan 
the loan bears interest at a fixed annual rate of percent 
consequently  if held to maturity  the loan will not expose the company to market risks associated with general fluctuations in interest rates 
at december   the company was a party to an interest rate swap contract to convert a portion of the company s fixed rate debt to a variable rate 
the interest rate swap has a million notional amount and matures on april  under the terms of the agreement  the company pays interest at a variable rate based upon libor plus percent and receives interest at a fixed rate of percent 
the floating interest rate re prices semiannually 
the impact of the swap results in approximately percent of the company s long term debt being subject to variable interest rates 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap represented an unrealized gain of million  which is offset by an unrealized loss of million on the related portion of the company s long term debt 
changes in market interest rates may cause the company to incur higher net interest expense 
for example  for every percent increase in variable interest rates beyond percent  the company would incur approximately million in additional annual interest expense
