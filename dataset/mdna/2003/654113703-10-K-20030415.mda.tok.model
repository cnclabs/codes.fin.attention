item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the pro forma financial data included elsewhere in this prospectus 
overview we provide portfolio management software for large enterprises 
our principal customers within these enterprises are information technology departments  new product development groups and consulting organizations 
our software provides management and governance of projects  programs and portfolios for these customers  enabling them to achieve control and predictability in their key initiatives 
our software is based on a web services architecture and offers a broad range of functionality including project management  resource management  portfolio management  project costing and financial planning  as well as specific project based methodologies such as six sigma 

table of contents critical accounting policies  methods and estimates accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets and restructuring reserves for vacated leased facilities 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue principally from licenses of our products  maintenance and support  and delivery of implementation services 
we offer our products primarily through our direct sales force 
in certain international markets  we also offer our products indirectly through channel partners 
revenue from license fees is recognized in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  which permits revenue recognition when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred and no significant obligations of ours with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
if there are sales to channel partners  they are recognized upon sell through to the end user customer 
we define each of the four criteria above as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
our customary practice is to have a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers who have previously negotiated a license agreement with us 
delivery has occurred 
our software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
delivery is deemed to have occurred upon meeting one of the following criteria as set forth in the revenue contract the shipment or electronic delivery of the product  notification of receipt of the product by the customer or notification by the customer of acceptance 
if undelivered products or services exist in an arrangement that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product  revenue is recognized when these products or services are delivered 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
we negotiate the fees for our products at the outset of an arrangement 
in these arrangements  the majority of the licenses are perpetual and related fees are nonrefundable 
the fees are generally due within six months or less 
we consider fees relating to arrangements with payment terms extending beyond six months not to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is evaluated on a customer by customer basis 
a customer s purchase order or waiver of purchase order is generally required with each arrangement 
where appropriate  new customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial position eg cash position and credit rating and their ability to pay  and existing customers are subject to a review of payment histories 
if collectibility is not considered probable at the outset of an arrangement in accordance with our credit review process  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
revenue from multiple element software arrangements is recognized using the residual value method 
the determination of the fair value of maintenance and support and implementation services is based on the objective evidence of the fair value of each element that is specific to us 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the vsoe for each element is established when the same element is sold separately 
we have analyzed and determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance and support services and implementation services components of our perpetual license arrangements 
vsoe for maintenance and 
table of contents support is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates for this element 
we sell our implementation services separately and have established vsoe on that basis 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from licenses is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop our software products are fully functional upon delivery and implementation and do not require significant modifications 
the customer may implement using their own resources or obtain the services of other implementation service organizations to provide these services 
therefore  our implementation services are not considered essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement 
the revenue allocable to the implementation services is generally recognized as services are performed 
maintenance and support revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual service period  which is typically one year 
we have never engaged in a transaction in which we provided product licenses or services to a customer in exchange for an equity interest 
we recognized no revenue under any type of reciprocal arrangements in fiscal or in fiscal revenue recognized under reciprocal arrangements was million in the year ended january   of which approximately  involved nonmonetary exchanges 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
deferred revenue generally results from the following maintenance and support  implementation services not yet rendered for which we have been paid  amounts billed to customers with extended payment terms  which amounts are not yet due  and transactions in which one of the four revenue recognition criteria has not been met 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded net of allowances for doubtful accounts and totaled million and million as of january  and  respectively 
the allowances for doubtful accounts were million and million as of january  and  respectively 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts after considering the amount of the aged accounts receivable  the age of each invoice  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review any invoice greater than days past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors discussed above 
in addition  we maintain a reserve for all invoices by applying a percentage to aging categories based on historical loss experience 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances such as our customers financial positions may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
impairment assessment we evaluate our long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the estimate of fair value of an asset considers prices for similar assets and the results of valuation techniques to the extent available under the circumstances 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
there were no asset impairment and other charges in fiscal except for an impairment charge of a strategic equity investment made in april we have regularly performed an impairment assessment of this  investment 
in performing an impairment assessment  we consider the private company s current solvency  future access to capital and recent equity transactions 
based on an analysis of these factors in fiscal 
table of contents  we determined that the investment impairment was other than temporary 
the carrying value of our strategic equity investment was zero at january  asset impairment and other charges in fiscal were as follows in the first quarter of fiscal  we performed an impairment assessment of our goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions of legal anywhere  bsource 
com  monkeys and alyanza software due to a change in our product plan related to certain acquired technologies 
this assessment was based on the expected future cash flows from goodwill and intangible assets over their remaining useful lives 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded million in asset impairment charges 
this amount included million to write down the net book value of certain goodwill and other intangible assets from our acquisitions of legal anywhere  bsource  monkeys and alyanza to zero except for the carrying value of legal anywhere s goodwill and customer lists  which was reduced to their estimated fair value of million 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we performed an additional impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions of abt  proamics and legal anywhere 
this assessment was performed primarily due to a significant decline in our stock price  which resulted in the net book value of our assets significantly exceeding our market capitalization 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded million in asset impairment charges in the second quarter of fiscal which reduced the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets related to our acquisitions of abt  proamics and legal anywhere to zero 
the estimate of the fair value was based on the estimated future discounted cash flows for the remaining life of the goodwill and other intangible assets with a discount rate of and an estimated terminal value 
the assumptions supporting the estimated cash flows  including the discount rate and an estimated terminal value  reflected management s best estimates 
the discount rate was based upon the weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies 
in fiscal  we recorded million in asset impairment charges  consisting of million relating to goodwill and other intangible assets  million in accelerated depreciation for internally used software and  to write off fixed assets that we no longer utilized 
restructuring reserves for vacated leased facilities we have recorded restructuring charges in connection with vacating certain leased facilities pursuant to our restructuring program 
costs associated with vacated leased facilities include remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees  offset by estimated sublease income 
estimated sublease income is determined by taking into consideration the type and condition of the subject property  information regarding the local commercial real estate market and expectations about time to obtain a sublessee provided by local commercial real estate brokerages 
we regularly review these estimates and to the extent that these estimates change due to changes in market conditions  the ultimate restructuring expenses for vacated leases could vary by material amounts 
for example  we recorded million in net lease commitment costs on vacated leases in fiscal related to restructuring activities in fiscal primarily due to adjustments to estimated future sublease income for certain facilities vacated in fiscal future lease payments  net of estimated sublease income  relating to facilities that we vacated or terminated but had not yet paid as of january  pursuant to our restructuring program  amounted to million   million   and million for the twelve months ending january     and  respectively  and million thereafter 
the million in payments mentioned above for the twelve months ended january  for leases we have either vacated or terminated but had not yet paid as of january  included the final million cash payment related to the termination of a major lease in redwood city  california 
this million was paid in february private placement of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in february  we entered into a common stock and warrant purchase agreement with various investors led by walden vc  providing for the issuance of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of per share in a connection with a private placement 
the warrants have an exercise price of

reverse stock split on november   we effected a one for ten reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock 
all information regarding common stock  stock options  warrants and loss per share amounts in this annual report on form k has been restated to reflect the reverse stock split 

table of contents repricing of stock options on november   our board of directors  acting pursuant to existing terms of our stock option plans  approved the repricing of approximately  outstanding stock options with exercise prices above 
the exercise prices of all such stock options were repriced to  which was the fair market value of our stock on november  there were no changes to the vesting schedules of the repriced options 
options held by our former chief executive officer  former executive vice president of strategy and planning  board of directors and non employees were not repriced 
we are accounting for the repriced options using variable accounting whereby the aggregate intrinsic value of the repriced options is continuously remeasured and amortized to stock based compensation expense over the vesting periods 
based on the stock price as of january   we recorded million in recovery of stock based compensation recognized in fiscal relating to these repriced stock options  offset by million in other stock based compensation in fiscal as of january   deferred stock based compensation relating to these repriced options was zero  reflecting the intrinsic value of unexercised repriced options as of january  to the extent that our stock price increases above in future periods  we will need to record additional stock based compensation expense 
in october  we cancelled options to purchase  shares of common stock held by our chief executive officer and granted him options to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of  which was the closing price of our common stock on the grant date 
as a result  based on the closing price of our common stock of on january   we recorded  in stock based compensation in fiscal to the extent that our stock price increases above in future periods  we will need to record additional stock based compensation expense 
on april   we announced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees 
under the program  our employees will be given the opportunity to exchange outstanding stock options previously granted to them with an exercise price greater than or equal to per share for a new option exercisable for shares for each share subject to the tendered options  to be granted at a future date  at least six months and a day from the cancellation date 
the exercise price of these new stock options will be equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
on the grant date  the new stock options will be vested as to the number of stock options that would have been vested on such date had the old stock options not been tendered plus the number of shares that would have been vested had the old option been exercisable for more shares 
our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and members of the board of directors are not eligible to participate in the program 
the exchange program is not expected to result in any additional compensation charges or variable plan accounting 
to the extent that our employees exchange outstanding stock options that were repriced on november   our stock based compensation related to such repriced options will be reduced or eliminated  but no assurance can be given that employees will participate in the option exchange program 
pro forma financial results we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain pro forma financial information in the quarterly and annual financial results press release and investor conference call 
this pro forma financial information excludes certain non cash and special charges  consisting primarily of stock based compensation  restructuring and other charges  impairment charges and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the us gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k 
the investors should also read the portions of our quarterly and annual financial results press releases which compare us gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results  and include a reconciliation of the us gaap and pro forma financial information

in fiscal  we terminated a lease for a significant facility in redwood city  california 
we entered into the lease for this facility in march the lease term commenced upon possession of the facility in august and had a term of years 
prior to its termination  the agreement required us to hold a letter of credit drawable by the lessor totaling approximately million and million in security deposits 
we vacated this facility in july and terminated the lease on october  the total termination costs amounted to million  offset by million for the reversal of previously recorded deferred rent 
our future commitments under the redwood city lease prior to the termination were approximately million 
as of february  we had paid all termination costs related to the lease 
we currently have a term loan for million from a financial institution 
we entered into this loan in september the term loan is secured by our tangible and intangible assets  accrues interest at per annum and matures on february  we are required to make quarterly payments of principal and interest on a five year amortization schedule 
we repaid  plus interest in december and  plus interest in march on the maturity date  the remaining principal balance of million is due 
this term loan has certain financial covenants  including covenants relating to cash on hand  revenue and operating expenses 
in january  we agreed with the financial institution that we would not repay a portion of the term loan with the proceeds of a legal settlement we received in december as of january   we were not in compliance with a covenant relating to revenue 
we received a waiver for such covenant in february future minimum lease and termination payments under operating leases and payments under bank borrowings are as follows as of january  in thousands operating bank year ended january  leases borrowings total thereafter total payments lease payments above  net of estimated sublease income  relating to facilities that we have either vacated or terminated pursuant to our restructuring program  amounted to million   million   and million for the twelve months ended january     and  respectively  and million thereafter

this million was paid in february we have working capital of million as of january  we believe that cash from operations and existing cash  including approximately million in net proceeds from a private placement we completed in 
table of contents the first quarter of fiscal  will be sufficient to meet our current expectations for working capital and expense requirements for at least the next twelve months based on  among other things  our current revenue and expense projections 
however  we may require additional financing in the future 
if we were unable to raise capital in the event of ongoing losses and depletion of our available cash resources  the absence of funding would have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we issue additional equity securities  stockholders will experience additional dilution and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the then existing holders of our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of retirement obligations be recognized as a liability when they are incurred and that the associated retirement costs be capitalized as a long term asset and expensed over its useful life 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections

sfas no 
also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured at fair value only when the liability is initially incurred 
sfas no 
will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
provides expanded accounting guidance surrounding liability recognition and disclosure requirements related to guarantees  as defined by this interpretation 
we had no existing guarantees as of january   and we do not expect that the adoption of fin no 
will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
indemnification and warranty provisions within our customer license and service agreements are generally consistent with those prevalent in our industry 
the duration of our product warranties generally does not exceed days following delivery of our products 
we have not incurred significant obligations under customer indemnification or warranty provision historically and do not expect to incur significant obligations in the future 
accordingly  we do not maintain accruals for potential customer indemnification or warranty related obligations 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
expands upon existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial 
table of contents statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin no 
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of fin no 
on our financial statements and related disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and market our products in north america and europe and to a lesser degree in asia 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
approximately of our total revenue was made in currencies other than us dollars in fiscal although we are exposed to the general foreign currency exchange rate risk described above  we do not expect any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to movements in any specific foreign currency 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses of our european subsidiaries 
we will continue to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt obligations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposits  certificates of deposits and money market accounts that mature in three months or less 
due to the short term nature of our cash and cash equivalents  we believe that there is no material market or interest rate risk exposure on our cash and cash equivalents 
due to the fixed interest rate of our indebtedness  a decrease in interest rate would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
