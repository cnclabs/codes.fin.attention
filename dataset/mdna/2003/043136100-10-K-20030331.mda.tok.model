overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets products based on our patented coblation technology 
our products allow surgeons to operate with increased precision and accuracy  limiting damage to surrounding tissue thereby reducing pain and speeding recovery for the patient 
our products operate at lower temperatures than traditional electrosurgical or laser surgery tools and enable surgeons to ablate  shrink  sculpt  cut  or aspirate soft tissue surgery procedures with one multi purpose surgical system 
we have organized our marketing and sales efforts into business units based on product markets 
these business units are comprised of the following arthroscopy shoulder and knee arthroscopic products  ent to include ear  nose  throat and the visage cosmetic products  arthrocare spine to include spinal and neuro surgery products and coblation technology to include gynecology  urology  laparoscopic  general surgical and cardiology products 
coblation technology is applicable across many soft tissue surgical markets 
our systems are used to perform many types of arthroscopic surgery 
our strategy includes applying our patented coblation technology to a broad range of other soft tissue markets  including spinal surgery  neurosurgery  cosmetic surgery  ent surgery  general surgery  gynecology  urology and various cardiology applications 
in april  we announced that we had entered the cosmetic surgery market and formed a business unit called visage to commercialize coblation technology in this field 
in early  we entered into a license and distribution agreement with collagen aesthetics  inc  which was subsequently purchased by inamed corporation 
under this agreement  inamed corporation acquired exclusive  worldwide  marketing right for our cosmetic surgery line of products for the dermatology and cosmetic surgery markets 
in march  we terminated this contract  alleging breach by inamed of certain terms of the contract 
we signed a settlement agreement with inamed mutually releasing all claims against each other in in april  we began marketing and selling our cosmetic surgery product line through a network of distributors and direct sales representatives 
in may  we announced that we had entered the ear  nose and throat market and had formed a business unit called entec to commercialize coblation technology in this field 
in early  we formed a business unit  angiocare  for the purpose of further developing and commercializing our technology in specific applications in the field of cardiology 
as part of those efforts  in february  we entered into a license agreement under which boston scientific corporation would help develop  obtain regulatory approval for and market products based on coblation technology for myocardial revascularization procedures 
in we terminated this agreement and now retain all rights to coblation technology in this field 
in september  we announced that we had entered the spinal surgery market 
in february  we announced that we were expanding our marketing efforts for our spinal surgery system to specifically address selected applications in neurosurgery 
we are marketing and selling our spinal surgery products through a network of independent distributors and direct sales representatives supported by regional managers worldwide 
we have received k clearance to market our arthroscopic system for use in arthroscopic surgery of the knee  shoulder  ankle  elbow  wrist and hip  and our arthroscopy system is ce marked for use in arthroscopic surgery 
our spinal surgery system is ce marked and we have received k clearance in the united states to market this system for spinal surgery and neurosurgery 
our ent surgery system has received k clearance in the united states and is ce marked for general head  neck and oral surgical procedures  including tonsillectomy  adenoidectomy  snoring and the treatment of hypertrophic nasal turbinates and submucosal tissue channeling and shrinkage 
our cosmetic surgery system is ce marked for general dermatology and skin resurfacing for the purpose of wrinkle reduction procedures and we have received k clearance for use of our cosmetic surgery system in general dermatology procedures and for skin resurfacing for the purpose of wrinkle reduction in the united states 
we have received k clearance to market coblation technology for general surgery  gynecology and urology 
in december  we introduced our arthroscopy system commercially in the united states and have derived a significant portion of our sales from this system 
our strategy includes placing controller units  at substantial discounts  placing controllers at customer sites at no cost or in return for a commitment to purchase a minimum number of surgical wands  to generate future disposable product revenue 
our strategy also includes applying our patented coblation technology to a range of other soft tissue surgical markets including the products we have introduced in the fields of spinal surgery  neurosurgery  gynecology  urology  cosmetic surgery  ear  nose and throat surgery  cardiology and general surgery 
we have received k clearance for use of our technology in several fields 
we cannot be sure that any of our clinical studies in other fields will lead to k applications or that the applications will be cleared by the fda on a timely basis  if at all 
in addition  we cannot be sure that the products  if cleared for marketing  will ever achieve commercial acceptance 
results of operations arthrocare corporation statements of operation year ended december  revenues product sales royalties  fees and other total revenues cost of product sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income and other  net income before income tax provision income tax provision benefit income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle cumulative effect on prior years of application of sab revenue recognition in financial statements net income reclassifications on january  we implemented eitf  which relates to the consideration from a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s product which stipulates that commissions we pay to stocking distributors be reflected as a reduction of revenues in the statement of income 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to this new standard 
this reclassification resulted in a million decrease in fiscal revenues and a million decrease in fiscal revenues 
these revenue reductions were offset by decreases in sales and marketing expenses  thereby having no impact on the company s previously reported net income 
revenues total revenues for fiscal were million compared to million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  total revenues included million due to atlantech medical devices  ltd 
and atlantech gmbh  collectively referred to as atlantech  which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal product sales for were million  an increase of  from million for product sales in were higher than the million in several years ago  arthrocare began aggressively transitioning its distribution channel away from stocking distributors to a more direct sales model 
the execution of this strategy is now substantially complete 
as a result  the company recorded million in revenue reduction adjustments and charges in due to termination of stocking distributor agreements 
the company shipped approximately  disposable devices in fiscal compared to approximately  units in fiscal and approximately  units in fiscal all commercial business units posted sales increases in compared to the company s arthroscopy business unit contributed million in net product sales in as compared to million in and million in the company s ear  nose and throat ent business unit contributed million in net product sales in as compared to million in and million in the company s spinal surgery arthrocare spine business unit contributed million in net product sales in as compared to million in and million in the company s coblation technologies business unit contributed million in net product sales in as compared to million in and million in international sales grew by million during fiscal the increase in direct sales presence  which was begun in  continued to have a positive effect on sales in  as did the execution of our strategic plan to build market share through continued promotional programs of controller placements  commercialization of our technology in fields outside of arthroscopy and introduction of new products designed to address surgical procedures that have traditionally been difficult to perform 
overall  disposable devices are consistently sold at or near list price  except for sales to international distributors and marketing partners  which are sold at discounted prices 
we expect these discounts to continue in the future 
for fiscal years  and  disposable device sales comprised approximately  and  respectively  of our product sales 
we anticipate that disposable device sales will remain the primary component of our product sales in the near future 
international product sales were million  or of total product sales  in as compared to million  or of total product sales  in and million  or of total product sales  in based upon the estimated number of arthroscopic procedures performed each year  we believe that knee procedures represent the largest segment of the arthroscopic market  while shoulder procedures represent the fastest growing segment 
to achieve increasing disposable device sales in arthroscopy over time  we believe we must continue to penetrate the market in knee procedures  expand physicians education with respect to coblation technology  and continue to work on new product development efforts specifically for knee applications 
we believe that  in our seven years of product shipments  we have penetrated to of the hospitals that perform arthroscopic procedures in the united states 
we believe that approximately of our arthroscopy product sales are being generated by the sale of disposables for use in knee procedures 
royalties  fees  and other revenues decreased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal during fiscal royalties  fees  and other revenues was million 
royalties  fees  and other revenues decreased in primarily due to the cancellation of agreements in with distribution partners resulting in recognition of million in fees that previously had been deferred 
during fiscal year  we adopted sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab and changed our method of accounting for license fees and milestones from business partners to recognize such revenues over the term of the associated agreement unless the fee or milestones is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
amounts received prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
the cumulative effect of the change of million in fiscal was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  retroactive to january  the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle included license fee revenues and deferred revenues that would be recognized over the lives of the associated agreements 
during fiscal year  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of royalties  fees and other revenues in accordance with our agreement with ethicon  inc in february  we entered into a license agreement under which boston scientific corporation was granted an exclusive right to develop and market products based on coblation technology for myocardial revascularization procedures 
boston scientific corporation pays license fees to us upon achievement of designated milestones and royalties on sales of resulting products  if any 
during fiscal we recognized million of such payments as license fees and royalties 
in january  we entered into a license and distribution agreement with inamed corporation  which was expanded in february  whereby inamed corporation acquired exclusive  worldwide  marketing rights for our patented coblation technology in the cosmetic surgery market 
under the terms of the agreement  inamed corporation paid us license fees based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on sales of product to end users 
during fiscal we recognized million of these payments as royalties  fees  and other revenues 
cost of product sales cost of product sales for fiscal was million  or of product sales  compared with million  or of product sales  for fiscal during fiscal  cost of product sales was million  or of product sales 
the million increase in cost of product sales for fiscal over fiscal resulted from the sale of  more disposable units which led to an approximate million increase in costs  million increase in controller placement costs and million in atlantech cost of sales 
the million increase for fiscal over fiscal resulted from the sale of  more disposable units  partially offset by a lower number of controllers sold as part of the expansion of our controller placement program 
in addition  we continued controller placements under a program whereby we maintain ownership of the controller  which resulted in the cost being capitalized and amortized into cost of sales over future periods rather than expensing the entire cost at the time of placement 
during the second half of fiscal  the company significantly lowered its manufacturing costs by relocating the majority of its production to a new facility in costa rica 
this required the company to revalue its existing inventory downward by million to bring it in line with the new  lower manufacturing cost structure 
the company closed the acquisition of atlantech during fiscal which resulted in million of incremental cost of sales relating to purchase price adjustments to inventory as acquired inventory must be valued to yield a distributors as opposed to a manufacturers profit margin 
the increase in gross product margin as a percentage of product sales to in fiscal from in fiscal is mainly attributable to increased average selling prices of disposable devices  increased manufacturing efficiency and increased production volume which was partially offset by the increased controller placement costs and the lower gross margin on atlantech sales 
the increase in gross product margin as a percentage of product sales in as compared to is mainly attributable to an increase in average selling prices of disposable devices  increased manufacturing efficiency and increased production volume 
in fiscal  the gross product margin as a percentage of product sales was 
as planned  the company s new costa rica facility continued shipping sub assemblies to the sunnyvale facility in fiscal and is expected to contribute to gross margin improvements in the future 
operating expenses research and development expense increased to million in fiscal  or of product sales  from million in fiscal  or of product sales  and from million  or of product sales in fiscal in  atlantech had no research and development expense 
the million and million increases in spending between fiscal years and and between and  respectively  are attributed primarily to continued development of new products in our currently commercialized markets and continued maintenance and development of our patent position 
compensation and related expenses increased by million in fiscal due to increasing headcount and increased by million in fiscal due to increasing headcount to support research and development efforts 
development prototype materials increased by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
facility and information system costs increased million in fiscal year in conjunction with expanding our infrastructure 
other expenses increased by million in fiscal in support of development activities 
in fiscal year  other expenses decreased by million mainly due to a decrease in the research and development efforts conducted on behalf of business partners and a reduction of expenses incurred by the company for non employee stock options 
we believe that investment in our coblation technology is essential for us to maintain our competitive position 
we expect to increase the dollar amount of research and development expenses through continued expenditures on new product development  regulatory affairs  clinical studies and patents  but anticipate expenses to decrease slightly as a percentage of product sales 
sales and marketing expense increased to million  or of product sales  in fiscal year  from million  or of product sales  in fiscal year  and from million  or of product sales  in fiscal year in fiscal  sales and marketing expense included million due to atlantech 
increased expenses associated with hiring a direct sales force for certain of our business and expenses with canceling distributors accounted for million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
commission expense increased million and million in fiscal and  respectively  as a result of increased sales 
increased sales and marketing activity in our businesses other than arthroscopy and our expanded international operations resulted in an increase of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
we anticipate that sales and marketing spending will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of expansion of our distribution capabilities to address the spinal surgery  ear  nose and throat and cosmetic surgical markets  higher dealer commissions from increased sales  the additional cost of penetrating international markets  higher promotional  demonstration and sample expenses  and additional investments in the sales  marketing and support staff necessary to market products and to commercialize future products 
we have entered into a strategic relationship with the gynecare division of ethicon  inc to commercialize coblation based products for laparoscopic and open surgical procedures for gynecological applications 
we have also entered into a strategic relationship with acmi  under which acmi will market and sell our products for urologic indications  including transurethral resection of the prostrate turp 
general and administrative expense increased to million  or of product sales  in fiscal year  from million  or of product sales  in fiscal year and from million  or of product sales in fiscal year in  general and administrative expense included million due to atlantech 
the million increase in fiscal general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a million increase in staffing and salaries  a million increase in the cost of general and patent related legal services and approximately million increase due to increases in business development activities  insurance and other expenditures necessary to expand our corporate infrastructure 
the million increase in fiscal general and administrative expenses was attributable to a million increase in staffing and salaries  increases in the cost of general and patent related legal services  business development activities  insurance and international accounting and tax related expenditures necessary to expand our corporate infrastructure 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of product sales  but will increase in dollar amounts as we incur additional legal expenses and continue business development activities 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  decreased to million in fiscal from million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the million decrease in interest and other income in fiscal was primarily due to a million decrease in interest income as a result of a decrease in the amount of cash and investment balance resulting from our investing and financing activities  declining interest rates throughout  and a million gain on the sale of an investment in fiscal as opposed to a gain of million in in fiscal  the million increase in interest and other income included a million gain on the sale of an investment which was partially offset by a reduction of million in interest earned as a result of declining interest rates throughout and a lower cash and investment balance resulting from our investing and financing activities 
at the end of fiscal  we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities as compared to million at the end of fiscal and to million at the end of fiscal income tax provision benefit the provision benefit for income taxes was million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year and million in fiscal year the fiscal effective rate was as compared to in fiscal the primary difference between and relates to the release of the valuation allowance in fiscal historically  we have established deferred tax assets arising from federal net operating loss carryforwards  federal tax credit carryforwards as well as from other timing differences 
these deferred tax assets have been offset in total by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets 
during fiscal  we decreased the valuation allowance and recognized a tax benefit relating to the recognition of deferred tax assets of million 
the decrease in the valuation allowance and the resulting recognition of a deferred tax benefit in the year was based on management s belief that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
liquidity and capital resources at the end of fiscal  we had million in working capital compared to million at the end of fiscal our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term available for sale securities 
the cash equivalents are highly liquid with original maturities of ninety days or less 
cash generated by operating activities was million for fiscal which was mainly attributable to net income before depreciation of million  and changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million which was partially offset by changes in inventory of million 
accounts receivable  net of allowances  decreased slightly to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal and million at the end of fiscal the decrease in accounts receivable in fiscal was due to significant increase in sales that was offset by an improvement in the collection times 
the increase in accounts receivable in fiscal was due to the increase in sales and the impact of longer payment terms relating primarily to increasing sales to international customers 
inventories increased to million at the end of fiscal compared to million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in inventory was in order to support anticipated increasing product sales activity  lower than expected sales at the end of fiscal and  safety stock for our move of the manufacturing operations into our new facility in costa rica in early and the introduction levels required to grow and support sales volume increases 
we expect future inventory levels to increase in absolute dollar value in order to support sales volume increases  to provide safety stock and support our expansion into additional markets 
cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million provided in fiscal and million used in fiscal cash was used in investing activities in fiscal because the sales of available for sale securities was more than offset by the purchases of other available for sale securities  the acquisition of atlantech  and property and equipment additions 
in fiscal  cash was provided by investing activities because the sales of available for sale securities was only partially offset by the purchases of other available for sale securities and property and equipment 
cash was provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily due to the sales of available for sale securities 
purchases of property and equipment increased to million for fiscal year compared to million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to the million capitalization of controllers placed under various promotional programs  acquisition of land and building in costa rica for million  an increase in computer equipment and software for million and leasehold improvements of million in our new headquarters 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal year  compared to cash used of million and cash provided of million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in both fiscal and was primarily due to the purchase of treasury stock and the partial offset by the proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to the proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations have on future cash flows in thousands non cancelable lease obligations  less than year non cancelable lease obligations  years non cancelable lease obligations  years non cancelable lease obligations  greater than years we plan to finance our future operating and capital needs principally with cash from product sales  cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities and related interest  and existing capital resources which we believe will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through fiscal year our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our success in commercializing our products  development and commercialization of products in fields other than arthroscopy  the ability of our suppliers to continue to meet our demands at current prices  obtaining and enforcing patents important to our business  the status of regulatory approvals and competition 
at the end of fiscal  we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and approximately million of state net operating loss carryforwards 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in the year and  respectively  if not utilized 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  inventory allowances  warranty costs  goodwill impairments  contingencies and other special charges  and taxes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  which could have an adverse impact on our statement of operations 
a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our revenue could be adversely affected 
inventory allowance inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase our inventory allowances and our gross margins could be adversely affected 
warranty costs we accrue for warranty costs based on historical trends in product return rates and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services 
if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or costs of servicing warranty claims were greater than the expectations on which the accrual had been based  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
goodwill impairment we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted
