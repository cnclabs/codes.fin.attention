communications wire and cable products transmit low voltage signals for voice  data  video and control applications 
energy cables include low  medium and high voltage power distribution and power transmission products 
industrial and specialty wire and cable products conduct electrical current for industrial and commercial power and control applications 
general cable operates its businesses in three main geographic regions north america  europe and oceania 
net sales and operating income of the european business represented approximately and  and  and and of total company consolidated results  excluding corporate operating items  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
over ninety percent of net sales in europe are derived from energy and industrial and specialty cables sales 
as a result  the european business has not been significantly impacted by the global telecommunications spending downturn and is currently benefiting from medium voltage energy cable capacity shortage in europe and a shift towards environmentally friendly cables 
general cable s reported net sales are directly influenced by the price of copper and to a lesser extent aluminum 
the price of copper and aluminum has been subject to considerable volatility  with the daily selling price of copper cathode on the comex averaging per pound in  per pound in and per pound in and the daily selling price of aluminum rod averaging per pound in  per pound in and per pound in however  as a result of a number of practices intended to match copper and aluminum purchases with sales  general cable s profitability has generally not been significantly affected by changes in copper and aluminum prices 
general cable generally passes changes in copper and aluminum prices along to its customers  although there are timing delays of varying lengths depending upon the type of product  competitive conditions and particular customer arrangements 
general cable does not engage in speculative metals trading or other speculative activities 
also  the company does not engage in activities to hedge the underlying value of its copper and aluminum inventory 
general cable generally experiences certain seasonal trends in sales and cash flow 
larger amounts of cash are generally required during the first and second quarters of the year to build inventories in anticipation of higher demand during the spring and summer months  when construction activity increases 
in general  receivables related to higher sales activity during the spring and summer months are collected during the third and fourth quarters of the year 
acquisitions and divestitures during  the company acquired the worldwide energy cable and cable systems businesses of balfour beatty plc  formerly known as bicc plc  with operations in the united states  canada  europe  africa  the middle east and asia pacific the acquisition 
the acquisition was completed in three phases during for a total payment of million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements for periods after the respective closing dates

this facility manufactured cordset products including indoor and outdoor extension cords  temporary lighting and extension cord accessories 
in october  the company sold substantially all of the manufacturing assets and inventory of its building wire business to southwire for million of cash proceeds and the transfer to the company of certain datacommunication cable manufacturing equipment 
under the building wire sale agreement  southwire purchased the inventory and substantially all of the property  plant and equipment located at the company s watkinsville  georgia and kingman  arizona facilities and the wire and cable manufacturing equipment at its plano  texas facility 
general cable retained and continues to operate its copper rod mill in plano  however the company has closed its plano wire mill 
the assets sold were used in manufacturing building wire products principally for the retail and electrical distribution markets 
during the second quarter of  the final purchase price for this transaction was agreed resulting in a deminimis cash payment to southwire 
proceeds from the transaction have been used to reduce the company s outstanding debt 
beginning in the third quarter of  the company has reported the building wire and cordsets segment as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes 
administrative expenses formerly allocated to this segment are now reported in the continuing operations segments 
prior periods have been restated to reflect this change 
during the second quarter of  general cable formed a joint venture company to manufacture and market fiber optic cables

significant accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a summary of significant accounting policies is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of these policies requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management based its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the critical judgments impacting the financial statements include determinations with respect to inventory valuation  pension accounting and valuation allowances for deferred income taxes 
general cable utilizes the last in first out lifo method of inventory accounting for its metals inventory 
the company s use of the lifo method results in its income statement reflecting the current costs of metals  while metals inventories in the balance sheet are valued at historical costs as the lifo layers were created 
as a result of declining copper prices  the historic lifo cost of the company s copper inventory exceeded its replacement cost by approximately million at december  if the company were not able to recover the lifo value of its inventory at a profit in some future period when replacement costs were lower than the lifo value of the inventory  the company would be required to take a charge to recognize in its income statement all or a portion of the higher lifo value of the inventory 
additionally  if lifo inventory quantities were reduced in a period when replacement costs were lower than the lifo value of the inventory  the company would experience a decline in reported earnings 
during  the company recorded a million charge for the liquidation of lifo inventory in north america as the company significantly reduced its inventory levels 
the company expects to further reduce inventory quantities in which is expected to result in an additional lifo liquidation charge 
the amount of the charge to be incurred in will be dependent upon the quantity of the inventory reduction and the market price of the metals at the time of the inventory liquidation 

table of contents pension expense for the defined benefit pension plans sponsored by general cable is determined based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on assets of 
this assumption was based on input from the company s actuaries  including their review of historical year  year  and year rates of inflation and real rates of return on various broad equity and bond indices in conjunction with the diversification of the asset portfolio 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of with equity managers  with an expected real rate of return of  and with fixed income managers  with an expected real rate of return of  and an assumed long term rate of inflation of 
because of market fluctuations  the actual asset allocation as of december  was with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
management believes that our long term asset allocation on average will approximate our assumption and that a long term rate of return is a reasonable assumption 
the determination of pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is based on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a three year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains and losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a three year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
the determination of future pension obligations utilizes a discount rate based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency which are expected to be available during the period to maturity of the projected pension benefits payable  and input from the company s actuaries 
the discount rate used at december  was 
the company evaluates its actuarial assumptions  at least annually  and adjusts them as necessary 
due to the effect of the unrecognized actuarial losses based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions  the company estimates that pension expense for the company s defined benefit plans will be approximately million in future pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans 
general cable records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in an amount that was in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
at december  and  the valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
current business environment general cable is operating in a difficult business environment 
the wire and cable industry is competitive  mature and cost driven 
there is little differentiation amongst the participants in the industry from a manufacturing or technology standpoint 
in addition to these general industry conditions the communications segment is experiencing a significant decline in historical spending levels for outside plant telecommunications products and a weak market for switching local area networking cables and in the industrial and specialty segment industrial construction spending  which influences industrial cable demand  is at one third of historical peak levels 
the company believes its investment in lean six sigma training  coupled with effectively utilized manufacturing assets  provides a substantial cost advantage compared to many of its competitors and generates costs savings which more than offset rising raw material prices and other general economic cost increases 
in addition  the company s customer supplier integration capabilities  one stop selling and geographic and product balance are sources of competitive advantage 
as a result  general cable believes it is well positioned  compared to its competitors  in the current difficult business environment

the following table sets forth metal adjusted revenues by segment  in millions of dollars 
net sales for the year have been adjusted to the copper comex average of per pound and the aluminum rod average of per pound

the decrease in communication products metal adjusted net sales principally relates to lower sales volume of outside plant telecommunications cable and to a lesser extent high bandwidth networking cables 
sales volume for outside plant telecommunications cable decreased year over year as many customers significantly reduced their capital spending in the company anticipates that telecommunications customers capital spending for copper outside plant cables in will be at or around the levels  which represents a significant reduction from historical experience 
as a low cost producer  outside plant telecommunications cable products have historically been one of the company s most profitable business segments 
the timing of the resumption of sales of telecommunications cables to the regional telephone operating companies to more historic levels is unknown and represents the greatest uncertainty with regard to the company s financial performance for the increase of in metal adjusted net sales in the energy products segment is the result of higher volume in the north american market as the company realizes the effect of new contracts won during and higher sales in europe as the company continues to enjoy an increased presence with major european utilities 
during the second half of  the company benefited from contract awards won earlier in the year  including a two year supply agreement with lectricit de france  one of europe s largest electric utility companies 
this contract award for medium voltage energy cables commenced in june and is valued at the equivalent of million over the next two years 
the company also benefited from its expanded position in the italian and united kingdom energy cables markets 
partially offsetting these volume increases was lower pricing in the north american market 
the company anticipates that sales volume for north american customers should continue to improve over time as utility customers are now addressing capital projects that were previously deferred 
these capital project include enhancements to the power transmission and distribution grid 
another factor which may improve north american sales volume is proposed federal legislation which would provide future regulatory rate relief and allow north american utility companies to earn an adequate rate of return on their investment in upgrading the transmission grid infrastructure in the united states 
the decrease in industrial and specialty products metal adjusted net sales includes the negative impact of the march divestiture of the pyrotenax business and the june divestiture of the company s extrusion tooling business 
excluding the impact of these businesses  industrial and specialty products metal adjusted net sales decreased from the prior year 
this decrease is primarily the result of continued 
table of contents weak demand and pricing in many industrial sectors of the north american economy 
this decrease is partially offset by a increase in metal adjusted net sales for the company s international operations 
the company expects continued weak sales volume as the bulk of the end markets for the north american industrial cables are still in recession 
selling  general and administrative expense  before corporate operating items see note  decreased to million in from million in the reduction reflects the lower sales volumes and the impact of an aggressive program implemented since november to eliminate fixed sg a expense and reduce controllable spending 
the program included the elimination of salaried and hourly positions worldwide and other actions

in october  the company recorded other financial costs of million related to the write off of unamortized bank fees as a result of the october credit facility amendment 
of the million  million related to fees paid in april for a prior amendment  the terms of which were substantially amended by the october amendment and million was due to a reduction in the borrowing capacity available under the revolving portion of the credit facility 
during  the company recorded other financial costs of million as a result of recognizing million of costs associated with the implementation of its asset backed securitization program 
the company also wrote off million in unamortized bank fees as a result of a reduction in the borrowing capacity of the company s credit facility due to the application of the pyrotenax proceeds and the asset backed securitization program proceeds against outstanding debt  and the company recorded a loss of million related to interest rate collars which were terminated 
the collars were terminated in part due to the reduction of indebtedness associated with the pyrotenax and pirelli transactions  as well as to allow the company to more fully benefit from the more favorable interest rate environment and future interest rate reductions 
net interest expense  excluding the other financial costs discussed above  was million in compared to million in the decrease reflects reduced debt levels due to the application of the proceeds from non strategic business divestitures  interest savings from the company s accounts receivable asset backed securitization program implemented in the second quarter of and lower base interest rates under the credit facility in partially offset by the amortization of bank fees and higher credit spreads related to its april and october credit facility amendments

the decrease in communication products metal adjusted net sales principally relates to lower sales volume of high bandwidth networking cables and outside plant telecommunications cable 
sales volume for both of these products has decreased year over year with the largest decrease occurring in the second half of as key customers reduced their capital spending 
these sales volume decreases were partially offset by improved selling prices during for outside plant telecommunications cable 
additionally  metal adjusted net sales in the company s international operations increased over from the prior year principally as a result of the company s entry into the iberian communications market in the decrease of in metal adjusted net sales in the energy products segment is the result of lower selling prices for certain segments of the north american energy cable market 
sales volume in the north american energy market was flat compared to the sales volume

a significant portion of the net loss from the divested businesses resulted from the supertension and subsea cables operation 
the supertension operation was severely impacted by low pricing levels as a result of excess capacity in the market and reduced project activity 
operations in italy and at distribution cables in the united kingdom also experienced significant losses in operations in italy experienced demand which was significantly below the prior year and selling prices which declined in response to changes in the competitive nature of the market resulting from the partial privatization of the principal italian utility company 
the distribution cables business experienced demand levels below historical levels primarily due to lower orders from european utilities 
liquidity and capital resources in general  general cable requires cash for working capital  capital expenditures  debt repayment  interest and taxes 
general cable s working capital requirements increase when it experiences strong incremental demand for products and or significant copper and aluminum price increases 
based upon historical experience and the expected availability of funds under the credit facility  the company expects that its sources of liquidity will be sufficient to enable it to meet its cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  debt repayment  interest and taxes in this expectation is based on the company s current outlook which is not dependent upon a significant recovery in the communications or industrial markets in
