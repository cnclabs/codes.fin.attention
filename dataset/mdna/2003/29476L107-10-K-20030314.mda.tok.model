derivative instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes 
the company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments 
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  the company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives 
the following table summarizes the consolidated derivative instruments at december  dollar amounts are in thousands cash flow hedges fair value hedges forward starting swaps offsetting receive floating swaps caps offsetting pay floating swaps caps current notional balance lowest possible notional highest possible notional lowest interest rate highest interest rate earliest maturity date latest maturity date estimated asset liability fair value at december   certain unconsolidated development partnerships in which the company invested had entered into swaps to hedge the interest rate risk exposure on unconsolidated floating rate construction mortgage loans 
the company has recorded its proportionate share of these hedges on its consolidated balance sheets 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges with a current aggregate notional amount of million notional amounts range from million to million over the terms of the swaps at interest rates ranging from to maturing at various dates ranging from to with a net liability fair value of million

as of december   there were approximately million in deferred losses  net  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
based on the estimated fair values of the net derivative instruments at december   the company may recognize an estimated million of accumulated other comprehensive loss as additional interest expense during the twelve months ending december   of which million is related to the unconsolidated development partnerships 
other minority interests as of december  decreased by million when compared to december  the primary factors that impacted this account in the company s consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets during the year were distributions declared to minority interests  which amounted to million for excluding junior preference unit and preference interest distributions  the allocation of income from operations to holders of op units in the amount of million  the allocation of income from operations to partially owned properties in the amount of million  the conversion of op units into common shares  and the issuance of common shares and op units during total distributions paid in january amounted to million excluding distributions on partially owned properties  which included certain distributions declared in the fourth quarter of the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements  including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments  generally through its working capital  net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its line of credit 
the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions 
the company also expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities  property acquisitions  financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes and equity securities  including additional op units  and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties 
in addition  the company has certain unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high 
the fair value of these unencumbered properties are in excess of the required value the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit 
on may   the company obtained a new three year million unsecured revolving credit facility 
the new line of credit replaced the million unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in august the prior existing revolving credit facility was terminated upon the closing of the new facility 
this new facility matures in may and will be used to fund property acquisitions  costs for certain properties under development and short term liquidity requirements 
as of february   million was outstanding under this new facility 
for the year ended december  as of january   the company had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under its lines of credit  of which million was restricted not available to be drawn 
after taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities  the company s cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was approximately million and the amount available on the company s line of credit was million  of which million was restricted not available to be drawn 
part of the company s acquisition and development funding strategy and the funding of investments in various unconsolidated entities is to utilize its lines of credit and to subsequently repay the line of credit from the disposition of properties  retained cash flows or the issuance of additional equity or debt securities 
continuing to utilize this strategy during the year ended  the company disposed of forty nine properties including two unconsolidated properties and two vacant parcels of land and received net proceeds of million  issued million of fixed rate unsecured debt receiving net proceeds of million  sold and or contributed eleven properties to a joint venture and received net proceeds of million  issued approximately million common shares and received net proceeds of million  issued million of four new series of preference interests and received net proceeds of million  obtained million in new mortgage financing  and received million of principal repayments on its investment in second and third mortgages on previously unconsolidated properties

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december the company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  management believes that the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the six critical accounting policies are impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  including its investments in real estate and goodwill  for impairment indicators 
the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions  expected holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns 
future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
depreciation of investment in real estate the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a year estimated useful life  building improvements over a year to year estimated useful life and both the furniture  fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a year estimated useful life  all of which are judgmental determinations 
cost capitalization see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs 
expensing of fixed asset repair and maintenance costs 
in addition  the company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital projects 
these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to building 
the company follows the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred 
the company capitalizes interest  real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities 
the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of employees working directly at our properties  except for costs that are incurred during the initial lease up phase on a development project 
an allocated portion of payroll costs is capitalized based upon the occupancy of the project until stabilized occupancy is achieved 
stabilized occupancy is always deemed to have occurred no later than one year from cessation of major development activities 
the incremental payroll and associated costs are capitalized to the projects under development based upon the effort directly identifiable with such projects 
these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as either construction in progress or a separate component of investments in unconsolidated entities 
the company ceases the capitalization of such costs as the property becomes substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
fair value of financial instruments  including derivative instruments the valuation of financial instruments under sfas no 
and sfas no 
and its amendments sfas nos 
and requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
the company  where possible  bases the fair values of its financial instruments  including its derivative instruments  on listed market prices and third party quotes 
where these are not available  the company bases its estimates on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 
revenue recognition rental income attributable to leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned  which is not materially different than on a straight line basis 
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis 
leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year to year  renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis 
the company adopted the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  effective october  sab no 
provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
stock option compensation the company has chosen to account for its stock option compensation in accordance with apb no 
 which results in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the company s common shares on the date of grant 
the company will elect to expense its stock option compensation in accordance with sfas no 
and its amendment sfas no 
effective in the first quarter of  which will result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock option compensation issued 
funds from operations for the year ended december   funds from operations ffo available to common shares and op units decreased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   ffo available to common shares and op units increased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common shares to ffo available to common shares and op units for the years ended december   and funds from operations amounts in thousands year ended december  net income available to common shares net income allocation to minority interests operating partnership adjustments depreciation depreciation non real estate additions depreciation partially owned properties depreciation unconsolidated properties amortization of goodwill extraordinary items cumulative effect of change in accounting principle impairment on corporate housing business impairment on technology investments net gain on sales of condominium units to third parties net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities discontinued operations depreciation amortization of goodwill impairment on furniture rental business net gain on sales ffo available to common shares and op units basic ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  plus depreciation after adjustments for non real estate additions  partially owned properties and unconsolidated properties  plus amortization of goodwill and plus minus extraordinary items  the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and impairment charges 
adjustments also include net gain on sales of condominium units to third parties and net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities and for discontinued operations related to depreciation  goodwill amortization  impairment on furniture rental business and net gain on sales 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures 
ffo in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the company s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other real estate companies and may differ  for example  due to variations among the company s and other real estate companies accounting policies for replacement type items and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates 
the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured line of credit 
the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures  while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long term fixed rate financing 
the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 
the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk 
interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
see also note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 
the fair values of the company s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents  other assets  lines of credit  accounts payable and accrued expenses  rents received in advance and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature  terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates 
the fair value of the company s mortgage notes payable and unsecured notes approximates their carrying value at december  the company had total outstanding floating rate debt of approximately million  or of total debt at december   including the effects of any interest rate protection agreements 
if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently increased by basis points a increase  the increase in interest expense on the floating rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on all of the floating rate debt permanently decreased by basis points a decrease  the decrease in interest expense on the floating rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s financial instruments 
the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company s floating rate debt and does not differentiate among maturities 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure or results other than interest expense 
the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and  therefore  its exposure to market risk  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate  long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
