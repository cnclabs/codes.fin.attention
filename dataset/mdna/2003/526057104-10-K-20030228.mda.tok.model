item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
some of the statements contained in the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of by their nature  forward looking statements involve risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those which the statements anticipate 
factors which may affect our results include  but are not limited to  changes in general economic conditions  the market for homes and prices for homes generally and in areas where we have developments  the availability and cost of land suitable for residential development  materials prices  labor costs  interest rates  consumer confidence  competition  terrorist acts or other acts of war  environmental factors and government regulations affecting our operations 
results of operations overview we achieved record revenues  profits and earnings per share in our net earnings in were million  or per share diluted  compared to million  or per share diluted  in in  we acquired nine homebuilders which strengthened our positions in several of our existing markets and provided us with attractive growth opportunities in new markets 
the increase in net earnings was also attributable to strong homebuilding gross margins and increased operating earnings from our financial services division 
with million of cash at year end  our net homebuilding debt ie  homebuilding debt less homebuilding cash to total net capital ie  net capital is average net homebuilding debt and stockholders equity ratio was at november   compared to last year

during  we acquired nine homebuilders  which expanded our operations into the carolinas and the chicago  baltimore and central valley  california homebuilding markets and strengthened our positions in several of our existing markets 
the results of operations of the acquired homebuilders are included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates 
during the seven months of fiscal  in which we owned us home and its subsidiaries  us home and its subsidiaries contributed of our homebuilding revenues and of our homebuilding expenses 
revenues from sales of homes increased in and in  compared to the previous years as a result of a increase and a increase in the number of home deliveries  and a increase and a increase in the average sales price in and  respectively 
new home deliveries were higher primarily due to a strong homebuilding market  combined with our acquisitions this year 
new home deliveries were higher primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of us home s homebuilding activity in  compared to seven months inclusion in the average sales price of homes delivered increased in and primarily due to an increase in the average sales price in most of our existing markets  combined with changes in our product mix 
gross margin percentages on home sales were  and in  and  respectively 
the increases in and were due to improved operational efficiencies and strength in the homebuilding markets in which we operate 
the increase in was partially offset by softness in the texas market 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales increased to in compared to and in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in insurance costs  compared to the increase in was primarily due to higher incentive based personnel related expenses  compared to sales of land and other revenues  net totaled million in  compared to million in and million in equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships increased to million in  compared to million in and million in margins achieved on sales of land and equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales by us and our unconsolidated partnerships 
new home orders increased in and in  compared to previous years 
the increase in was primarily due to our recent acquisitions and growth in the number of active communities 
the increase in was due to the inclusion of a full year of us home s homebuilding activity in whereas included only seven months of us home s homebuilding activity 
due to the increase in new home orders and the acquired backlog from acquisitions  the backlog dollar value increased to billion at november   compared to billion at november  financial services our financial services division provides mortgage financing  title insurance  closing services and insurance agency services for both buyers of our homes and others and sells the loans it originates in the secondary mortgage market 
the division also provides high speed internet access  cable television and alarm installation and monitoring services to residents of our communities and others 
the following table sets forth selected financial and operational information relating to our financial services division 
the results of operations of our acquisitions are included in the information since the respective dates of the acquisitions 
years ended november  dollars in thousands revenues costs and expenses operating earnings dollar value of mortgages originated number of mortgages originated mortgage capture rate of lennar homebuyers number of title transactions operating earnings from our financial services division increased to million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to improved results from our mortgage and title operations  which benefited from a low interest rate and strong housing environment in mortgage and title results increased due to both an increase in the number of transactions and profit per transaction in  compared to additionally  strategic technologies  inc generated a million gain on the sale of a cable system 
the increase in compared to was partially attributable to pretax earnings of approximately million primarily related to the sale of our retained mortgage servicing rights 
additionally  the increase reflects the successful operational efficiencies which resulted from the combination of our and us home s mortgage operations under the universal american mortgage banner and the consolidation of our title operations under the north american title banner 
the increase also reflects a greater level of refinance activity and a higher capture rate of our homebuyers  as well as a full year of earnings contribution from us home in the earnings contribution from us home represented of the division s operating earnings in corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in compared to and in and  respectively

interest incurred is capitalized as inventories and relieved as interest expense when homes are delivered 
the average rates for interest incurred were  and in  and  respectively 
the average debt outstanding was billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
financial condition and capital resources at november   we had cash of million  compared to million at the end of fiscal the decrease in cash was primarily due to the funding of our acquisition of nine homebuilders during offset by cash flows provided by operating activities 
during  cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to million  consisting primarily of net earnings offset in part by increased levels of operating assets to support a significantly higher backlog and a higher number of active communities as we continue to grow 
cash flows provided by operating activities in were reduced by financial services loans held for sale of million and million in receivables 
we sell the loans we originate in the secondary mortgage market  generally within thirty days of the closing of the loans 
the cash related to these loans and receivables was primarily received in december and was used to pay down our warehouse lines of credit 
inventories increased million in as we positioned ourselves for future growth 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in the year ended november   compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in in  we used million of cash for acquisitions 
in  million was provided by the sale of substantially all of our mortgage servicing rights and million related to net distributions by unconsolidated partnerships in which we invest 
this generation of cash was offset by million of net additions to operating properties and equipment 
we are always looking at the possibility of acquiring homebuilding or similar companies or their assets 
we frequently enter into confidentiality agreements before we begin our exploratory evaluations of possible acquisition opportunities 
at november   we were a party to confidentiality agreements relating to a number of homebuilding and other companies  including several publicly held companies 
our exploratory evaluations under these or future confidentiality agreements may result in acquisition transactions 
during  we acquired nine homebuilders  which expanded our operations into the carolinas and the chicago  baltimore and central valley  california homebuilding markets and strengthened our positions in several of our existing markets 
in connection with these acquisitions  total consideration  including debt of acquired companies  totaled approximately million 
the results of operations of the acquired homebuilders are included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates 
we finance our land acquisition and development activities  construction activities  financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations and public debt issuances  as well as cash borrowed under revolving credit facilities 
we also buy land under option agreements  which enable us to acquire homesites when we are ready to build homes on them 
the financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings is managed by prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets  careful management of the land development process  and limitation of risk by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land  as well as obtaining access to land through option arrangements 
on february   we issued million of senior notes due at a price of 
the senior notes are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of our subsidiaries  other than subsidiaries engaged in mortgage and reinsurance activities 
proceeds from the offering  after underwriting discount and expenses  were approximately million 
we added the proceeds to our general working capital so that the proceeds will be available for use in our operations  for acquisitions and to purchase or repay outstanding indebtedness 
the senior notes were issued under our million shelf registration statement 
the majority of our short term financing needs are met with cash generated from operations and funds available under our senior secured credit facilities 
in may  we amended and restated our senior secured credit facilities the credit facilities  to provide us with up to billion of financing 
the credit facilities consist of a million revolving credit facility maturing in april  a million day revolving credit facility maturing in april and a million term loan b maturing in may we may elect to convert borrowings under the day revolving credit facility to a term loan  which would mature in april at november   million was outstanding under the term loan b and we had paid down our revolving credit facilities to zero 
interest rates are libor based and the margins are set by a pricing grid with thresholds that adjust based on changes in our leverage ratio and the credit facilities credit rating 
at november   we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of million  of which million were collateralized against certain borrowings available under the credit facilities 
the following summarizes our senior notes and other debts payable november  in thousands zero coupon senior convertible debentures due zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due senior notes due senior notes due term loan b due us home senior notes due through the fortress group  inc senior notes due mortgage notes on land our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total net capital was at november   compared to at november  the decrease primarily resulted from cash generated by our operations during in addition to the use of capital in our ordinary homebuilding and financial services activities  we will continue to actively evaluate various other uses of capital which fit into our homebuilding and financial services strategies and appear to meet our profitability and return on capital requirements 
this may include acquisitions of or investments in other entities 
these activities may be funded through any combination of our credit facilities  cash generated from operations  sales of assets or the issuance of public debt  common stock or preferred stock 
at november   our financial services division had a million warehouse line of credit which included a million day increase which expired in december to fund the division s mortgage loan activities 
borrowings under this facility were million at november   and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold not yet funded with outstanding principal balances of million 
the warehouse line of credit matures in october  at which time we expect the facility to be renewed 
at november   we had advances under a conduit funding agreement with a major financial institution amounting to million 
borrowings under this agreement are collateralized by mortgage loans 
we also had a million revolving line of credit with a bank  collateralized by certain assets of the division and stock of certain title subsidiaries 
borrowings under the line of credit were million at november  the limited purpose finance subsidiaries of our financial services division have placed mortgages and other receivables as collateral for various long term financings 
these limited purpose finance subsidiaries pay the principal of  and interest on  these financings almost entirely from the cash flows generated by the related pledged collateral  which includes a combination of mortgage notes  mortgage backed securities and funds held by a trustee 
at november   the balance outstanding for the bonds and notes payable was million 
the borrowings mature in years through and the annual principal repayments are dependent upon collections on the underlying mortgages  including prepayments  and cannot be reasonably determined 
we have various interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on approximately million of outstanding debt related to our homebuilding operations 
the interest rate swaps mature at various dates through and fix the libor index to which certain of our debt interest rates are tied at an average interest rate of at november  the net effect on our operating results is that interest on the variable rate debt being hedged is recorded based on fixed interest rates 
counterparties to each of the above agreements are major financial institutions 
at november   the fair value of the interest rate swaps  net of tax  was a million liability 
our financial services division  in the normal course of business  uses derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the division enters into forward commitments and option contracts to protect the value of loans held for sale or disposition from increases in market interest rates 
we do not anticipate that we will suffer credit losses from counterparty non performance 
our stock option and restricted stock plan the plan provides for the granting of stock options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock to key officers  employees and directors 
the exercise prices of stock options and stock appreciation rights are not less than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant 
no options granted under the plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant 
thereafter  exercises are permitted in installments determined when the options are granted 
each stock option and stock appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not more than years after the date of the grant 
at november    shares of restricted stock were outstanding under the plan 
the restricted stock is valued based on its market price on the date of grant 
the grants vest over years from the issuance date 
unearned compensation arising from the restricted stock grants is amortized to expense over the period of restrictions and is shown as a reduction of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
in june  our board of directors increased our previously authorized stock repurchase program to permit future purchases of up to million shares of our common stock 
we may repurchase these shares in the open market from time to time 
during and  we did not repurchase any of our outstanding common stock in the open market under these authorizations 
as of november   in prior years under prior approvals  we had repurchased approximately million shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  or per share 
during  our treasury stock increased by approximately  shares related to employee stock plans and share reacquisitions at the time of vesting of restricted stock 
in recent years  we have sold convertible and non convertible debt into public markets  and at year end  we had effective securities act registration statements under which we could sell to the public up to million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock or other securities and up to million of equity or debt securities which it may issue in connection with acquisitions of companies or interests in them  businesses  or assets 
our million shelf registration statement was reduced by million from the issuance of senior notes in february our willingness to use common stock in acquisitions  or to sell common stock  could be adversely affected by the fact that if at any time our class b common stock which entitles holders to ten votes per share  is essentially non transferable other than through conversion into common stock and is almost entirely owned by entities controlled by stuart miller  our president and chief executive officer  and his family is less than of the outstanding common stock and class b common stock taken together  all the class b common stock will automatically be converted into common stock 
we are proposing to increase the outstanding class b common stock and therefore  the number of shares of common stock we can issue without endangering the class b common stock by distributing to our stockholders one share of class b common stock for each ten shares of common stock or class b common stock already held  if our stockholders approve changes to the class b common stock that would enable it to be publicly traded 
we are also asking our stockholders to increase the number of shares of common stock and class b common stock we are authorized to issue 
based on our current financial condition and credit relationships  we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of growth 
investments in unconsolidated partnerships we frequently enter into partnerships that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties 
through partnerships  we reduce and share our risk and also the amount invested in land while increasing access to potential future homesites 
the use of partnerships also  in some instances  enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access  or could not obtain access on as favorable terms  without the participation of a strategic partner 
our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders  land sellers or other real estate professionals 
while we view the use of unconsolidated partnerships as beneficial to our homebuilding activities  we do not view them as essential to those activities 
most of the partnerships in which we invest are accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
at november   we had ownership interests of between to in these unconsolidated partnerships 
in many instances  we are appointed as the day to day manager of the partnerships and receive fees for performing this function 
during  and  we received management fees and reimbursement of expenses totaling million  million and million  respectively  from unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests 
we and or our partners sometimes obtain options or enter into other arrangements under which we can purchase portions of the land held by the unconsolidated partnerships 
option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair value when we receive the options 
during  and  million  million and million  respectively  of the unconsolidated partnerships revenues were from land sales to our homebuilding divisions 
at november   the unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests had total assets of billion and total liabilities of million  which included million of notes and mortgages payable 
in some instances  we and or our partners have provided varying levels of guarantees on certain partnership debt 
at november   we had recourse guarantees of million and limited maintenance guarantees of million of the partnerships debts 
when we provide guarantees  the partnership generally receives more favorable terms from its lenders 
the limited maintenance guarantees only apply if a partnership defaults on its loan arrangements and the carrying value of the collateral generally land and improvements is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance 
if we are required to make a payment under a limited maintenance guarantee to bring the carrying value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance  the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated partnership and increase our share of any funds it distributes 
during  the unconsolidated partnerships in which we were a partner generated million of revenues and incurred million of expenses  resulting in net earnings of million 
our share of those net earnings was million 
we do not include in our income our pro rata share of partnership earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions 
instead  we account for those earnings as a reduction of our cost of purchasing the land from the partnerships 
this in effect defers recognition of our share of the partnership earnings until a home is delivered and title passes to a homebuyer 
at the time of the transfer of our commercial real estate investment business to lnr property corporation lnr  and the spin off of lnr to our stockholders  we formed lennar land partners  a owned unconsolidated partnership with lnr  which is included in the unconsolidated partnerships discussed above 
we also have several other unconsolidated partnerships with lnr 
in these partnerships  we provide the residential development experience and lnr contributes the commercial property expertise 
in  and  we purchased land from lennar land partners for a total of million  million and million  respectively  which approximated fair value 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations at november  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years over years dollars in thousands homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable financial services notes and other debts payable including limited purpose finance subsidiaries operating leases total contractual cash obligations we are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts including option contracts for the purchase  development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business 
option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated partnerships 
this reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings 
at november   we had million of primarily non refundable option deposits with entities  which allows us to acquire approximately  homesites 
we are committed  under various letters of credit  to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business 
outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled million at november  additionally  we had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects with estimated costs to complete of million 
we do not believe that draws upon these bonds  if any  will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our financial services division s pipeline of loans in process totaled approximately billion at november  to minimize credit risk  we use the same credit policies in the approval of the commitments as are applied to our lending activities 
since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers  the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
loans in the pipeline of loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrower totaled approximately million as of november  substantially all of these commitments were for periods of days or less 
our financial services division uses mandatory mortgage backed securities forward commitments mbs to hedge our interest rate exposure during the period from when we make an interest rate commitment to a loan applicant until the time at which the loan is sold to an investor 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk 
credit risk is managed by entering into mbs only with investment bankers with primary dealer status and with permanent investors meeting our credit standards 
our risk  in the event of default by the purchaser  is the difference between the contract price and current market value 
at november   we had open commitments amounting to million to sell mbs with varying settlement dates through january economic conditions despite difficult economic conditions in large portions of the united states during much of  the homebuilding environment remained strong due to a positive supply demand relationship as well as low interest rates 
as a result of this favorable environment  as well as recent homebuilding acquisitions and growth in the number of our active communities  our new orders increased by in although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical  it has not undergone a down cycle in a number of years 
this has led some people to assert that the prices of homes and the stocks of homebuilding companies are overvalued and will decline rapidly when the market for new homes begins to weaken 
a decline in prices of stocks of homebuilding companies would make it more expensive  and could make it more difficult  for us to raise funds through stock issuances 
backlog backlog represents the number of homes subject to pending sales contracts 
homes are sold using sales contracts which are generally accompanied by sales deposits 
before entering into sales contracts  we generally prequalify our customers 
in some instances  purchasers are permitted to cancel sales contracts if they are unable to close on the sale of their existing home or fail to qualify for financing and under certain other circumstances 
we experienced an average cancellation rate of in  compared to and in and  respectively 
although cancellations can delay the sales of our homes  they have not had a material impact on sales  operations or liquidity  because we closely monitor the progress of prospective buyers in obtaining financing and use the information to adjust construction start plans to match anticipated deliveries of homes 
we do not recognize revenue on homes covered by pending sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners 
seasonality we have historically experienced variability in results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business 
we typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first half of the calendar year  although the rate of orders for new homes is highly dependent on the number of active communities and the timing of new community openings 
because new home deliveries trail orders for new homes by several months  we typically have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year compared to the first half 
as a result  our earnings from sales of homes are generally higher in the second half of the fiscal year 
interest rates and changing prices inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land  materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes 
in addition  inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates  which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction 
rising interest rates  as well as increased materials and labor costs  may reduce gross margins 
in recent years  the increases in these costs have followed the general rate of inflation and hence have not had a significant adverse impact on us 
in addition  deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs 
therefore  either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
no longer permits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived assets 
instead  these assets must be reviewed annually or more frequently under certain conditions for impairment in accordance with this statement 
this impairment test uses a fair value approach rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach previously required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we adopted sfas no 
on december  no impairment charges were recognized from the adoption of this statement 
as of november  and  there are no material identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill 
pro forma net earnings and earnings per share for both fiscal and are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

in december  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we do not believe that the implementation of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation fin no

the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 
are applied only on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
we do not believe that the implementation of fin no

in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
provides accounting guidance for consolidation of off balance sheet entities with certain characteristics variable interest entities 
the consolidation requirements apply to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which we maintain an interest after august  we are in the process of evaluating all of our investments and other interests in entities that may be deemed variable interest entities under the provisions of fin no 
these include interests in unconsolidated partnerships with assets totaling approximately billion at november  our maximum exposure to loss represents our recorded investment in these partnerships totaling million 
we believe that many of these interests and entities will not be consolidated  and may not ultimately fall under the provisions of fin no 
we cannot make any definitive conclusion until we complete our evaluation 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application 
homebuilding division revenue recognition sales of homes are recognized when sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners 
additionally  sales of other real estate including sales of land and operating properties are recognized when a significant down payment is received  the earnings process is complete and collectibility of the receivable is assured 
we do not include in our income our pro rata share of partnership earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions 
instead  we account for those earnings as a reduction of our cost of purchasing the land from the partnerships 
this in effect defers recognition of our share of the partnership earnings until a home is delivered and title passes to a homebuyer 
we believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue recognition 
inventories inventories are stated at cost  unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired  in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value 
inventory costs include land  land development and home construction costs  real estate taxes and interest related to development and construction 
land  land development  amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas 
we evaluate our inventory for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from an asset is less than the reported value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of impairment to recognize is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change because of the assumptions about future sales and cost of sales and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported in our consolidated balance sheets as well as our net earnings could be material 
our assumptions about future home sales prices and volumes require significant judgment because the residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical  it has not undergone a down cycle in a number of years 
while no impairment existed as of november   there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a continued slowdown in the economy  might not lead to impairment of inventory 
warranty costs we subcontract virtually all segments of construction to others and while our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trade  we are primarily responsible to correct any deficiencies 
additionally  in some instances  we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors 
warranty reserves are established in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and outside labor to be incurred during the warranty period 
reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment 
at november   the reserve for warranty costs was million 
while we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate  there can be no assurances that the use of historical data and trends will resemble the actual warranty costs 
additionally  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 
investments in unconsolidated partnerships we frequently enter into partnerships that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties 
our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders  land sellers or other real estate professionals 
most of the partnerships through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting  because we have a significant  but less than controlling  interest in the partnerships 
we record the investment in these partnerships in the consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated partnerships and our share of the partnerships earnings or losses as equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships as described in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  advances to these partnerships are included in the investment amount 
judgment is required in determining controlling interest 
factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing  experience and financial condition of the other partners  voting rights  involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement 
due to the judgment required in determining whether we have control or only significant influence  the accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy 
as of november   we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated partnerships where we do not have a controlling interest but rather share control with our partners 
at november   the unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests had total assets of billion and total liabilities of million 
financial services division revenue recognition loan origination revenues  net of direct origination costs  are recognized when the related loans are sold 
gains and losses from the sale of loans and loan servicing rights are recognized when the loans are sold and delivered to an investor 
premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the policy 
escrow fees are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed  usually upon the close of escrow 
in all circumstances  we do not recognize revenue until the earnings process is complete and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured 
we believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue recognition 
allowance for loss reserves we provide an allowance for loan losses when and if we determine that loans or portions of them are not likely to be collected 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we consider various factors such as past loan loss experience  regulatory examinations  present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by management 
anticipated changes in economic conditions  which may influence the level of the allowance  are considered in the evaluation by management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers financial conditions or prospects 
at november   we also had an allowance for title and escrow losses of million for both known and incurred but not reported claims which requires management s judgments and estimates 
for these reasons  we believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loss reserves is a critical accounting estimate 
at november   the allowance for loan losses was million 
while we believe that the year end allowance was adequate  particularly in view of the fact that we usually sell the loans within days after we originate them  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a continued slowdown in the economy  might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher incidence of loan charge offs 
homebuilding and financial services divisions goodwill valuation goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
the process of determining goodwill requires judgment 
evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that the conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change  which could result in a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
for those reasons  we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate 
during fiscal  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we performed a test for impairment of goodwill as of december   which resulted in no impairment being identified 
goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
instead  we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
historically through fiscal  we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over periods ranging from to years 
at november   goodwill was million net of accumulated amortization of million 
while we believe that no impairment existed as of november   there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a continued slowdown in the economy  might not lead to impairment of goodwill 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we believe that the accounting policy for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting policy because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect our ability to realize anticipated tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
although it is possible there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates  we believe it is unlikely such changes would have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations 
at november   we had a valuation allowance of million for net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and certain acquisition adjustments 
based on our assessment  it appears more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings
