item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the primary business of warwick is the operation of its wholly owned subsidiaries  warwick savings  towne center and hardenburgh 
presently  the only significant assets of warwick are the capital stock of warwick savings  towne center and hardenburgh  the note evidencing the loan warwick made to the warwick community bancorp  inc employee stock ownership plan esop to allow the esop to purchase of the company s common stock issued in the company s initial public offering and the investment of the net proceeds of the offering retained by the company 
the results of operations of the company consists primarily those of warwick savings activities 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowed funds 
the company also generates other income  such as service charges and other fees 
other expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy expenses  federal deposit insurance premiums  net costs of real estate owned  data processing fees and other operating expenses 
the company s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards and actions of regulatory agencies 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of the company s significant accounting policies 
management believes the company s policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations 
this critical policy and its application is periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors 
the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio  giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the company s loans are secured by real estate in the states of new york and new jersey 
accordingly  the collectibility of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the company s loan portfolio is susceptible 
next page to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or the new york and new jersey areas experience adverse economic shock 
further adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the company s control 
management strategy the company has historically employed an operating strategy that emphasizes the origination of one to four family residential mortgage loans in its market area with both fixed and variable rates and  to an increasing degree over the past years  its commercial lending business  with loans secured by real estate located mainly in orange  putnam and rockland county  new york and in bergen and passaic county  new jersey 
due in part to this strategy  the company historically has had profitable operations  resulting in a strong regulatory capital position 
the company s goal of maintaining this position has led to an overall strategy of managed growth in both deposits and assets 
in december  the company modified its operating strategy by emphasizing the production of one to four family residential mortgage loans through a private label third party contractor that processes  underwrites and closes these loans on the company s behalf 
all residential mortgage loans originated in this manner are currently being sold by the company 
this change is expected to increase the company s fee income while reducing the costs associated with originating residential loans 
the company intends to continue its emphasis on increasing the commercial and consumer loan including home equity loans portfolios as a percentage of total loans 
these loans reprice more frequently  have shorter maturities  and or higher yields than one to four family first mortgage loans 
the major elements of the company s operating strategy are to i grow and diversify the company s loan portfolio by continuing to originate owner occupied  residential mortgage loans for sale and commercial business  commercial real estate  construction and consumer loans to be held in its loan portfolio  ii complement the company s lending activities by investing in mortgage backed and other securities  iii maintain the company s relatively low cost of funds and iv manage the company s level of interest rate risk 
the company also seeks to attract and retain customers through extended office hours  low turnover of employees and prompt  flexible and personalized production of a variety of loan products 
in addition  it is a goal of the company to increase its market share in the communities it serves through the acquisition or establishment of branch offices and  if appropriate  the acquisition of smaller financial institutions 
additionally  it is a goal of the company to expand into new markets 
the company expanded its operations and lending into new jersey and formed towne center in  which is headquartered in bergen county  new jersey 
in february  the company acquired hardenburgh  a title insurance agency subsidiary  which operates in goshen  new york 
in addition  through the may acquisition of the carmel  new york banking office of country bank  warwick savings expanded its operations into putnam county  new york 
management of interest rate risk the principal objectives of the company s interest rate risk management activities are to i evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  ii determine the level of risk appropriate given the company s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  iii establish prudent asset concentration guidelines and iv manage the risk consistent with board approved policies and guidelines 
through such management  the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operating results to changes in interest rates and to manage the ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities within specified maturities or repricing dates 
although the company closely monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operating strategies  the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of warwick savings 

next page the company has taken several actions  under various market conditions  designed to manage its level of interest rate risk 
these actions have included i increasing the percentage of the loan portfolio consisting of adjustable rate commercial and consumer loans through originations  as market conditions permit  ii selling one to four family residential loans  iii purchasing shorter term investment securities and iv seeking to increase the percentage of checking accounts in its deposit base 
gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets or liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  therefore  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined based on the earlier of term to repricing or the term to repayment of the asset or liability 
the table is intended to provide an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be reinvested and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated early payoffs of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans  and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans

for purposes of the gap analysis  unearned fees and deferred loan origination costs are prorated 
for purposes of the gap analysis  based upon the company s historical experience  management traditionally slots of total savings account balances into the twelve month time horizon 
at december   the company s total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year exceeded its total interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in the same time period by million  representing a one year cumulative gap  as defined above  as a percentage of total assets of 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to make scheduled payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is also monitored by management through the use of a model which internally generates estimates of the change in net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate 
next page change scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and offbalance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
for purposes of the npv table  prepayment speeds similar to those used in the gap table were used  reinvestment rates were those in effect for similar products being offered and rates on core deposits were modified to reflect recent trends 
the following table sets forth the company s npv as of december   as calculated by the company 
net portfolio value portfolio value of assets dollars in thousands rate in basis points rate shock amount change change npv ratio change static  n m n m n m n m n m based upon the portfolio value of the company s assets assuming no change in interest rates 
as in the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv requires the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in actual market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv model presented assumes that the composition of the company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
average balance sheets 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s consolidated statements of financial condition and consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods shown 
the yields and costs were derived by dividing interest income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
average balances were computed based on average daily balances 
the yields include deferred fees and discounts which are considered yield adjustments
