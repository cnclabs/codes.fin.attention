wholesale sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in wholesale sales of the company s village series products decreased million  or  while sales of general giftware products increased million  or between the two periods 
village series products represented of the company s sales during versus during the decrease in wholesale sales is due to several factors  including an overall weakness in the economy which has forced some of the company s customers to go out of business or reduce their demand  and the inability of total new customer order volume to offset historical total order volume of exiting customers 
the company has enacted programs to curb the decline in customers and wholesale sales experienced over the past three years including implementing new customer ordering and shipping programs  strengthening its sales organization  refining its product development process  improving the gift and decorating appeal of its product  page broadening the seasonal coverage of its product lines  and pursuing alternative channels of retail distribution through the simple traditions product framework 
although management believes that some customer attrition is likely to continue  the company experienced a net increase in the number of specialty retail and other general giftware customers in over  and s net decrease in the number of collectible product accounts has slowed to approximately of the decrease experienced in retail sales increased million from million in to million in the increase in retail revenues for the year was primarily attributable to the inclusion of january results from the seasonal stores and kiosks opened for the first time during as well as the increase in the number of seasonal stores and kiosks operated in during  the company operated seasonal stores and seasonal kiosks compared to seasonal stores and seasonal kiosks operated in comparable sales in the company s two year round stores that were open for a full year in both years increased 
average sales per location for the seasonal stores and kiosks during the fourth quarter decreased and  respectively 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and in and  respectively 
the increase in the gross profit rate for the year was principally due to the increase in retail sales which carry higher gross profit than wholesale sales and the decreased provision for excess and slow moving inventory resulting from the company s tightened wholesale inventory management 
the gross profit rate increase was partially offset by a shift in the mix of wholesale product shipments toward the general giftware product lines 
retail sales represented of sales in fiscal compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  between and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were approximately in and in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal was principally due to the increase in retail operations which have higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales than wholesale net sales partially offset by non recurring expenses related to the company s th anniversary celebration in  wholesale cost control initiatives and decreased depreciation expense as a result of the million reduction in net depreciable assets from the litigation settlement described below 
income from operations income from operations decreased million  or  from to  excluding goodwill and trademark amortization 
operating margins decreased from of net sales in to of net sales in the decrease in income from operations was primarily attributable to the losses from the company s seasonal store and kiosk operations due to the difficult retail environment 
for fiscal  the company does not anticipate operating seasonal store locations and plans to reduce the number of seasonal kiosks to increase profitability 
the company currently plans to open two year round stores in and to continue to expand its time to celebrate direct selling business 
the international longshore and warehouse union workers west coast labor dispute previously reported in the company s quarterly report on form q for the third quarter of fiscal did not have a material impact on income from operations in page interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  between and the decrease in interest expense resulted from a lower interest rate environment  as well as a decrease in the amount of term debt outstanding 
the company pre paid million of its term debt in may of litigation settlement on march   the company received net proceeds before income taxes of million in settlement of the company s litigation against arthur andersen llp and andersen worldwide soci t coop rative concerning implementation of its information systems 
this recovery resulted in other income of million and a million reduction in net depreciable assets 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was and during and  respectively 
the change in income tax rates is due to several factors 
first  the company recorded adjustments to its income tax provision of million and million in and  respectively  for the reversal of prior year tax accruals that were no longer needed 
secondly  reflects the recognition of a deferred tax valuation allowance of million to reserve against the future deductibility of the capital losses recognized from its minority investment in day designs  inc finally  the company s decreased income tax provision rate for reflects the change in accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets previously reported 
management anticipates that the income tax provision rate for will be approximately  excluding any unanticipated one time adjustments 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective december  under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
with the adoption of this statement  the company ceased amortization of its goodwill and indefinite lived trademarks as of december  and recorded a million charge to write down its goodwill related to the leveraged buyout of the company in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of results of operations to net sales net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in sales was principally due to a decrease in wholesale sales  partially offset by an increase in retail sales 
wholesale sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease was due to lower sales volume to existing wholesale customers as well as sales to fewer wholesale customers in than in the decrease in customers was principally due to the problems experienced during the implementation of the company s enterprise wide computer system and an overall weakness in the economy that has forced some of the company s customers to go out of business 
the decrease in sales was partially offset by the impact of a customer appreciation discount that the company offered on orders taken during the first quarter of and higher charges for page product claims in product claims returned to normal levels during wholesale sales of the company s village series products decreased million  or  while sales of general giftware products decreased million  or between the two periods 
village series products represented of the company s sales during versus during retail sales increased million from million in to million in principally due to the company s acquisition of geppeddo during the third quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
retail sales also increased due to the company opening its third full line department branded retail store as well as testing ten department branded seasonal stores during the peak holiday shopping season 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and in and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the customer appreciation discount and the higher charges for product claims  gross profit as a percent of sales would have been approximately in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during compared to this adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales for was primarily the result of higher charges recorded to provide for excess inventories and a shift in product mix toward general giftware as noted above 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  between and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were approximately in and in in  the company recorded higher than normal bad debt costs as a result of the problems experienced during the implementation of the company s new enterprise wide computer system beginning in early  as previously communicated 
excluding the impact on net sales of the customer appreciation discount and the higher charges for product claims and the impact on selling  general and administrative expense from higher bad debt costs  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been approximately in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in compared to the adjusted percentage in is principally due to an increase in retail store operations resulting from the acquisition of geppeddo  the company opening its third retail store  consumer research and the testing of ten seasonal stores during the peak holiday shopping season 
retail net sales  which have higher selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales than wholesale net sales  represented of total net sales in compared to in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was also higher in due to the decrease in wholesale sales 
many of the company s wholesale operating expenses such as rent and labor do not vary directly with net sales 
as a result  wholesale operating expenses were not reduced proportionately with the decrease in wholesale net sales 
income from operations income from operations decreased million  or  from to due to the factors described above 
operating margins decreased from of net sales in to of net sales in excluding the impact of the customer appreciation discount and the higher charges for product claims and bad debts  income from operations would have been approximately of net sales in page interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  between and principally due to decreased borrowings under the company s credit facilities as a result of improved cash collections  lower inventory balances  and higher cash balances at the beginning of interest expense also decreased due to lower interest rates paid by the company in impairment and equity in losses of minority investment during  the company recognized a million impairment of the company s minority investment in day designs  inc the impairment charge reduced the carrying value of the company s minority investment to zero 
the company has not guaranteed any debt obligations of day designs  inc provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was and during and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate in was higher primarily because the company recognized no tax benefit associated with its impairment charge of day designs  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this increase was partially offset by a million tax benefit that the company recorded related to prior year tax accruals that were no longer needed 
seasonality historically  due to the timing of wholesale trade shows early in the calendar year  the company has received the majority of its total annual wholesale customer orders during the first quarter of each year 
changes in the company s ordering and shipping programs and its sales force organization  together with customers growing recognition of the company s enhanced ability to receive and fulfill orders throughout the year and increased customer reluctance to commit early at high order levels due largely to general economic uncertainty  have been the principal factors in gradually shifting the seasonality of order input towards later in the year 
thus  the company entered of its total net annual wholesale customer orders for during the first quarter of that year  by comparison  first quarter wholesale orders for and averaged of the total net annual wholesale order input 
cancellations of total annual wholesale customer orders were approximately and in and  respectively 
orders not shipped in a particular year  net of cancellations  are carried into backlog for the following year and have historically been orders for spring and easter products 
the company s backlog of wholesale customer orders was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company receives products  pays its suppliers and ships products throughout the year  although historically the majority of wholesale shipments occur in the second and third quarters as retailers stock merchandise in anticipation of the holiday season 
as a result of this seasonal pattern  the company generally records its highest wholesale sales during the second and third quarters of each year 
however  the company can experience fluctuations in quarterly sales and related net income compared with the prior year due to the timing of receipt of product from suppliers and subsequent shipment of product from the company to customers  as well as the timing of orders placed by customers 
in addition  the company recognizes the majority of its retail sales in the fourth quarter during the peak holiday shopping season 
the company is not managed to maximize quarter to quarter results  but rather to achieve annual objectives designed to achieve long term growth consistent with the company s business strategy

wholesale customer orders entered exclude orders from company operated retail stores 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or  from million in to million in principally due to lower cash collections  higher income tax payments  and higher inventory balances  offset partially by the million in other income recorded as a result of the litigation settlement 
cash collections were lower than sales in due to an increase in sales qualifying for extended dating terms that resulted in cash collections in the first quarter of cash collections were higher than sales in due to higher than normal accounts receivable balances at the end of income tax payments were higher in due to the tax associated with the million in net proceeds before income taxes from the litigation settlement as well as the timing of when income tax payments were made 
inventory balances were higher in due to the increase in the company s seasonal store and kiosk locations which continue operations and thus carry inventory into the following year 
additionally  the company accelerated payments on certain inventory purchases during to take advantage of favorable terms 
consistent with customary practice in the giftware industry  the company offers extended accounts receivable terms to many of its wholesale customers 
this practice has typically created significant working capital requirements in the second and third quarters that the company has generally financed with internally generated cash flow and seasonal borrowings 
the company s cash and cash equivalents balances peak early in the first quarter of the subsequent year  following the collection of wholesale customer accounts receivable with extended payment terms and cash receipts from the company s retail operations 
accounts receivable  net of reserves  which principally consists of wholesale trade receivables increased by  from million at december  to million at december  the increase in accounts receivable was principally due to an increase in the amount of sales qualifying for extended dating terms that result in cash collections in the first quarter of the subsequent year as well as a decrease in the allowance for sales returns and credits 
management believes there is adequate provision for any doubtful accounts receivable and product claims that may arise 
page inventories increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in inventories was principally due to the increase in the company s seasonal store and kiosk locations  which continue operations and thus carry inventory into the following year 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
management anticipates capital expenditures to approximate to of annual wholesale revenues plus approximately million for each year round retail store opened during the year 
the company plans to open two year round stores in fiscal during the third quarter of  the company completed its million acquisition of geppeddo  a privately held designer  importer and specialty retailer based in salt lake city whose products  primarily porcelain dolls  doll accessories and plush items  are marketed under the brand name geppeddo 
the selling shareholders of the acquired business have the ability to earn up to an additional million of cash consideration if certain pre specified financial performance measures are attained by february  during  the company repurchased million shares at an average price of per share 
no shares were repurchased in and since january  the company has repurchased a total of million shares 
the company had no remaining authorization from the board of directors to repurchase any additional shares at the end of  except to accept officer surrenders of restricted shares upon vesting as payment for estimated income tax liabilities incurred as a result of such vesting 
the company s strategy includes the pursuit of a significant acquisition that aligns with and complements its existing business 
as a result  the company intends to accumulate cash over the next several years 
in the event the company is not able to identify any acceptable acquisition by mid  the company intends to return cash to its shareholders at that time 
the company s credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility 
as of december   the total term debt outstanding was million and required amortization payments of million and million due in march and  respectively 
on march   the company committed to prepay million of its term debt in march the revolving line of credit provides for borrowings of up to million  which may be in the form of letters of credit  bankers acceptances  and revolving credit loans 
the letters of credit are issued primarily in connection with inventory purchases 
the revolving line of credit includes a clean down provision whereby the company s revolving credit loans and bankers acceptances may not exceed an aggregate of million during any one consecutive day period beginning november and ending march borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to certain borrowing base limitations as defined 
the company s borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility as of december  was million and will fluctuate during based on accounts receivable and inventory levels 
the revolving line of credit provides for commitment fees of to per annum on the daily average of the unused commitment 
the credit agreement allows the company to choose between two interest rate options in connection with its term loan and revolving credit loans 
the interest rate options are the alternate base rate as defined or the libor rate as page defined plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin ranges from to for libor rate loans 
the credit agreement expires march  the credit agreement includes restrictions as to  among other things  the amount of additional indebtedness  liens  contingent obligations  investments and dividends 
under the most restrictive of these covenants  approximately million of retained earnings were restricted at december  the credit agreement also requires maintenance of minimum levels of interest coverage  net worth and maximum levels of leverage  in each case at the end of each fiscal quarter 
none of these restrictions are expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to operate in the future 
the company has pledged the common stock of its subsidiaries  direct and indirect  as collateral under the credit agreement  and the company and its subsidiaries  direct and indirect  have guaranteed repayment of amounts borrowed under the credit agreement 
the company believes that its internally generated cash flow and seasonal borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund operations and capital expenditures for the next months 
wholesale credit and return policies the company has credit policies that establish specific criteria related to creditworthiness that its customers must meet prior to the shipment of product to the customer 
the company periodically makes limited and selective exceptions to its policy of not shipping to customers with overdue balances when the particular customer has met specific criteria which are indicative of a wherewithal to pay their past due and future balances 
the company does not accept returns from wholesale customers without its prior authorization 
returns are typically accepted only for damaged or defective goods  or for pricing or shipping discrepancies 
the company reserves the right to refuse authorization of any returns and to discard any unauthorized returns 
if the company accepts an unauthorized return or if a return is the result of a customer error  the wholesale customer may be subject to a handling charge 
the company reserves the right to cancel open orders or backorders for those wholesale customers who abuse or excessively use return privileges 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the selection and application of its accounting policies are appropriately reasoned 
the following are the accounting policies that management believes require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
sales returns and credits an allowance is established for credits related to possible returned or damaged product 
the amount of the allowance is based on historical ratios of credits to sales  the historical average length of time between the sale and the credit  and other factors 
changes in customers behavior versus historical experience  changes in product damage or defect rates  or changes in the company s return policies are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
in  sales returns and credits as a percentage of wholesale sales were approximately 
historically  sales returns and credits as a percentage of wholesale sales have been between and 
based on sales returns and credits  a increase or decrease in sales returns and credits would have had an impact of approximately million 
page inventory valuation inventory is written down for estimated surplus and discontinued inventory items 
the amount is determined by analyzing historical and projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
the company procures product based on forecasted sales volume 
if actual sales were significantly lower than forecasted sales due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions  it could result in materially higher surplus and discontinued inventories 
based on inventory write downs  a increase or decrease in inventory write downs would have had an impact of less than million 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance is established for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
the required allowance is determined by reviewing customer accounts and making estimates of amounts that may be uncollectible 
factors considered in determining the amount of the reserve include the age of the receivable  the financial condition of the customer  general business  economic and political conditions  and other relevant facts and circumstances 
unexpected changes in the aforementioned factors would result in materially different amounts for this item 
in addition  results could be materially different if economic conditions worsened for the company s customers 
based on bad debt write offs  a increase or decrease in bad debt write offs would have had an impact of less than million 
recent developments on march   the company issued a press release stating in relevant part 
the company 



today released a preliminary estimate of fully diluted earnings per share eps for fiscal within the range of to 
the company s preliminary eps estimate is driven by its forecast of wholesale customer orders for fiscal to be down approximately to compared to orders received in fiscal wholesale customer orders through the first eleven weeks ended march  have decreased compared to the same period in commenting on the preliminary eps estimate and wholesale order forecast  susan engel  chairwoman and chief executive officer  said  our estimate today is highly preliminary in that it is based mainly on current orders from gift and specialty accounts 
over the past few years we have seen a gradual shift toward retailers reducing their initial orders and placing more re orders and we believe that this trend is continuing this year 
the company s first quarter order input in fiscal represented of total net wholesale orders for that year  by comparison  first quarter orders in fiscal and averaged 
in addition  the company also stated that the implementation of a needed restructuring within its wholesale sales force at the end of changed the mix and identity of account assignments for many of its sales representatives 
this change has been an additional factor that has delayed order input from some of its gift and specialty retail accounts 
ms 
engel also stated  as we have previously discussed  our strategies for growth include revenue generation from initiatives such as the time to celebrate party plan business and our simple traditions program for mid tier general merchandise retailers 
we foresee that this increased diversification in the company s business model will affect our ability to provide early guidance to investors 
furthermore  as we expect our retail segment to be a significant contributor to sales and earnings  our results will be dependent on our fourth quarter performance  particularly with a planned return this year of geppeddo to its historic levels of profitability 
page on the initial wholesale order input ms 
engel noted  we are coming off of several difficult years for the gift and specialty retail channel 
signs from last year suggest that attrition in the number of accounts in this channel albeit continuing has moderated meaningfully 
we were pleased to realize in a net gain in the number of our general giftware accounts and a slowing in the attrition of collectible customers over s metrics 
for this year  ms 
engel continued  anecdotal feedback indicates that the channel is continuing to take a cautious approach in given the current state of the economy  consumer confidence levels and geo political uncertainty 
our retailers have also expressed their growing confidence in our ability to accept and fill orders later in the year  which enables them to defer some of their purchase commitments until they have better clarity on consumer demand

approximately of the company s sales were denominated in foreign currencies that were subject to changes in exchange rates 
the company imports its product from manufacturers located in the pacific rim  principally china 
although the company generally pays for its product in united states dollars  the cost of such product may fluctuate with the value of the chinese currency because the purchase price paid to the company s vendors in united states dollars would be worth page more or less in the chinese currency 
as a result  the company s costs could be adversely affected if the chinese currency appreciates significantly relative to the united states dollar 
conversely  its costs would be favorably affected if the chinese currency depreciates significantly relative to the united states dollar 
in addition  the company purchased less than of its product from taiwan republic of china in these purchases were denominated in new taiwan dollars and were subject to changes in exchange rates
