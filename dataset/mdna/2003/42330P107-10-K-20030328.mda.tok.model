item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview oil and gas prices  the offshore mobile rig count  and deepwater construction activity are three of the primary indicators we use to forecast the future performance of our business 
our construction services generally follow successful drilling activities by six to eighteen months on the ocs and twelve months or longer in the deepwater arena 
the level of drilling activity is related to both short and long term trends in oil and gas prices 
in the second quarter of  oil prices reached their highest levels since the first gulf war and natural gas prices reached per mcf in early  pushing offshore mobile rig utilization rates back to virtually full utilization 
however  a slowing world economy and record levels of natural gas in storage resulted in significantly lower offshore mobile rig utilization rates in the second half of and throughout commodity prices have recently recovered to very robust levels  however  with the instability in the middle east and a slow world economy  drilling activity has yet to respond 
our primary leading indicator  the number of offshore mobile rigs contracted  is currently at approximately rigs employed in the gulf of mexico  compared to during the first quarter of the deepwater gulf is principally being developed for oil  with the complexity of developing these reservoirs resulting in significant lead times to first production 
product prices impact our oil and gas operations in several respects 
we seek to acquire producing oil and gas properties that are generally in the later stages of their economic life 
the sellers potential abandonment liabilities are a significant consideration with respect to the offshore properties we have purchased to date 
although higher natural gas prices tend to reduce the number of mature properties available for sale  these higher prices typically contribute to improved operating results for ert 
in contrast  lower natural gas prices  typically contribute to lower operating results for ert and a general increase in the number of mature properties available for sale 
we have expanded the scope of our gas and oil operations by taking a working interest in gunnison  a deepwater gulf development of kerr mcgee oil gas corporation which has discovered significant reserves  and participating in the ownership of the marco polo production facility 
vessel utilization is historically lower during the first quarter due to winter weather conditions in the gulf and the north sea 
accordingly  we plan our drydock inspections and other routine and preventive maintenance programs during this period 
during the first quarter  a substantial number of our customers finalize capital budgets and solicit bids for construction projects 
the bid and award process during the first two quarters typically leads to the commencement of construction activities during the second and third quarters 
as a result  we have historically generated up to of our marine contracting revenues in the last six months of the year 
our operations can also be severely impacted by weather during the fourth quarter 
our salvage barge  which has a shallow draft  is particularly sensitive to adverse weather conditions  and its utilization rate tends to be lower during such periods 
operation of oil and gas properties and production facilities tends to offset the impact of weather since the first and fourth quarters are typically periods of high demand and strong prices for natural gas 
due to this seasonality  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
the following table sets forth for the periods presented average us natural gas prices  our equivalent natural gas production  the average number of offshore rigs under contract in the gulf  the number of platforms installed and removed in the gulf and the vessel utilization rates for each of the major categories of our fleet

source offshore data services  installation and removal of platforms with two or more piles in the gulf 
average vessel utilization rate is calculated by dividing the total number of days the vessels in this category generated revenues by the total number of days in each quarter 
critical accounting policies our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of our business segments and or our customers 
we believe the most critical accounting policies in this regard are the estimation of revenue allowance on gross amounts billed and evaluation of recoverability of property and equipment and goodwill balances 
while these issues require us to make judgments that are somewhat subjective  they are generally based on a significant amount of historical data and current market data 
another area which requires us to make subjective judgments is that of revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived from billings under contracts  which are typically of short duration  that provide for either lump sum turnkey charges or specific time  material and equipment charges which are billed in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
we recognize revenue as it is earned at estimated collectible amounts 
revenue on significant turnkey contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are revised 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
ert acquisitions of producing offshore properties are recorded at the fair value exchanged at closing together with an estimate of its proportionate share of the undiscounted decommissioning liability assumed in the purchase based upon its working interest ownership percentage 
in estimating the decommissioning liability assumed in offshore property acquisitions  we perform detailed estimating procedures  including engineering studies 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our interests in oil and gas properties 
under the successful efforts method  the costs of successful wells and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized 
costs incurred to drill and equip development wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized 
the company also considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical to the preparation of its financial statements goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles sfas no 
 the company tests for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives on at least an annual basis 
the company s goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of the company s reporting units  as defined under sfas no 
 with its carrying amount 
the company s indefinite lived asset impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of the intangible and its carrying value 
the fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and other market related valuation models  such as earnings multiples and comparable asset market values 
these tests are influenced significantly by management estimates of future cash flows and the related expected utilization of assets 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over years 
in conjunction with the adoption of this statement  the company has discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
property and equipment property and equipment  both owned and under capital leases  are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided primarily on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 long lived assets  excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  to be held and used by the company are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
sfas no 
modifies sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 

for long lived assets to be held and used  the company bases its evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that my be present 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the company determines whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
if an impairment has occurred  the company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  is based on management s estimate of discounted cash flows 
assets are classified as held for sale when the company has a plan for disposal of certain assets and those assets meet the held for sale criteria of sfas no 
foreign currency the functional currency for the company s foreign subsidiary well ops uk limited is the applicable local currency british pound 
results of operations for this subsidiary are translated into us dollars using average exchange rates during the period 
assets and liabilities of this foreign subsidiary are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and the resulting translation adjustment which was a gain of million  net of taxes  in is accumulated as a component of shareholders equity 
all foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized currently in the statements of operations 
canyon offshore  the company s rov subsidiary  has operations in the united kingdom and southeast asia sectors 
canyon conducts the majority of its affairs in these regions in us dollars which it considers the functional currency 
when currencies other than the us dollar are to be paid or received the resulting gain or loss from translation is recognized in the statements of operations 
these amounts for the year ended december  were not material to the company s results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for price risk management activities the company s price risk management activities involve the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge the impact of market price risk exposures primarily related to our oil and gas production 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  all derivatives are reflected in our balance sheet at their fair market value 
under sfas no 
there are two types of hedging activities hedges of cash flow exposure and hedges of fair value exposure 
the company engages primarily in cash flow hedges 
hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into to hedge a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred to the extent that they are effective and are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge s change in value is recognized immediately in earnings in oil and gas production revenues 
as required by sfas no 
 we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions and our methods for assessing and testing correlation and hedge ineffectiveness 
all hedging instruments are linked to the hedged asset  liability  firm commitment or forecasted transaction 
we also assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in our hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items 
we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge 
the market value of hedging instruments reflects our best estimate and is based upon exchange or over the counter quotations whenever they are available 
quoted valuations may not be available due to location differences or terms that extend beyond the period for which quotations are available 
where quotes are not available  we utilize other valuation techniques or models to estimate market values 
these modeling techniques require us to make estimations of future prices  price correlation and market volatility and liquidity 
our actual results may differ from our estimates  and these differences can be positive or negative 
during the second half of  the company entered into various cash flow hedging swap contracts to fix cash flows relating to a portion of the company s oil and gas production 
all of these qualified for hedge accounting and none extended beyond a year and a half 
the aggregate fair market value of the swaps was a liability of million as of december  the company recorded million of loss  net of taxes  in other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity as these hedges were highly effective 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb released sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is required to be adopted no later than january  sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting obligations and retirement costs related to the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
among other things  sfas will require oil and gas companies to reflect decommissioning liabilities on the face of the balance sheet at fair value on a discounted basis 
historically  ert has reflected this liability on the balance sheet on an undiscounted basis 
the company will adopt this standard  as required  effective january  management currently believes adoption of this standard will result in additional diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of of between and 
and adjustments to certain balance sheet accounts including a decrease in decommissioning liabilities of approximately million due to discounting 
in november  fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin no 
was issued 
fin no 
requires a guarantor to recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin no 
also expands the disclosures required to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified 
the disclosure requirements are effective immediately 
the company does not expect fin no 
to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in january  fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities was issued which requires that companies that control another entity through interests other than voting interests should consolidate the controlled entity 
fin no 
applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and applies in the first interim period beginning after june  to variable interest entities created before february  the related disclosure requirements are effective immediately 
the company does not believe that the adoption of this interpretation will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
results of operations comparison of years ended and revenues 
during the year ended december   the company s revenues increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  with the subsea and salvage segment contributing all of the increase 
subsea and salvage revenues increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the prior year 
our acquisitions of canyon offshore and well ops uk ltd added million and million  respectively 
the remainder of the increase is due to the addition of three deepwater construction vessels the q  the intrepid and the eclipse 
oil and gas production revenue for the year ended december  decreased less than to million from million during the prior year 
an increase in production  lead by the significant shell and hess acquisitions made late in the third quarter of  was offset by lower average realized commodity prices 
oil and gas production increased to bcfe in from bcfe during  while our average realized commodity price declined to per mcfe per mcf of natural gas and per barrel of oil in as compared to per mcfe per mcf of natural gas and per barrel of oil in the prior year 
oil and condensate represented of ert revenue in compared to in gross profit 
gross profit of million for the year ended december  was million  or  below the million gross profit recorded in the prior year with both segments contributing to the decline 
subsea and salvage gross profit decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during our dp vessels generated million of gross profit  only of the million generated in the prior year  due in part to the charges recorded in the fourth quarter related to a contract dispute 
margins for this segment decreased to for the year ended december  compared to in while aquatica margins held strong at due to a large amount of shelf repair work following hurricane lili  the dp fleet only contributed margins in compared to in the prior year 
oil and gas production gross profit decreased million from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due mainly to the aforementioned decrease in average realized commodity prices 
margins declined to during from during due to platform repairs and the time necessary for pipelines to return to full production following hurricane lili 
selling and administrative expenses

and a charge taken for the settlement of litigation in the fourth quarter of net interest income expense and other 
the company reported net interest expense and other of million for the year ended december  in contrast to million for the prior year 
this increase is due to the increase in debt from our capital program  which resulted in an additional million in interest expense  offset by a million gain on our foreign currency hedge related to the well ops uk limited acquisition included in other income in the third quarter of income taxes 
income taxes decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year due to decreased profitability 
federal income taxes were provided at the statutory rate of in however  our deduction of q construction costs as research and development expenditures for federal tax purposes resulted in cdi paying no federal income taxes in and since the deduction of q construction costs affects financial and taxable income in different years  the entire and provisions for federal taxes were reflected as deferred income taxes

net income of million for the year ended december  was million  or  less than the million earned in as a result of factors described above 
comparison of year ended december  and revenues 
during the year ended december   the company s revenues increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  with the subsea and salvage segment contributing all of the increase 
aquatica revenues increased to million for from million in the prior year due  in part  to added capacity as a result of our acquisition of professional divers of new orleans  inc in february and improved ocs activity 
revenues generated from our dp fleet increased to million during compared to million in due mainly to vessel utilization improving from during to 
this increased utility reflects improved cdi market share  an expansion in the scope of deepwater services provided and expansion into other regions mexico and trinidad 
oil and gas production revenue for the year ended december  decreased to million from million during the prior year due to a decrease in production from bcfe in compared to bcfe during ert received an average of per mcf for natural gas and per bbl for oil during compared to per mcf and per bbl in oil and condensate represented of ert s revenues in versus in gross profit 
gross profit of million for the year ended december  was greater than the million gross profit recorded in the prior year with subsea and salvage contracting gross profit providing all of the increase and offsetting a million decline in oil and gas production gross profit 
subsea and salvage margins improved from for the year ended december  to during the year ended december  due mainly to the increase in utilization due to increased marine construction activity  even though we earned only margins on million of nansen boomvang volume that was mostly pass through revenue 
oil and gas production gross profit decreased million from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due mainly to the aforementioned decline in production  higher amortization rates in than and a million charge for accounts receivable exposure related to the enron bankruptcy 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were million in  which is relatively flat increase with the million incurred during given the increased revenues  this tight cost control provided a two point margin improvement ie  margin for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  net interest income expense and other 
the company reported net interest expense and other of million for the year ended december  in contrast to  for the prior year as average cash balances net of marad financing declined during as compared to due mainly to costs associated with construction of the q and the intrepid conversion 
income taxes

net income 
net income of million for the year ended december  was million  or  more than as a result of factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources during the three years following our initial public offering in  internally generated cash flow funded approximately million of capital expenditures and enabled us to remain essentially debt free

in january  we acquired canyon offshore  inc  in july we acquired the well operations business unit of technip coflexip and in august  ert made two significant property acquisitions see further discussion below 
these acquisitions have significantly increased our debt to total book capitalization ratio from at december  to at december  additionally  increased operations coupled with depressed market conditions have caused our working capital to decrease from million at december  to million at december  in order to reduce this leverage  on january   cdi completed the private placement of million of a newly designated class of cumulated convertible preferred stock series a cumulative convertible preferred stock  par value per share which is convertible into  shares of cal dive common stock at per share 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during this decrease was due mainly to decreased profitability and to last year s collection of a million tax refund from the internal revenue service relating to the deduction of q construction costs as research and development expenditures for federal tax purposes 
depreciation and amortization also increased million to million due to the depreciation of new vessels placed in service during and to increased depletion related to increased production levels from ert 
this was offset by an increase in funding required for accounts receivable collections during compared to net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during this increase was due mainly to increased profitability and collection of the million tax refund from the internal revenue service noted above 
timing of accounts payable payments provided million of the increase due mainly to expenses accrued at december  on the nansen boomvang project which carries a large component of pass through costs 
this project also accounted for the significant increase in unbilled revenue at december  million versus million at december   as the next scheduled invoicing milestone was achieved in january this was offset by a million decrease in funding from accounts receivable collections during compared to as we have extended payment terms to horizon offshore 
in addition  depreciation and amortization increased million to million for due mainly to the depreciation of newly acquired vessels in service 
investing activities 
capital expenditures have consisted principally of strategic asset acquisitions related to the purchase of dp vessels  the eclipse and mystic viking  construction of the q and conversion of the intrepid  acquisition of aquatica  professional divers  canyon offshore  inc and well ops uk limited  improvements to existing vessels and the acquisition of oil and gas properties

cal dive s share of such project development costs is estimated in a range of million to million million of which had been incurred by december  with over half of that for construction of the spar 
see footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein for discussion of financing relating to the spar construction 
financing activities 
we have financed seasonal operating requirements and capital expenditures with internally generated funds  borrowings under credit facilities  the sale of common stock and project financings 
in august  we closed a million long term financing for construction of the q in january  the maritime administration agreed to expand the facility to million to include the modifications to the vessel which had been approved during during and  we borrowed million and million  respectively  on this facility bringing the total to million at december  the marad debt is payable in equal semi annual installments beginning in august and maturing years from such date 
it is collateralized by the q  with cal dive guaranteeing of the debt  and bears an interest rate which currently floats at a rate approximating aaa commercial paper yields plus basis points approximately as of december  
for a period up to ten years from delivery of the vessel in april  the company has options to lock in a fixed rate 
in accordance with the marad debt agreements  we are required to comply with certain covenants and restrictions  including the maintenance of minimum net worth  working capital and debt to equity requirements 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
the company has a revolving credit facility which was increased from million to million during and the term extended for three years 
this facility is collateralized by accounts receivable and most of the remaining vessel fleet  bears interest at libor plus basis points depending on cdi leverage ratios approximately as of december  and  among other restrictions  includes three financial covenants cash flow leverage  minimum interest coverage and fixed charge coverage

accrued interest cost on the outstanding balance is capitalized to the cost of the facility during construction and is payable monthly thereafter 
in august  cdi acquired of the equity of the entity and converted the notes into a term loan gunnison term loan 
the total commitment of the loan was reduced to million and will be payable in quarterly installments of million for three years after delivery of the spar with the remaining million due at the end of the three years

in may  cdi sold million shares of primary common stock for per share  along with  additional shares to cover over allotments 
net proceeds to the company of approximately million were used for the coflexip well operation acquisition  ert acquisitions and to retire debt under the company s revolving line of credit 
during  we made payments of million on capital leases assumed in the canyon acquisition 
the only other financing activity during  and involved the exercise of employee stock options 
in january  cdi completed the private placement of million of preferred stock which is convertible into  shares of cdi common stock at per share 
the preferred stock was issued to a private investment firm 
the preferred stock holder has the right to purchase as much as million in additional preferred stock for a period of two years beginning in july  the conversion price of the additional preferred stock will equal of the then prevailing price of cal dive common stock  subject to a minimum conversion price of per common share 
after the second anniversary  the holder may redeem the value of its original investments in the preferred shares to be settled in common stock or cash at the discretion of the company

in addition  in connection with our business strategy  we evaluate acquisition opportunities including additional vessels as well as interest in offshore natural gas and oil properties 
we believe that internally generated cash flow  borrowings under existing credit facilities and use of project financings along with other debt and equity alternatives will provide the necessary capital to meet these obligations and achieve our planned growth 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is currently exposed to market risk in two major areas commodity prices and foreign currency 
because all of the company s debt at december  was based on floating rates  changes in interest would  assuming all other things equal  have a minimal impact on the fair market value of the debt instruments 
assuming december  debt levels  every basis points move in interest rates would result in million of annualized interest expense or savings  as the case may be  to the company 
commodity price risk the company has utilized derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of and oil and gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing its exposure to price fluctuations
