item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of continuing operations the results of continuing operations reflect primarily the results of minntech including medivators and carsen 
reference is made to i the impact on the company s results of operations of a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar during fiscal  compared with fiscal increase in value of approximately during  as compared to fiscal  based upon average exchange rates  ii the impact on the company s results of operations of a stronger euro against the united states dollar during fiscal  compared with fiscal increase in value of approximately during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  based upon average exchange rates  iii critical accounting policies of the company  as more fully described elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  iv  additional shares issued in connection with a three for two stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid to stockholders in may  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  v the company s acquisition of minntech in september  as more fully described in item  business  and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  vi the merger of the company s medivators  inc subsidiary into minntech in november  which subsidiary accounted for the majority of the company s endoscope reprocessing business  and vii the company s acquisitions of biolab and mar cor in august  and dyped in september  as more fully described in item  business  and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
since the biolab  mar cor and dyped acquisitions occurred subsequent to the end of fiscal  these acquisitions had no impact upon the company s results of operations for any of the years presented 
minntech is reflected in the company s results of operations for fiscal and the portion of fiscal subsequent to its acquisition on september   and is not reflected in the results of operations for fiscal the acquisition of minntech added two new operating segments to the company  dialysis products and filtration and separation products 
additionally  minntech also contributes to the company s product service operating segment 
discussion herein of the company s pre existing businesses refers to the operations of cantel  carsen and medivators  but excluding the impact of the minntech acquisition 
the following table gives information as to the net sales and the percentage to the total net sales accounted for by each operating segment of the company 
year ended july  dollar amounts in thousands dialysis products   endoscopy and surgical products    endoscope reprocessing products    filtration and separation products   scientific products    product service    fiscal compared with fiscal net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal net sales contributed by minntech excluding medivators for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
net sales of the company s pre existing businesses increased by  or  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of carsen s net sales using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
carsen s net sales are principally included in the endoscopy and surgical  scientific and product service segments 
in addition  net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of minntech s netherlands subsidiary net sales using a stronger euro against the united states dollar 
the majority of the net sales of minntech s netherlands subsidiary are included in the dialysis segment 
increases in the price of the company s products during fiscal did not have a significant effect on net sales 
the increase in sales of the company s pre existing businesses was attributable to an increase in sales of scientific products  endoscope reprocessing products  product service and endoscopy and surgical products 
the increase in sales of scientific products was primarily due to an increase in volume of approximately for microscopy  imaging and industrial products 
the increase in sales of endoscope reprocessing products was primarily due to an increase in volume of approximately in the united states for endoscope disinfection equipment and related consumables 
the increase in sales of product service was primarily due to increased volume related to the increased field population of the company s endoscope disinfection equipment in the marketplace 
the increase in sales of endoscopy and surgical products was primarily due to the translation of carsen s net sales using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
sales of endoscopy and surgical products continue to be adversely impacted by healthcare funding issues in canada as well as intensified competition  which competition the company expects to continue 
healthcare funding in canada is dependent upon governmental appropriations 
although canada recently adopted a budget that provides for a significant increase in funding for diagnostic healthcare products  the company cannot ascertain what impact the funding situation or the new budget will have on future sales of endoscopy and surgical products 
additionally  the sale of endoscopy and surgical products during fiscal has been adversely impacted by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in the greater toronto area which prevented the company s sales personnel from visiting hospitals 
the company s endoscopy and surgical business could be materially and adversely affected by a future outbreak of sars in canada 
the company believes that it has the opportunity to continue increasing market share in all of its existing operating segments with the exception of the product service segment 
the majority of the company s existing product service segment excluding the additional product service revenue to be provided by biolab and mar cor in fiscal pertains to the servicing of flexible endoscopes in canada 
the company s market share in its flexible endoscope service business in canada is substantial  therefore  growth opportunities for its existing service business may be limited without the addition of new product servicing opportunities 
the increase in sales of the company s dialysis products and filtration and separation products is due to the inclusion of the minntech operations for the entire fiscal year  as compared to a partial period since the date of the acquisition for fiscal this increase in sales of dialysis products was partially offset by a decrease in volume of the company s renatron r reprocessing product 
this increase in sales of the company s filtration and separation products was partially offset by a decrease in volume of the company s hemofilters due to the loss of a major european distributor  as well as the decrease in volume of hemoconcentrators as a result of the medical community moving towards an alternative medical procedure that does not require the use of a hemoconcentrator 
if the company had owned minntech for the entire fiscal year  the decrease in volume of renatrons  hemofilters  and hemoconcentrators in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  would have been approximately   and  respectively 
the company does not expect sales of renatrons and hemofilters to increase in fiscal and anticipates a continuing decline in the sales of hemoconcentrators 
however  the company believes that overall sales of both dialysis products and filtration and separation products may increase during fiscal due to increased sales of other products within these segments 
gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal gross profit contributed by minntech excluding medivators for fiscal and was  and  respectively 
gross profit of the company s pre existing businesses increased by  or  to  for fiscal  from  in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared with for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of sales of the company s pre existing businesses for fiscal and was and  respectively 
during fiscal  gross profit of the company s pre existing businesses was adversely impacted by  in charges for warranty and slow moving inventory related to the company s endoscope reprocessing products  which charges were incurred predominantly in the second quarter 
the comparable amount of these charges in fiscal was approximately  therefore  the increase in these charges of  reduced gross profit percentage by for fiscal the company does not expect a level of warranty expense in the future similar to fiscal minntech s gross profit as a percentage of sales excluding medivators for fiscal and was and  respectively 
the lower gross profit percentage from the company s pre existing businesses for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  was primarily attributable to the charges for warranty and slow moving inventory related to the company s endoscope reprocessing products  sales mix as well as an increase in the cost to manufacture the current models of the company s endoscope reprocessing equipment  an increased cost structure in carsen s product service business to support anticipated increases in sales that did not occur  continued competition in endoscopy and surgical and scientific products  and manufacturing overhead associated with medivators relocation into minntech s facilities 
partially offsetting these decreases in gross profit percentage were favorable canadian dollar exchange rates which lowered carsen s cost of inventory purchased and therefore decreased cost of sales by approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal with respect to minntech  the decrease in gross profit percentage was due primarily to sales mix of dialysis products  particularly with respect to decreased sales of the renatron reprocessing product  as well as unfavorable overhead absorption 
partially offsetting these decreases in gross profit percentage was a  charge to cost of sales in fiscal related to the sale of inventories which carried a step up in value as a result of purchase accounting 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were for fiscal  compared with for fiscal the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and expanded marketing efforts at minntech to support worldwide sales  and the inclusion of the higher selling cost structure related to the minntech operations for the entire fiscal year  as compared to a partial period since the date of the acquisition for fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal  principally due to favorable adjustments in the amounts of  and  resulting from the settlement of liabilities initially recorded in conjunction with the minntech acquisition relating to sales tax and severance  respectively  efficiencies realized as a result of the minntech acquisition  including the subsequent relocation of the medivators operations into minntech s facilities  a decrease in bad debt expense due to significant charges incurred in the prior year  and a reduction in incentive compensation and the cost of employee benefit programs 
partially offsetting these decreases were the inclusion of the minntech operations for the entire fiscal year  as compared to a partial period since the date of the acquisition for fiscal  an increase in the cost of commercial insurance  foreign exchange losses associated with translating certain foreign denominated assets into functional currencies  and a  pre acquisition workers compensation claim that was recently assessed on the company by the state of minnesota due to the bankruptcy of minntech s former insurance carrier 
research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs increased by  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal  principally due to expanded activities in minntech s including medivators dialysis  filtration and separation  and endoscope reprocessing segments  as well as the inclusion of the minntech operations for the entire fiscal year  as compared to a partial period since the date of the acquisition for fiscal interest expense decreased by  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal  as a result of lower average outstanding borrowings and lower interest rates during fiscal additionally  during fiscal there was a  write off of fees in connection with a prior credit facility 
partially offsetting these decreases were outstanding borrowings under the company s credit facilities for the entire fiscal year  as compared to a partial period since the date of the acquisition for fiscal income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal the consolidated effective tax rate on operations was and for fiscal and  respectively 
in conjunction with the purchase accounting for the acquisition of minntech  cantel eliminated the valuation allowances previously existing against its deferred tax assets related to the federal net operating loss carryforwards nols accumulated in the united states 
therefore  for all periods subsequent to september   the company has provided in its results of operations income tax expense for its united states operations at the statutory tax rate  however  actual payment of us federal income taxes reflects the benefits of the utilization of the nols 
at july   such nols were approximately  the company s results of operations for fiscal and also reflect income tax expense for its international subsidiaries at their respective statutory rates 
the company s international subsidiaries in canada  the netherlands and japan had effective tax rates during fiscal of approximately  and  respectively 
the lower overall effective tax rate for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is principally due to the geographic mix of pretax income  a reduction in the canadian statutory tax rate  and an overall reduction in the estimated us state tax rate 
for fiscal  the company s overall tax rate is expected to be primarily affected by the geographic mix of pretax income 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal net sales contributed by minntech excluding medivators for fiscal were  without the minntech acquisition  net sales of the company s pre existing businesses would have decreased by  or  to  for fiscal net sales were adversely impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of carsen s net sales using a weaker canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
the decrease in sales of the company s pre existing businesses was attributable to the decreased sales of endoscopy and surgical products  partially offset by an increase in sales of endoscope reprocessing products and product service 
the decrease in sales of endoscopy and surgical products was due to a decrease in demand  including the adverse impact of healthcare funding issues in canada as well as intensified competition which the company expects to continue 
healthcare funding in canada is dependent upon governmental appropriations and the company cannot ascertain what impact the funding situation will have on future sales of endoscopy and surgical products and scientific products 
the increase in sales of endoscope reprocessing products was primarily due to an increase in demand in the united states 
the increase in sales of product service was primarily due to an increase in demand and market share in canada 
the company believes that it has the opportunity to continue increasing its market share in the endoscope reprocessing segment 
the majority of its product service segment is located in canada where the company s market share in its flexible endoscope service business is substantial  therefore  growth opportunities for its existing service business may be limited without the addition of new product servicing opportunities 
gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal gross profit contributed by minntech excluding medivators for fiscal was  without the impact of the minntech acquisition  gross profit of the company s pre existing businesses would have decreased by  or  to  for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal during fiscal  gross profit was adversely impacted by a  charge to cost of sales related to the sale of inventories which carried a step up in value recorded as a result of purchase accounting  such charge reduced gross profit percentage by for fiscal minntech s excluding medivators gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for fiscal  without the impact of the minntech acquisition  gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal would have been 
the lower gross profit percentage from the company s pre existing businesses for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  was primarily attributable to the adverse impact of a weaker canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar  since the company s canadian subsidiary purchases substantially all of its products in united states dollars and sells its products in canadian dollars  a higher gross profit percentage in due to a buy in of endoscopes prior to receiving a supplier price increase such endoscopes were sold during fiscal  increased competition in endoscopy and surgical products  and sales mix associated with endoscope reprocessing products and product service  including the increased manufacturing and warranty costs associated with the company s new dsd endoscope reprocessing unit 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were for fiscal  compared with for fiscal without the impact of the minntech acquisition  selling expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been for fiscal the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales from the company s pre existing businesses was primarily attributable to lower than expected sales at carsen  an increase in personnel at carsen and expanded marketing efforts to support medivators domestic sales of endoscope reprocessing products 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal general and administrative expenses incurred by minntech excluding medivators for fiscal were  without the minntech acquisition  general and administrative expenses of the company s pre existing businesses would have increased by  for fiscal  principally due to the addition of business development personnel and related expenses and costs associated with the company s listing of its common stock on the new york stock exchange 
research and development expenses increased by  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal research and development expenses incurred by minntech excluding medivators for fiscal were  without the minntech acquisition  research and development expenses of the company s pre existing businesses would have increased by  for fiscal  principally due to costs related to medivators new endoscope reprocessing unit 
the company anticipates research and development expenses to increase in fiscal primarily due to costs associated with two specific projects  however  such increase is not expected to exceed relative to the fiscal level of research and development expenses assuming that minntech had been included in the company s results of operations for all of fiscal 
interest expense was  for fiscal  compared with interest income of  for fiscal this change in interest was attributable to the company s borrowings under its new credit facilities entered into during september to fund a portion of the minntech acquisition 
income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by  or  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal the consolidated effective tax rate on operations was and for fiscal and  respectively 
in conjunction with the purchase accounting for the acquisition of minntech  cantel eliminated the valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets related to the nols accumulated in the united states 
therefore  for all periods subsequent to september   the company has provided in its results of operations income tax expense for its united states operations at the statutory tax rate  however  actual payment of us federal income taxes will reflect the benefits of the utilization of the nols 
the company s results of operations for fiscal also reflect income tax expense for its international subsidiaries at their respective statutory rates 
the company s international subsidiaries in canada  the netherlands and japan had effective tax rates during fiscal of approximately  and  respectively 
the operations of the company s subsidiaries in the netherlands and japan were part of the minntech acquisition and are therefore included in the company s results of operations only since september  for fiscal  income taxes consist primarily of taxes imposed on the company s canadian subsidiary which had an effective tax rate of approximately 
the consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal was lower than the canadian effective tax rate due to the fact that income generated by the united states operations was substantially offset by federal tax benefits resulting from the utilization of nols 
in fiscal  the company expects a reduction in its canadian effective tax rate due to enacted reductions in both canadian federal and provincial income tax rates 
however  the company s overall effective tax rate for fiscal is subject to the progressive tax rate structure in the netherlands  as well as changes caused by the geographic mix of pretax income 
liquidity and capital resources at july   the company s working capital was  compared with  at july  this increase primarily reflects increases in cash and cash equivalents and decreases in accrued expenses and income taxes payable 
cash and cash equivalents increased due to earnings generated from continuing operations  partially offset by repayments under the company s us credit facilities  as indicated on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
accrued expenses decreased due primarily to the settlement of liabilities initially recorded in conjunction with the minntech acquisition  including an accrual for sales and use taxes 
income taxes decreased due to geographic mix and the timing of tax payments 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively

net cash used in investing activities was  and  in fiscal and  respectively  as compared with net cash provided by investing activities of  in fiscal in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily for capital expenditures 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily for the acquisition of minntech and capital expenditures 
in fiscal  net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to proceeds from discontinued operations  partially offset by purchases of available for sale securities  professional fees related to the minntech acquisition such fees are included within other  net and capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal  compared with net cash provided by financing activities of  in fiscal and  in fiscal in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to repayments under the company s credit facilities 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to borrowings under the company s credit facilities for the minntech acquisition  net of related debt issuance costs  partially offset by repayments under these credit facilities 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to proceeds from exercises of stock options 
in conjunction with the acquisition of minntech on september   the company entered into credit facilities to fund the financed portion of the cash consideration paid in the merger and costs associated with the merger  as well as to replace the company s existing working capital credit facilities 
such credit facilities included i a  senior secured amortizing term loan facility from a consortium of us lenders the term loan facility used by cantel to finance a portion of the minntech acquisition  ii a  senior secured revolving credit facility from the us lenders the us revolving credit facility used by cantel to finance a portion of the minntech acquisition as well as being available for future working capital requirements for the us businesses of cantel  including minntech cantel and minntech are referred to as the us borrowers the term loan facility and the us revolving credit facility are collectively referred to as the us credit facilities  and iii a  united states dollars senior secured revolving credit facility for carsen the canadian borrower with a canadian bank the canadian revolving credit facility available for carsen s future working capital requirements the us credit facilities and the canadian revolving credit facility are collectively referred to as the credit facilities 
in conjunction with the acquisitions of biolab and mar cor on august   the company amended its credit facilities as follows i outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility were reset to  to finance a portion of the mar cor acquisition  ii mar cor was added as a guarantor under the us credit facilities and the stock and assets of mar cor were pledged as security for such guaranty  iii the canadian revolving credit facility was increased from  to  iv biolab was added as a guarantor under the canadian revolving credit facility and the stock and assets of biolab were pledged as security for such guaranty  v the maturity dates of the us credit facilities were extended to march   vi certain financial covenants of the credit facilities were modified to reflect the effect of the acquisitions in the company s anticipated future operating results and vii the company was permitted to guarantee the lease on mar cor s facility 
the maturity date of the canadian revolving credit facility remains september  borrowings under the credit facilities bear interest at rates ranging from 
to above the lenders base rate  or at rates ranging from to above libor  depending upon the company s consolidated ratio of debt to ebitda 
the base rates associated with the us lenders and the canadian lender were and  respectively  at july   and the libor rates ranged from to at july  the margins applicable to the company s outstanding borrowings at july  were above the lenders base rate and above libor 
at july   all of the company s outstanding borrowings were under libor contracts 
in order to protect its interest rate exposure  the company entered into a three year interest rate cap agreement expiring on september  covering  of borrowings under the term loan facility  which caps libor on this portion of outstanding borrowings at 
the credit facilities also provide for fees on the unused portion of such facilities at rates ranging from 
to  depending upon the company s consolidated ratio of debt to ebitda 
the us credit facilities provide for available borrowings based upon percentages of the eligible accounts receivable and inventories of cantel  minntech and mar cor  require the us borrowers to meet certain financial covenants  are secured by substantially all assets of the us borrowers and mar cor including a pledge of the stock of minntech and mar cor owned by cantel and of the outstanding shares of carsen and biolab stock owned by cantel  and are guaranteed by minntech and mar cor 
as of july   the company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the term loan facility and the us revolving credit facility  as amended on august  the canadian revolving credit facility provides for available borrowings based upon percentages of the eligible accounts receivable and inventories of carsen and biolab  requires the canadian borrower to meet certain financial covenants  and is secured by substantially all assets of the canadian borrower and biolab 
as of july   carsen was in compliance with the financial covenants under the canadian revolving credit facility  as amended on august  on september   the company borrowed  under the term loan facility and  under the us revolving credit facility in connection with the acquisition of minntech 
at july   the company had  outstanding under the term loan facility and had no outstanding borrowings under either the us revolving credit facility or the canadian revolving credit facility 
in conjunction with the mar cor acquisition on august   the company borrowed an additional  therefore  immediately after such acquisition  the company had  outstanding under the us credit facilities  including  under the term loan facility 
the biolab acquisition did not require any borrowings under the canadian revolving credit facility 
amounts repaid by the company under the term loan facility may not be re borrowed 
aggregate annual required maturities of the credit facilities over the next five years and thereafter are as follows year ending july  thereafter total  all of such maturing amounts reflect the repayment terms under the credit facilities  as amended on august  the amount maturing in fiscal includes the  currently outstanding under the us revolving credit facility since such amount is required to be repaid prior to the expiration date of this facility 
aggregate future minimum rental commitments at july  exclusive of biolab  mar cor  and dyped under operating leases for property and equipment are as follows year ending july  thereafter total rental commitments  the majority of carsen s sales of endoscopy and surgical products and scientific products related to microscopy have been made pursuant to the olympus agreement  and the majority of carsen s sales of scientific products related to industrial technology equipment have been made pursuant to the olympus industrial agreement  under which carsen has been granted the exclusive right to distribute the covered olympus products in canada 
both agreements expire on march  carsen is subject to a minimum purchase requirement under the olympus agreement of approximately million during the contract year ending march  for the contract year ended march   carsen satisfied the minimum purchase requirement under the olympus agreement 
if carsen fulfills its obligations under the olympus agreement  the parties will establish new minimum purchase requirements and extend the olympus agreement through march  the medivators agreement expired on august   but was extended until november   under which olympus is granted the exclusive right to distribute the majority of the company s endoscope reprocessing products and related accessories and supplies in the united states and puerto rico 
minntech and olympus have reached an agreement in principle to renew this distribution agreement for three years on substantially similar terms and expect to execute a formal agreement shortly 
the medivators agreement provides for minimum purchase projections 
failure by olympus to achieve of the minimum purchase projections in any contract year gives minntech the option to terminate the medivators agreement 
the company has determined that it will repatriate minimal amounts of existing and future accumulated profits from its international locations until existing nols are exhausted  which the company estimates to be no earlier than fiscal notwithstanding this strategy  the company believes that its current cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations  including its us operations and the funds available under its revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy the company s cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon its existing operations  including the acquisitions of biolab  mar cor and dyped 
at october   approximately  was available under the revolving credit facilities 
during fiscal compared with fiscal  the average value of the canadian dollar increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar affect the company s results of operations because the company s canadian subsidiary purchases substantially all of its products in united states dollars and sells its products in canadian dollars 
during fiscal  such strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar had a positive impact upon the company s results of operations 
such currency fluctuations also result in a corresponding change in the united states dollar value of the company s assets that are denominated in canadian dollars 
under the canadian revolving credit facility  carsen has a  united states dollars foreign currency hedging facility which is available to hedge against the impact of such currency fluctuations on purchases of inventories 
total commitments for foreign currency forward contracts under this facility amounted to  united states dollars at october  and cover approximately of carsen s projected purchases of inventories through july these foreign currency forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedge instruments 
the weighted average exchange rate of the forward contracts open at october  was canadian dollar per united states dollar  or 
united states dollar per canadian dollar 
the exchange rate published by the wall street journal on october  was canadian dollar per united states dollar  or 
united states dollar per canadian dollar 
during fiscal compared with fiscal  the value of the euro increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar affect the company s results of operations because a portion of the net assets of minntech s netherlands subsidiary are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars but must be converted into its functional euro currency 
during fiscal  such strengthening of the euro relative to the united states dollar had an adverse impact upon the company s overall results of operations 
such currency fluctuations also result in a change in the united states dollar value of the company s assets that are denominated in euros 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar  the company enters into short term contracts to purchase euros forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts have been designated as fair value hedges 
there was one foreign currency forward contract amounting to euro  at october  which covers certain assets and liabilities of minntech s netherlands subsidiary which are denominated in currencies other than its functional currency 
such contract expires on october  under its credit facilities  such contracts to purchase euros may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  all of the company s foreign currency forward contracts are designated as hedges 
recognition of gains and losses related to the canadian hedges is deferred within other comprehensive income until settlement of the underlying commitments  and realized gains and losses are recorded within cost of sales upon settlement 
gains and losses related to the hedging contracts to buy euros forward are immediately realized within general and administrative expenses due to the short term nature of such contracts 
for purposes of translating the balance sheet  at july  compared to july   the value of the canadian dollar and the value of the euro increased by approximately and  respectively  compared to the value of the united states dollar 
the total of these currency movements resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of  for fiscal  thereby increasing stockholders equity 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar during fiscal and did not have a significant impact upon either the company s results of operations or the translation of the balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that the company s japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  earnings and net assets 
inflation has not significantly impacted the company s operations 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company continually evaluates its estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
with respect to the fiscal acquisitions of biolab  mar cor and dyped  the company is currently in the process of reviewing and evaluating their critical accounting policies 
based upon the completion of this process  the company may need to enhance its future disclosure to capture all critical accounting policies for these acquired companies 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales excluding certain sales of endoscope reprocessing equipment in the united states is recognized as products are shipped to customers and title passes 
the passing of title is determined based upon the fob terms specified for each shipment 
with respect to dialysis  filtration and separation and a portion of endoscope reprocessing products  shipment terms are generally fob origin for common carrier and fob destination when the company s distribution fleet is utilized 
with respect to endoscopy and surgical and scientific products  shipment terms may be either fob origin or destination 
customer acceptance for the majority of the company s product sales occurs at the time of delivery 
in certain instances  primarily with respect to an insignificant amount of the company s sales of dialysis equipment and scientific products  post delivery obligations such as installation  in servicing or training are contractually specified  in such instances  revenue recognition is deferred until all of such conditions have been substantially fulfilled such that the products are deemed functional by the end user 
with respect to a portion of endoscopy and surgical and scientific product sales  equipment is sold as part of a system for which the equipment is functionally interdependent or the customer s purchase order specifies ship complete as a condition of delivery  revenue recognition on such sales is deferred until all equipment has been delivered 
sales of a majority of the company s endoscope reprocessing equipment to a third party distributor in the united states are recognized on a bill and hold basis 
such sales satisfy each of the following criteria i the risks of ownership have passed to the third party distributor  ii the third party distributor must provide a written purchase order committing to the purchase of specified units  iii the bill and hold arrangement was specifically requested by the third party distributor for the purpose of minimizing the impact of multiple shipments of the units  iv the third party distributor provides specific instructions for shipment to customers  and completed units held by the company for the third party distributor generally do not exceed three months of anticipated shipments  v the company has no further performance obligations with respect to such units  vi completed units are invoiced to the third party distributor with day payment terms and such receivables are generally satisfied within such terms  and vii completed units are ready for shipment and segregated in a designated section of the company s warehouse reserved only for the third party distributor 
revenue on service sales is recognized when repairs are completed and the products are shipped to customers 
all shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers  such as freight  are recorded as revenue and related costs are included within costs of sales at the time the sale is recognized 
none of the company s sales  including the bill and hold sales arrangement  contain right of return provisions  and customer claims for credit or return due to damage  defect  shortage or other reason must be pre approved by the company before credit is issued or such product is accepted for return 
no cash discounts for early payment are offered except with respect to a small portion of the company s sales of dialysis products 
price protection is not offered by the company  although advance pricing contracts or required notice periods prior to implementation of price increases exist for certain customers with respect to many of the company s products 
with respect to certain of the company s dialysis product customers  volume rebates and trade in allowances are provided  such volume rebates and trade in allowances are provided for as a reduction of sales at the time of revenue recognition 
the majority of the company s dialysis products are sold to end users  the majority of filtration and separation and endoscope reprocessing products are sold to third party distributors  the majority of endoscopy and surgical products are sold directly to hospitals  scientific products are sold to both hospitals and other end users  and product service is sold to hospitals  third party distributors and other end users 
sales to all of these customers follow the company s revenue recognition policies 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due to the company from normal business activities 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the company uses historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist of products which are sold in the ordinary course of the company s business and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
in assessing the value of inventories  the company must make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence  aging of inventories and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products 
in performing such evaluations  the company uses historical experience as well as current market information

additionally  deferred tax liabilities are regularly reviewed to confirm that such amounts are appropriately stated 
all of such evaluations require significant management judgments 
business combinations acquisitions require significant estimates and judgments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
certain liabilities are subjective in nature
