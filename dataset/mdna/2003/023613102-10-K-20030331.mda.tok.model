item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company was incorporated under indiana law for the purpose of becoming the holding company for ameriana bank and trust of indiana 
in  the company acquired all of ameriana bank and trust of indiana common stock in connection with its reorganization into the holding company form of ownership 
in  the company acquired ameriana bank of ohio  fsb abo 
abo was merged into ameriana bank and trust of indiana in october on june   ameriana bank and trust of indiana converted from a federal savings bank to an indiana chartered state savings bank and changed its name to ameriana bank and trust  sb 
at the same time  the company contributed ameriana insurance agency  inc aia to the bank 
aia operates a general insurance agency in three locations 
the bank has a brokerage operation through its wholly owned subsidiary ameriana financial services  inc afs 
afs also owns a partial interest in a life insurance company and a title insurance company 
in  the company purchased a minority interest in a limited partnership organized to acquire and manage real estate investments  which qualify for federal tax credits 
the largest components of the company s total revenue and total expense are interest income and interest expense  respectively 
consequently  the company s earnings are primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is determined by i the difference between rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread  and ii the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
levels of other income and operating expenses also significantly affect net income 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions and are integral to the understanding of reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective  or complex 
allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses provides coverage for probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses each quarter based on changes  if any  in underwriting activities  the loan portfolio composition including product mix and geographic  industry or customer specific concentrations  trends in loan performance  regulatory guidance and economic factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires the use of significant management estimates 
many factors can affect management s estimates of specific and expected losses  including volatility of default probabilities  rating migrations  loss severity and economic and political conditions 
the allowance is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge offs 
the company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the allowance recorded for commercial loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and an analysis of the migration of commercial loans and actual loss experience 
the allowance recorded for homogeneous consumer loans is based on an analysis of loan mix  risk characteristics of the portfolio  fraud loss and bankruptcy experiences  and historical losses  adjusted for current trends  for each homogeneous category or group of loans 
the allowance for credit losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan s observable market price  the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans  or the discounted cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate 
regardless of the extent of the company s analysis of customer performance  portfolio trends or risk management processes  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio 
this is due to several factors including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends 
volatility of economic or customer specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger non homogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogenous groups of loans are among other factors 
the company estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures 
the estimates are based upon the company s evaluation of imprecision risk associated with the commercial and consumer allowance levels and the estimated impact of the current economic environment 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights msrs associated with loans originated and sold  where servicing is retained  are capitalized and included in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the value of the capitalized servicing rights represents the present value of the future servicing fees arising from the right to service loans in the portfolio 
critical accounting policies for msrs relate to the initial valuation and subsequent impairment tests 
the methodology used to determine the valuation of msrs requires the development and use of a number of estimates  including anticipated principal amortization and prepayments of that principal balance 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the carrying value of the msrs is periodically reviewed for impairment based on a determination of fair value 
impairment  if any  is recognized through a valuation allowance and is recorded as amortization of intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangibles 
the company records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas goodwill is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight line and accelerated methods  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired asset will perform in the future 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  customer attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  specific industry conditions and changes in competition 
financial condition total assets decreased million or to million at december   from million at december  cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  from million at december  this was mainly due to a decline in the loan portfolio during mortgage loan refinancing was a major factor for the decline 
due to the rate environment in  the bank sold the majority of its fixed rate originations 
securities investment securities decreased approximately million to million at december   from million at december  the bank s interest rate risk position for year end exceeded the bank s risk parameters  primarily due to volatile collateralized mortgage obligations cmo 
in order to restructure the investment portfolio  securities were reclassified from held to maturity to available for sale effective december  the bank disposed of most of the security portfolio in the first quarter for an after tax loss of approximately million 
the breakdown of the securities sold by type  were agency bonds with a net book value of million  for a pretax loss of  and cmos with a net book value of million  for a pretax loss of million 
the proceeds from the sale were used to pay off federal home loan bank fhlb advances of million in the first quarter and the company reinvested the remainder in the first and second quarters of in an adjustable rate mortgage arm mutual fund comprised of adjustable rate mortgage back securities mbs  agencies and mbs securities and which presented less interest rate risk than the liquidated investments see interest rate risk 
in september  the bank determined it could improve its net interest margin by paying down the majority of fhlb advances with the sale of a similar amount of investment securities 
the company sold an additional million of investments in the third quarter and realized a gain of approximately million on the sale  which offset to some extent  the loss on disposition of investments realized earlier in the year 
the proceeds from this latest investment sale were used to pay off higher rate fhlb advances  which included a prepayment penalty of approximately million 
these transactions  taken together  had a net pre tax income effect of about  aside from the de leveraging effect  these transactions are expected to improve the company s net interest margin through the reduction of higher rate debt with proceeds from the sale of lower earning investments

proceeds from loans sold in the secondary markets were million in  and million in fixed mortgage loan rates have been at historic lows during this two year period which has increased the volume of refinances 
the fixed rate residential loans are sold to minimize the bank s exposure to interest rate risk 
due to the consumer demand for fixed rate loans  the bank s residential loan portfolio has declined 
the bank generally retains loan servicing on loans originated and sold in indiana  and sells loans and loan servicing rights for loans originated and sold in ohio 
loans serviced by the bank for investors  primarily the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and federal national mortgage association fnma  totaled approximately million in and million in loans sold and subsequently serviced by the bank generate a steady source of fee income with servicing fees ranging from to 
in  the bank purchased two separate pools of lease receivables  totaling million  which is the reason for the substantial increase in commercial loans and leases in in these two pools went into default 
please see credit quality for additional information 
consumer loans made up and of the total loan portfolio for year ends and respectively 
consumer loans declined million to million at december  from million at december  the decline was due to reduced loan volume as market competitive rates were below minimums established by the company 
total loan production was strong for and new loan production was million and million in and  respectively 
since the bank sells most of its fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market  the loan volume is not fully reflected in the balance sheet 
credit quality non performing assets  totaling million  grew substantially in this represents an increase of million over the non performing assets total of million 
the main cause for the increase is related to two lease pools totaling million and related loans to a builder developer of million 
the two lease pools are supported by a surety bond issued by one of two insurance companies rated at least a by moody s 
the bonds guarantee payment of all amounts due under the leases in the event of default by the lessee 
when the lease pools went into default  notice was given to each insurer 
one of them made payments for a few months under a reservation of rights  the other paid nothing 
both insurers claim they were defrauded by commercial money center cmc  the company which sold the lease pools 
both are now denying responsibility for payment 
cmc has also filed for bankruptcy protection 
the current unpaid balance for the pools is  it is highly unlikely that the litigation will be resolved during the bank believes the surety bonds are enforceable against the insurers 
the bank also has a number of real estate development lot loans and single family residential loans on existing properties with a builder developer group  and its related parties  that are currently in default and bankruptcy 
the bank is working closely with the workout specialist hired by the bankruptcy trustee on liquidation of the properties involved in the bankruptcy and we are negotiating with the borrower and their counsel for resolution of the remaining properties 
the total outstanding balance of the various loans totaled million as of december  the following table compares delinquent loans as a percentage of total loans december  days non days non and accrual and accrual days over loans totals days over loans total real estate residential commercial construction commercial loans consumer loans leases totals still accruing the increase in day delinquencies is largely the result of a weak economy 
the non accrual loans increased primarily due to the two lease pools in default  and builder developer loans related to one party  as previously discussed 
the bank s charged off loans less recoveries were  and  in and respectively 
the percentage of net charge offs to average assets were and in and respectively 
the bank made structural changes in the lending area in the bank added the new position of senior vice president of credit administration and also added additional loan staff 
deposits interest rates paid on bank deposits were near historic lows in as market interest rates continued to fall 
the federal funds interest rate  the rate banks charge other banks on overnight loans was at a year low 
fed fund rates generally affect the prime lending rate  which was at a year historic low 
the federal reserve has cut the fed funds rate a dozen times since  with the last rate cut of in november short term deposits deposits with maturities of one year or less  including certificate accounts  checking  savings and money market accounts  comprised of the bank s deposit portfolio as of year end  compared to for the same period in with such a high percentage of deposit accounts staying short term  an increase in rates in the near future may squeeze the bank s net interest margin in the short term  since loans are slower to re price at new market rates 
deposits declined million or in for a year end portfolio balance of million 
the deposit portfolio at year end was million 
the main reason for the decline is public fund certificates public funds include deposits from state and local municipal agencies  which had a balance of million at december  the bank held no public fund certificates at december  public fund certificate balances may be more volatile than bank customer deposits 
the following table shows deposit changes by category dollars in thousands change change december  savings deposits    now accounts    money market accounts    certificates  and more    other certificates    totals    borrowings borrowings declined sharply in fhlb advances declined million to million at year end from million at year end the decline was due to de leveraging strategies implemented by the bank in september the borrowings were paid down from security sales see securities for more information 
notes payable by the company declined  to  at year end  from  at year end included in this amount was a note payable to a third party financial institution with a current balance of  and bearing interest at at december   the proceeds of which were used to finance stock repurchases during the remainder of notes payable with a balance of  and  at december  and  respectively  are notes payable to former stockholders of cardinal state bank 
interest rate risk the bank is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits and borrowings from the fhlb  mature or reprice at different rates than its interest earning assets 
although having liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may not be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  such an asset liability structure could result in higher net income during periods of declining interest rates  unless offset by other factors 
the asset liability committee and the board of directors review the bank s exposure to interest rate changes and market risk on a quarterly basis 
this review is accomplished by the use of a cash flow simulation model using detailed securities  loan  deposit  borrowings and market information to estimate fair values of assets and liabilities using discounted cash flows 
the difference between the bank s estimated fair value of assets and the estimated fair value of liabilities  is the fair value of equity  also referred to as net present value of equity npv 
the change in the npv is calculated at different interest rate intervals 
this tests the interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates to determine the change in the bank s npv 
the model also tests the impact various interest rate scenarios have on net interest income and net income over a stated period of time one year for example 
the model uses a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments or extension in maturity and repayment in loans  mbs cmo and certain types of callable investments 
these computations did not contemplate actions management may undertake to reposition the assets and liabilities  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the model of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below present levels  the portion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to loan refinancing or payoff activity 
in the event of an interest rate change  pre payment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the model and the ability of borrowers to repay their adjustable rate loans may decrease during rising interest rate environments

management determined that a significant deterioration had occurred in company s cmo portfolio which resulted in a large increase in the company s exposure to future increases in interest rate risk 
upon further review  management determined that the increase in the exposure was significant enough to call into question the prudence of continuing to hold the securities to maturity 
in order to take the necessary action to reduce this exposure  management decided to move the entire securities portfolio from the held to maturity accounting classification to the available for sale classification as of december  in  the company determined that most of its investments no longer fit its risk profile given the unsettled  uncertain and volatile nature of the market and the possibility that interest rates could move against the portfolio 
the decelerating speed of prepayments on these instruments during the first quarter of was remarkable  significantly extending the practical maturity of the portfolio to a level that exceeded the bank s risk parameters 
the alternatives to taking immediate action to mitigate the potential losses  including long term funding strategies  hedging strategies and partial liquidations  were felt to be inadequate in the circumstances 
the company decided to liquidate the majority of the investment portfolio during the first quarter of the proceeds from the liquidation of the company s investments were first applied towards repayment of short term borrowings from the fhlb 
this increased the company s flexibility to retain more of its self originated loans in portfolio and to purchase loan participations in the region  as they became available 
the balance of the proceeds were used to purchase short term liquid investments  including limited maturity mbs  which present less interest rate risk than the liquidated investments  and an arm mutual fund 
the company also used some proceeds to invest in intermediate term mbs to provide a balance to its portfolio between interest rate risk reduction and maintenance of higher net interest income levels

see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for the pro forma effect on net income and option activity 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
this requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or at the same rate as changes in the prices of goods and services  which are directly affected by inflation  although interest rates may fluctuate in response to perceived changes in the rate of inflation

amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 companies that adopted the fair value based method were required to apply that method prospectively for new stock option awards 
this contributed to a ramp up effect on stock based compensation expense in the first few years following adoption  which caused concern for companies and investors because of the lack of consistency in reported results 
to address that concern  sfas no 
provides two additional methods of transition that reflect an entity s full complement of stock based compensation expense immediately upon adoption  thereby eliminating the ramp up effect 
sfas no 
also improves the clarity and prominence of disclosures about the pro forma effects of using the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation for all companies regardless of the accounting method used by requiring that the data be presented more prominently and in a more user friendly format in the footnotes to the financial statements 
in addition  sfas no 
improves the timeliness of those disclosures by requiring that this information be included in interim as well as annual financial statements 
in the past  companies were required to make pro forma disclosures only in annual financial statements 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december   with earlier application permitted in certain circumstances 
the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations
