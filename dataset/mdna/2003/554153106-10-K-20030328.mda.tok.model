item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dollars in thousands the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto presented elsewhere in this report 
overview mac gray derives its revenue principally as a laundry facilities contractor for the multi housing industry 
mac gray also sells and services commercial laundry equipment and microfridge equipment 
mac gray also operates card coin operated reprographics equipment in academic and public libraries 
mac gray operates laundry rooms  reprographics equipment and microfridge equipment under long term leases with property owners  colleges and universities  and governmental agencies 
mac gray s laundry services segment is comprised of revenue generating laundry machines  operated in approximately  multi housing laundry rooms located in states and the district of columbia 
mac gray s reprographics segment is concentrated in the northeastern united states  with smaller operations in the mid atlantic  florida and the midwest 
mac gray also derives revenue as a distributor and servicer of commercial laundry equipment manufactured by the maytag corporation  and sells laundry equipment manufactured by american dryer corp  the dexter company  and whirlpool corporation 
additionally  the company sells or rents laundry equipment to restaurants  hotels  health clubs and similar institutional users that operate their own on premise laundry facilities 
the microfridge services segment derives revenue through the sale and rental of its microfridge units to colleges and universities  military bases  the hotel and motel market  and assisted living facilities 
results of operations dollars in thousands fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenue in each of our route  rental and sales businesses for the years ended december   and were as follows revenue laundry route    laundry equipment sales    laundry rental    reprographics route    total laundry and reprographics    microfridge equipment sales    microfridge rental    total microfridge    total revenue    revenue decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this decrease is primarily related to a decrease in microfridge sales and rental revenue and  to a lesser extent  to decreases in laundry route revenue and reprographics route revenue  partially offset by an increase in laundry equipment sales 
the decrease in microfridge revenue  as compared to  is attributable primarily to a decrease of in the academic sales and rental business and a decrease in the hotel and assisted living business 
these microfridge decreases were offset  in part  by a increase in sales of microfridge products to the government market 
the decrease in academic business  as compared to  was caused primarily by less rental business on campus  both rented to colleges and universities and rented directly to students 
we believe these lower numbers were due to hesitation on the part of the schools to commit to such a program in such uncertain economic times  and to students purchasing similar units at retail stores 
we continue to avoid entering into rental contracts  which fail to reach an acceptable profit margin for the company  and we continue our strategy of attempting to convert our school rental customers to a purchase program 
in any given period  the company may be unable to offset losses resulting from this intended ongoing decline in microfridge rental revenue 
we believe sales to the academic  hotel and assisted living markets have decreased  as compared to  primarily due to the overall slower us economy 
many schools have deferred spending due to endowment contributions to operating budgets being lower than in past years 
further  hotels and assisted living facilities have reduced spending due  in part  to the inability to finance expansion and remodeling of units as well as the overall decline in hotel occupancy due to the general us economic slowdown 
total laundry route revenue decreased by  or less than  due primarily to an increase in apartment vacancy rates in several of the company s laundry route markets 
the apartment vacancy rates have increased in those southern states where the company conducts business  particularly florida  georgia  and north carolina where the company believes this increase in vacancy rates has led to a decline in revenue 
vacancy rates have not increased to the same extent in the company s northern markets and the company experienced revenue gains in those markets in the decreases were partially offset by machines added to the total number in service  increases in vend rates  and continued conversion from coin operated equipment to higher revenue generating card operated equipment 
increases in machine vend rates are typically taken at locations which have not had an increase in vend price for over a year 
an increase in vend price at a coin operated location will typically be in increments of per use  whereas at a card operated location the increase may vary due to technology allowing for increases at more flexible increments 
reprographics route revenue in decreased by  or  as compared to this decrease was attributable to the decrease in machine use in libraries and similar facilities  as compared to  and a reduction in the number of locations operated by the company 
in the second half of  the company chose to not renew several contracts when it could not negotiate acceptable terms 
the company also chose to terminate several small at will accounts which were no longer profitable due to declining revenue 
in total  the company eliminated approximately accounts  representing approximately of its revenue 
laundry equipment sales increased in as compared to by  or 
this increase was attributable primarily to success at further penetrating the government market  offset somewhat by a decrease of sales to laundromats and other traditional customers 
laundry rental revenue in has increased as compared to  or 
laundry rental revenue is derived from leasing commercial laundry equipment to customers who prefer to maintain their own laundry rooms 
route rent 
route rent  the amount paid to property owners or managers and school and public libraries  decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in laundry route revenue of and reprographics revenue of  and an improvement in the ratio of laundry route rent to laundry route revenue 
the improvement of laundry route rent as a percentage of laundry route revenue in is primarily attributable to new and renegotiated laundry route contracts having improved route rent formulas 
in addition to laundry route rent being affected by new and renegotiated contracts  laundry route rent can be affected by other factors such as the amount of prepaid rent payments and laundry room betterments invested in new or renegotiated contracts 
as the company varies the amount invested in a property  the route rent as a derivative of route revenue can vary 
prepaid rent payments and betterments are amortized over the life of the contract 
the percentage of route rent to revenue is also impacted by the rent rate structure in the reprographics segment 
because this segment has a much lower rent rate structure than the laundry segment  any decrease in revenue will result in an increase in the overall route rent percentage of revenue 
reprographics route revenue decreased in as compared to by route expenditures and other direct costs 
route expenditures and other direct costs include costs associated with installing and servicing laundry and reprographics route machines  as well as the costs of collecting  counting and depositing the revenue 
route expenditures also include the costs of delivering and servicing sold and rented laundry and microfridge equipment 
route expenditures increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  route expenditures were and  respectively  of total revenues for the years ended december  and december  despite a decrease in total revenue of  in as compared to  route expenditures and other direct costs remained nearly flat due to the fixed nature of many route operating expenses  and increases in variable expenses partially offset by cost cutting programs 
route expenditures are also affected by the mix of revenue 
in  laundry and microfridge equipment sales increased slightly as a percentage of total revenue 
these sales create higher operating costs due to delivery and installation generally being more costly in the sales business than in the route business 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization include amounts included as a component of cost of revenue  which are primarily related to laundry and microfridge equipment in the field  and amounts included as an operating expense  which are primarily non revenue generating corporate assets 
aggregate depreciation and amortization decreased by  or  from year ended december   to  for the year ended december  depreciation expense of property  plant and equipment remained flat when compared to due to the fact that the amount spent by the company on capital expenditures has not changed significantly in the last several years 
amortization expense has decreased by  in as compared to  primarily due to the effect of the adoption of fas on january  had goodwill been amortized in   would have been charged to income 
in   of goodwill amortization was charged to income 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales increased by  or  from the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  gross margins on product sales were for both the years ended december  and december  the gross margin on product sales includes laundry and microfridge equipment sales 
the gross margin in the laundry equipment sales business improved from in to in this increase was primarily attributable to changes in product sales mix  price increases on selected products and a shift from selling some products through other commercial distributors to selling directly to the end users at higher margins 
the gross margin associated with microfridge equipment sales remained the same at for the years ended december  and this sales margin was the net of several factors  including changes in sales mix between the academic  hotel and government divisions  competitive pressure in the microfridge markets  particularly the hotel market where the company made price concessions to secure sales  and increased sales of larger refrigerator units  which have lower gross margins than smaller units 
also affecting the gross margin of equipment sales was the improvement in  as compared to  of the gross margin earned from laundry equipment sales to the government 
general  administration  sales and marketing expense 
general  administration  sales and marketing expenses increased by from the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  general  administration  sales and marketing expenses were and of revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
this increase was primarily attributable to increases in advertising  insurance  reserve for doubtful accounts and professional fees 
the increase in advertising was primarily in the microfridge business  followed by the laundry equipment sales business 
in both of these businesses  increased advertising expenditures were in reaction to the effect of the general economic downturn 
insurance costs for  as compared to  have also increased by approximately  due to conditions existing in the insurance industry 
interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased by  or  from the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily related to a decrease in total borrowings 
the total borrowings of the company decreased by  during the year from  at december   to  at december  interest expense was not significantly affected by fluctuations in interest rates due to interest rate swap agreements  which were in place for the entire year 
interest expense for the year ended december  includes a non cash expense of  before the effect of income taxes  related to the terminated swap agreement and the ineffective portion of the february swap agreement 
provision for income tax 
the effective tax rate decreased from to from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the provision for income tax is higher than the company s statutory tax rate primarily due to goodwill amortization deducted in for financial reporting purposes  which are not deductible for federal and state tax purposes 
in  the company ceased the amortization of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of fas this eliminated the goodwill amortization that was not deductible for federal and state tax purposes and resulted in a lower effective tax rate than in effect of change in accounting principle 
on january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
as a result of an evaluation conducted by an independent third party valuation firm  it was determined that the fair value of the laundry and microfridge reporting units exceeded their book value  therefore no impairment of goodwill occurred in these reporting units 
however  due to the continued decline in the services of the reprographics reporting unit as a result of expanding use of the internet and access to free laser printers in college and public libraries  the book value of the reprographics reporting unit exceeded the fair value  resulting in a non cash write off of the remaining book value of the reporting unit s goodwill in the period ended march   of  or per share 
following is the impact on earnings of implementing fas on the year ended december   and what the impact on the same period in and would have been see note  consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  per share per share per share reported earnings    add impairment charge to comply with new accounting standard net of taxes add goodwill amortization net of taxes   fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenue decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this decrease is primarily related to a decrease in microfridge sales and rental  and to a lesser extent  to decreases in reprographics route revenue and laundry equipment sales 
the decrease in microfridge sales as compared to is attributable primarily to the academic market  as several academic customers postponed or canceled decisions to purchase microfridge units for dormitories 
however  an increase in sales to the hotel market of somewhat offset the decrease in sales to the academic market 
microfridge sales in its two other markets  government and assisted living  were slightly lower than sales in those markets for the prior year 
despite a sales shortfall in fourth quarter  as compared to fourth quarter  sales to the hotel market increased in as compared to  primarily due to a widening of the company s geographical market penetration and an increase in the range of microfridge products offered 
laundry equipment sales and microfridge assisted living sales decreased in as a result of the general us economic environment in the second half of the year 
total laundry route revenue increased by  or  which was offset by a  or  decrease in reprographics route revenue 
the increase in laundry route revenue is attributable to the increase in card coin operated machines placed in service during increases in vending rates also contributed to the overall revenue increase 
reprographics route revenue in was affected by the decrease in machine use in libraries and similar facilities  as compared to as access to the internet and the use of non vended laser printers continues to increase  the number of vended copies made has decreased 
the company has made progress in converting existing customers from variable based fee structures to flat rate fee structures  and has gained new customers using a flat rate structure 
however  the company has thus far been unable to offset the loss of revenue and margin caused by the accessibility of the internet in libraries  and the resulting switch to non vended printing 
without the restructuring of fees and services  the company may continue to experience a decrease in demand for its vended reprographics equipment at existing customers 
other revenue  which consists primarily of laundry and microfridge rental revenue  decreased  or  over revenue for the year this decrease consisted of a  decrease in microfridge rental and a increase in laundry rental revenue 
the microfridge decrease resulted primarily from the company s continued strategy of withdrawing from the less profitable academic and direct to student rental programs  and the corresponding effort to convert these programs to sales 
in any given period  the company may be unable to offset losses resulting from this intended ongoing decline in microfridge rental revenue 
route rent 
route rent  the amount paid to property owners or managers  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this overall increase was primarily attributable to an increase in laundry route revenue  since route rent is generally a derivative of revenue earned in the company s route locations 
as a percentage of route revenue  route rent increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  fluctuations are caused by varying rates of route rents on new and renegotiated contracts 
laundry route rent can also be affected by other factors such as the amount of prepaid rent payments  and laundry room betterments invested in new or renegotiated contracts 
as the company varies the amount invested in a property  the route rent as a percentage of route revenue can vary 
prepaid rent payments and betterments are amortized over the life of the contract 
the percentage of route rent to revenue is also impacted by the rent rate structure in the reprographics segment 
reprographics route revenue decreased in as compared to because this segment has a much lower rent rate structure than the laundry segment  any decrease in revenue as a percentage of the total reprographics revenue will result in an increase in the overall route rent percentage of revenue 
route expenditures 
route expenditures include costs associated with installing and servicing laundry and reprographics route machines  as well as the costs of collecting  counting and depositing the revenue 
route expenditures also include the costs of delivering and servicing sold and rented laundry and microfridge equipment 
route expenditures increased by to  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  route expenditures were of revenues for both the years ended december  and december  route expenditures did not change in as compared to  due to the variability of some expenses  such as certain employee costs  which decrease as revenues decrease  and other operating expenses which have been reduced through cost cutting programs  specifically in the area of vehicle expense and parts efficiencies 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization include amounts included as a component of cost of revenue  which are primarily related to laundry and microfridge equipment in the field  and amounts included as an operating expense  which are primarily non revenue generating corporate assets 
aggregate depreciation and amortization increased by  or  from year ended december   to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the company s machine base due to internal growth 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales decreased by  or  from the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  gross margins on product sales were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in gross margin is attributable primarily to competitive pressure in the microfridge markets  particularly the hotel market  where the company made price concessions to secure sales 
also affecting the reduction in gross margin in the microfridge segment was the introduction of larger size refrigeration units  which have a lower gross margin than smaller units  and have comprised a larger portion of total revenue than in prior years 
the gross margin decrease was further affected by the increase in sales of laundry equipment to government entities 
the mix of product sales to government entities and certain volume discounts associated with these sales caused reductions in the gross margin 
general  administration  sales and marketing expense 
general  administration  sales and marketing expenses decreased by from the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  general  administration  sales and marketing expenses were of revenue for both the years ended december  and this overall decrease was primarily attributable to certain costs incurred in which did not recur in  such as legal and consulting fees  and a reduction in required bad debt reserves as a result of improved credit approval and collection procedures 
in  the company increased certain marketing expenditures over  where such spending was expected to generate increased revenue 
interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased by  or  from the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily related to both the impact of lower interest rates and a decrease in total borrowings 
the total borrowings of the company decreased during the year to  at december   from  at december  provision for income tax 
the effective tax rate increased from to from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this increase in the effective tax rate is due to certain expenses not deductible for taxes  primarily amortization of intangible assets associated with acquired businesses making up a greater portion of total taxable income 
the provision for income tax is higher than the company s statutory tax rate primarily due to goodwill amortization deducted for financial reporting purposes  which is not deductible for federal and state tax purposes 
seasonality the company experiences moderate seasonality as a result of its significant operations in the college and university market 
revenues derived from the college and university market represented approximately of the company s total revenue for academic route and rental revenues are derived substantially during the school year in the first  second and fourth calendar quarters 
conversely  the company s operating and capital expenditures increase during the third calendar quarter  when it installs a large number of machines while colleges and universities are generally on summer break 
product sales  principally of microfridge products  to this market are also high during the third calendar quarter 
in total capital expenditures were  of which  was invested in laundry route equipment 
of this amount  approximately was invested in the third quarter 
liquidity and capital resources dollars in thousands mac gray s primary source of cash has been derived from operating activities 
the company s primary uses of cash have been the purchase of new laundry machines  microfridge equipment  reprographics equipment and the reduction of bank debt 
the company anticipates that it will continue to use cash generated from its operating activities to finance working capital needs  including interest payments on any outstanding indebtedness  as well as capital expenditures and other purposes 
cash flows provided by operations were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flow from operations consists primarily of activities affecting the company s core operating activities  such as route revenue  product sales  equipment service revenue and rental revenue  offset by route rent  route expenditures  cost of product sales  cost of rental revenue  general and administration expenses and sales and marketing expenses 
the increase from to of  is primarily attributable to the net of the positive impact of increases in deferred income taxes  accounts payable  accrued route rent and accrued expenses  and a decrease in prepaid expenses  route rent and other assets with the negative impact of a decrease in depreciation and amortization and an increase in inventory 
deferred income tax liabilities in increased by  due to the use of accelerated depreciation on assets acquired creating a difference between book and tax depreciation 
accounts payable  accrued route rent and accrued expenses increased in by  primarily as a result of timing of inventory purchases and payments 
prepaid expenses  route rent and other assets decreased by  in primarily due to collection of receivables under long term microfridge equipment leases and a decrease in prepaid expenses and rent paid to new laundry route customers 
depreciation and amortization decreased in by  as compared to of this decrease   is attributable to the effect of cessation of goodwill amortization in accordance with the provisions of fas inventory increased by  in due to a  increase in microfridge equipment inventory offset by a decrease in laundry equipment inventory of the increase in microfridge inventory occurred primarily as a result of inventory build up in anticipation of a better than actual academic sales season 
this inventory will be used in the ordinary course of business 
cash used in investing activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the most significant component of cash flows used in investing activities is capital expenditures  which increased by for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  capital expenditures were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures as compared to was attributable to an increase in the amount of new laundry equipment placed in service in partially offset by decreases in capital expenditures for microfridge  reprographics and administration 
cash flows used in financing activities were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
financing activities for those periods consist primarily of proceeds from and repayments of bank borrowings  and capital stock transactions 
the decreases in and are principally the results of a concentrated effort by the company to pay down debt

the credit facility provides for borrowings of up to  consisting of borrowings under a three year revolving line of credit of up to  and a five year  senior secured term loan facility term loan 
on june   the company negotiated an extension of the revolving line of credit portion of the credit facility to july  on december   the company entered into an amendment that allowed the repurchase of capital stock of the company and modified the calculation of the maximum amount of capital expenditures and the operating cash flow ratio 
there were no other changes to the credit facility 
the term loan matures in quarterly increments through june the company is also required to pay an amount equal to of the excess cash flow  as defined  for each fiscal year in the event that the funded debt ratio for each of the preceding four fiscal quarters was greater than to the funded debt ratio is defined as total funded debt divided by earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
this payment is first used to reduce the term loan with any remaining amounts used to reduce the revolving line of credit 
the company made excess cash flow payments of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
no excess cash flow payment was required for the year ended december  as of december   there was  outstanding under the term loan and  outstanding under the revolving line of credit  and the unused balance under the revolving line of credit was  at december  outstanding letters of credit amounted to the credit facility is collateralized by a blanket lien on the assets of the company and each of its subsidiaries  as well as a pledge by the company of all of the capital stock of its subsidiaries

this covenant is tested at the end of each calendar quarter 
at december   the company s ebitda was million for the prior four quarters 
the company s ebitda decreased in as compared to and in as compared to if this trend continues at a significant rate  the company could fail to meet the minimum ebitda covenant in the future and  absent a waiver from its lenders  such failure would permit the lenders to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
at december   the company failed to meet the required minimum ebitda covenant  and a waiver of this failure was received from the company s lenders 
outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest  at the company s option  at a rate equal to the prime rate or libor plus 
the average interest rate at december  was approximately to help mitigate the effect of possible higher interest rates  on february   the company entered into two interest rate swaps  and fixed  of loan interest rate for years and  of loan interest rate for years 
on january   the company terminated the three year  swap and entered into a  swap expiring in february  bearing a lower interest rate

cash and cash equivalents 
the company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
on occasion the company has excess cash available for a short period of time  when this occurs  the company invests such excess cash in repurchase agreements and other highly liquid short term investments 
accordingly  the investments are subject to minimal credit and market risk 
included in cash and cash equivalents is an estimate of cash not yet collected at period end  which remains at laundry and reprographics customer locations 
at december  and  this totaled  and  respectively 
the company records the estimated cash not yet collected as cash and cash equivalents and route revenue 
the company also records the estimated related route rent expense and accrued route rent 
these estimates are based upon historical collection trends  so that total cash at the end of each period will be reasonably stated 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes laundry and reprographics route revenue on the accrual basis 
microfridge rental revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual period  which is generally less than one year 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment of the products  unless otherwise specified 
the company offers limited duration warranties on microfridge products and  at the time of sale  provides reserves for all estimated warranty costs based upon historical warranty costs 
actual costs have not exceeded the company s estimates 
shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized upon shipment of the products and are included in revenue with related cost included in cost of sales 
the company has entered into long term lease transactions that meet the qualifications of a sales type lease for certain equipment 
for these transactions  the amount of revenue recognized upon product shipment is the present value of the minimum lease payments  net of executory costs  together with the profit thereon  discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease 
interest revenue is recognized over the life of the rental agreement 
at december  and the company had  and  respectively  in receivables related to sales type leases 
these receivables have been recorded net of unearned interest income of  and at december  and these receivables are primarily due ratably over the next seven years and have been classified as other current assets and other long term assets  as appropriate  on the balance sheet 
the related reserve for uncollectable lease receivables at december  and was and  respectively 
the company has not entered into significant sales type leases since the company believes its accounting for route revenue  rental revenue and long term lease transactions is appropriate for the company  best matching the nature of the transaction with the proper reporting period 
provision for doubtful accounts 
on a regular basis  the company reviews the adequacy of its provision for doubtful accounts for trade accounts receivable and lease receivables based on historical collection results and current economic conditions using factors based on the aging of its trade accounts and lease receivable 
in addition  the company estimates specific additional allowances based on indications that a specific customer may be experiencing financial difficulties 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost as determined using the first in  first out method or market and primarily consist of finished goods 
based on the nature of the company s inventory  being laundry and microfridge equipment  and the inventory handling practices of the company  the company believes the lower of cost or market is the most appropriate valuation method for the company 
provision for inventory reserves 
on a regular basis  the company reviews the adequacy of its reserve for inventory obsolescence based on historical experience  product knowledge and frequency of shipments 
intangible assets 
intangible assets primarily consist of various non compete agreements  customer lists  goodwill and contract rights recorded in connection with the acquisitions 
the non compete agreements are amortized using the straight line method over the life of the agreements  which range from two to five years 
customer lists are amortized using the straight line method over five to fifteen years 
contract rights are amortized using the straight line method over fifteen years 
based on its experience  the company believes that these costs  associated with various acquisitions  are properly recognized and amortized over a reasonable length of time 
in accordance with fas  the company stopped amortizing goodwill on january  impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets with definitive lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
in accordance with fas  the company tests its goodwill annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
the goodwill impairment review consists of a two step process of first determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit 
fair values of the reporting units were determined based on estimates of comparable market price or discounted future cash flows 
if this fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further analysis or goodwill impairment charge is required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the underlying assets and liabilities  including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets  based on their fair value 
if necessary  goodwill is then written down to its fair value 
on january   in connection with the initial application of fas  the company recognized an impairment charge of financial instruments 
the company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  and statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb no 
fas 
these statements require the company to recognize derivatives on its balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
if the derivative is a hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings  depending on the intended use of the derivative 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company has designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  the change in fair value of the agreements is recognized in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion of the change is recognized in earnings immediately

risk factors this annual report on form k contains statements which are not historical facts and are considered forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements contain projections of the company s future results of operations or financial position or state other forward looking information 
in some cases you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will and would or similar words 
you should not rely on forward looking statements  because they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond the company s control 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors may cause the company s actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that might cause these differences are as follows the company s cash flows may not be sufficient to finance the significant capital expenditures required to replace equipment and implement new technology 
the company must continue to make capital expenditures in order to replace existing equipment 
while it is anticipated that existing capital resources  as well as cash from operations  will be adequate to finance anticipated capital expenditures  the company cannot guarantee the investor that the company s resources or cash flows will be sufficient 
to the extent that available resources are insufficient to fund capital requirements  the company may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or curtail certain capital expenditures 
such financings may not be available or available only on less favorable terms and  in the case of equity financings  could result in dilution to its stockholders 
indebtedness may limit the company s use of cash flow and restrict its flexibility 
in the event the company is unable to decrease the outstanding indebtedness under its credit facility  the increased indebtedness could require use of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to make payments on indebtedness  leaving less cash flow available for other purposes  materially limit or impair the company s ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments  general corporate or other purposes  and reduce flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions 
failure to comply with credit facility covenants may result in an acceleration of substantial indebtedness the credit facility requires the company to comply with various financial and other operating covenants on a quarterly basis 
failure to comply with any of these covenants  without obtaining a waiver from the lender  would permit the lender to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
an acceleration of the credit facility would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
these financial covenants consist of various leverage ratios and other targets 
at december   the company failed to meet the required minimum ebitda covenant  for which a waiver was received from the company s lenders 
concurrent with the waiver of this covenant default  the credit facility was amended to reduce the ebitda covenant target for the remainder of the life of the credit facility 
however  the company s ebitda decreased in as compared to and in as compared to if this trend continues at a significant rate  the company could again fail to meet the minimum ebitda or other covenants at the end of one or more quarters and be required to seek a waiver from its lenders 
if the company were unable to renew its laundry leases the company s results of operations and business could be adversely affected 
the business is highly dependent upon the renewal of leases with property owners  colleges and universities and public housing authorities 
these leases have an average length of seven to ten years with approximately to coming up for renewal each year 
mac gray has traditionally relied upon exclusive  long term leases with its customers  as well as frequent customer interaction and a historical emphasis on customer service  to assure continuity of financial and operating results 
the company cannot guarantee investors that it will be able to continue to secure long term exclusive leases with customers on favorable terms  it will be able to successfully renew existing leases as they expire  or it will not experience a loss of business if apartment vacancy rates increase of if property owners or management companies choose to vacate properties as a result of economic downturns that affect occupancy levels 
failure by the company to continue to obtain long term exclusive leases with a substantial number of its customers  or to successfully renew existing leases as they expire  could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and business 
competition on local and national levels may hinder the company s ability to expand 
the card coin operated laundry services industry is highly competitive  both locally and nationally 
on the local level  private businesses tend to have long standing relationships with property owners and managers in their specific geographic market 
on the national level  there are two competitors with significantly larger installed machine bases than mac gray 
these larger companies tend to have significant operational and managerial resources to devote to expansion and to capture additional market share 
these competitive forces may increase purchase prices for future acquisitions to levels that make the acquisitions less attractive or uneconomical 
accordingly  the company cannot assure that it will be able to compete effectively in any specific geographic location in the business of supplying laundry equipment services to property owners and managers or in the acquisition of other businesses 
if the company is unable to continue its relationships with maytag and other suppliers  the company s profit margins could be reduced and its ability to meet customer requirements could be adversely impacted 
currently the company purchases a majority of the equipment that it uses in the laundry route business from maytag corporation 
in addition  the company derives a significant amount of its non laundry route revenue  as well as competitive advantages  from its position as a distributor of maytag commercial laundry products 
although either party  upon written notice  may terminate the agreements between the company and maytag corporation  maytag corporation has never terminated any agreement with the company 
the company s relationship with maytag dates from in addition  the company currently procures the products used by the microfridge segment from a limited number of suppliers 
if maytag or any of these other suppliers terminated or demanded a substantial revision of the contracts or business relationships currently in place  there may be a delay in finding a replacement  and an inability to find terms as favorable as the current terms  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations or its ability to meet customer demands 
the microfridge segment has a non competition agreement with sanyo whereby sanyo is precluded from entering the microfridge market  provided that certain minimum annual quantities of products are purchased from sanyo 
the company s ability to make acquisitions depends upon its ability to access capital on acceptable terms 
partial success of the company s long term growth strategy is dependent upon its ability to identify  finance and consummate acquisitions on acceptable financial terms 
access to capital is subject to the following risks use of common stock as acquisition consideration may result in dilution to stockholders  if the common stock does not maintain a sufficient valuation or if potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept shares of the company s common stock  then the company will be required to use more cash resources or other consideration to make acquisitions  if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash for acquisitions from existing operations  its ability to make acquisitions could be adversely affected unless it is able to obtain additional capital through external financings or to borrow sufficient amounts  and funding the acquisition program through debt financing will result in additional leverage 
growth strategy may not be successful if the company is unable to acquire and integrate new businesses 
the company s long term growth strategy depends  in part  on its ability to acquire and successfully integrate and operate additional businesses 
while the company generally believes that the management team and business structure currently in place enables it to operate a significantly larger and more diverse operation  it may be exposed to the following risks in connection with finding  completing  and successfully integrating acquisitions the inability to effectively and efficiently integrate the assets of the acquired business  the inability to increase the revenue and profit of the acquired business  the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of money and time integrating acquired businesses  particularly operations located in new regions and operations involving new lines of business 
multi housing vacancy rates could effect revenue from the operations of laundry route contracts 
consistency of revenue from the operations of vended laundry equipment  particularly in the multi housing industry  depends partially upon the level of tenant occupancy 
the number of apartments occupied in an apartment building with a vended laundry room can directly affect the company s revenue 
the level of occupancy can be adversely affected by many market economic conditions  including local economic slowdowns  and corresponding increases in unemployment rate oversupply of apartments lower mortgage interest rates which encourage apartment dwellers to purchase homes the microfridge products may be susceptible to product liability claims for which insurance may not be adequate 
through the microfridge segment  the company markets and distributes microfridge  a combination microwave and refrigerator 
the sale and distribution of microfridge  as well as other products  entails a risk of product liability claims 
further  although microfridge is manufactured by third parties under contract with microfridge  microfridge may be subject to risks of product liability claims related to this manufacture 
potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded from coverage 
the company cannot assure investors that it will be able to renew existing insurance at a cost and level of coverage comparable to that currently in effect  if at all 
in the event that the microfridge segment is held liable for a claim against which it is not indemnified or for damages exceeding the limits of insurance coverage  the claim could have a material adverse effect on business 
reliance upon common law and contractual intellectual property rights may be insufficient to protect the company from adverse claims 
the company relies upon certain trademark  service mark  copyright  patent and trade secret laws  employee and third party non disclosure and non solicitation agreements and other methods to protect proprietary rights 
periodically the company makes filings with the patent and trademark office to protect some of its proprietary rights  although the company has traditionally relied upon the protections afforded by contract rights and through common law ownership rights 
the company cannot assure investors that these contract rights and legal claims to ownership will adequately protect the operations from adverse claims 
in addition  any adverse claims or litigation  with or without merit  could be costly and could divert management s attention from the operation of the business 
certain stockholders  directors and executive officers could exercise control and prevent a sale or merger 
as of march   mac gray s directors  executive officers  and certain of its stockholders and their affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
this percentage ownership does not include options to purchase  shares of the common stock held by some of these persons  all of which are currently exercisable 
if these affiliates exercised any of their options  then the ownership of common stock would be further concentrated 
as a result of this concentration in ownership  these stockholders  acting together  have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of the election of directors and all other matters requiring approval by a majority of stockholders 
matters requiring stockholder approval include significant corporate transactions  such as mergers and sales of all or substantially all of the company s assets 
the concentration of ownership in affiliates  together  in some cases  with specific provisions of the company s charter and bylaws  as described below  and applicable sections of the corporate law of delaware  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of mac gray 
provisions of the company s charter  bylaws  delaware law  and the shareholder rights agreement could have the effect of discouraging takeovers 
specific provisions of the company s charter and bylaws  as described below  sections of the corporate law of delaware  the shareholder rights agreement  and powers of the board of directors may discourage takeover attempts not first approved by the board of directors  including takeovers which some stockholders may deem to be in their best interests 
these provisions and powers of the board of directors could delay or prevent the removal of incumbent directors or the assumption of control by stockholders  even if the particular removal or assumption of control would be beneficial to stockholders 
these provisions and powers of the board of directors could also discourage or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  even if these events would be beneficial  in the short term  to the interests of stockholders 
the anti takeover provisions and powers of the board of directors include  among other things the ability of the board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to establish the voting rights  preferences and other terms of such preferred stock  a classified board of directors serving staggered three year terms  the elimination of stockholder voting by written consent  the absence of cumulative voting for directors  the removal of directors only for cause  the vesting of exclusive authority in the board of directors to determine the size of the board of directors and  subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock  if issued  to fill vacancies thereon  the vesting of exclusive authority in the board of directors  except as otherwise required by law  to call special meetings of stockholders  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the board of directors  ownership restrictions  under the corporate law of delaware  with limited exceptions  upon acquirers including their affiliates and associates of or more of its common stock  and the company s entry into a shareholder rights agreement providing for the issuance of rights that will cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires or more of the common shares unless the rights are redeemed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates on its borrowings 
in the normal course of its business  the company manages its exposure to these risks as described below 
the company does not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rates the table below provides information about the company s debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the fair market value of long term debt approximates book value at december  expected maturity date in thousands december  thereafter total long term debt fixed rate  average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate in february  the company entered into two standard international swaps and derivatives association isda interest rate swap agreements with its primary financial institution to manage the interest rate risk associated with its credit facility 
each agreement has a notional amount of  and maturity dates in february and the effect of the swap agreements was to limit the interest rate exposure to a fixed rate of and versus the day libor rate for the three year and five year swaps  respectively 
on january   the company terminated the  swap that expired in and entered into a  swap expiring in february  with a fixed interest rate of until february  and thereafter 
the company believes the risk associated with extending this fixed rate is more than offset by the interest expense savings the company will realize 
in accordance with the swap agreements and on a quarterly basis  interest expense is calculated based on the floating day libor and the fixed rate 
if interest expense as calculated is greater based on the day libor  the financial institution pays the difference to the company  if interest expense as calculated is greater based on the fixed rate  the company pays the difference to the financial institution 
depending on fluctuations in the libor  the company s interest rate exposure and its related impact on interest expense and net cash flow may increase or decrease 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the swap agreement  however  nonperformance is not anticipated 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the reporting date  taking into account current interest rates and the credit worthiness of the counter party 
at december   the company estimates that it would have cost  net of tax  to terminate these agreements 
on june   the company entered into a new senior secured credit facility as referenced  the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for borrowings of up to  consisting of borrowings under a three year revolving line of credit of up to  and a five year  senior secured term loan facility term loan 
on june   the company negotiated an extension of the revolving line of credit portion of the credit facility to july  on december   the company entered into an amendment that allowed the repurchase of capital stock of the company and modified the calculation of the maximum amount of capital expenditures and the operating cash flow ratio 
there were no other changes to the credit facility 
the term loan matures in quarterly increments through june the company is also required to pay an amount equal to of the excess cash flow  as defined  for each fiscal year in the event that the funded debt ratio for each of the preceding four fiscal quarters was greater than to the funded debt ratio is defined as total funded debt divided by ebitda 
this payment is first used to reduce the term loan with any remaining amounts used to reduce the revolving line of credit 
the company made excess cash flow payments of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
no excess cash flow payment was required for the year ended december  as of december   there was  outstanding under the term loan and  outstanding under the revolving line of credit  and the unused balance under the revolving line of credit was  the average interest rate was approximately at december
