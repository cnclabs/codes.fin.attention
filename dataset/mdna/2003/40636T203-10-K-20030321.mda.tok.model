item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
hrp believes that the following of its accounting policies fit this description page of liquidity and capital resources continued impairment of long lived assets hrp reviews for impairment losses on its real estate assets when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
if such indication is noted  an undiscounted cash flow analysis is performed  and in the event undiscounted cash flow estimated to be generated by an asset over the remaining depreciable life of that asset is less than its carrying value  then the asset would be written down to its fair value 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
significant assumptions used in this process include an evaluation of leases in place  future rental and occupancy rates  and the level of expected operating expenses 
for the three years ended december   hrp has not recorded a write down or impairment of the carrying value of any real estate property based on these calculations 
assets held for sale should hrp decide to sell a property and actively commence the disposal process  all of the assets  liabilities  income  and expenses associated with such property will be segregated in the financial statements 
at such time  an evaluation for potential impairment will be made using an estimate of the selling price less selling costs 
revenue recognition sfas no 
accounting for leases requires management to estimate the economic life of lease payments 
however  this does not require subjective input by management  as rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term  as defined in each respective lease 
adjustments to convert cash rental income which may include free rent  reduced rent  or periodic rental rate increases over the term of the lease to straight line rental income increased revenues by   and  in   and  respectively 
other accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financials statements in item the policies listed are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in the application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result than those recorded and reported

the loans require the properties securing each loan to maintain a liquidity ratio  specifically a debt service coverage ratio

with respect to the properties encumbered by these loans  hrp cannot incur additional debt 
also  hrp s ability to sell a property  or a portion thereof  is limited because of the requirement to substitute collateral with substantial penalty 
these loans also  under certain circumstances  may restrict the ability of hrp to merge  to consolidate or to liquidate

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on july   hrp sold its interest rate swap agreement for  hrp had entered into the interest rate swap agreement in to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates for the loan secured by allfirst building 
this interest rate swap agreement effectively fixed the loan s cash interest rate at  as opposed to the mortgage loan interest rate of libor plus or at the time of the swap agreement sale 
the proceeds from the sale were designated for general working capital purposes 
for financial reporting purposes  the proceeds are being amortized over the life of the loan as a reduction to interest expense 
during  as the result of the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  hrp reclassified the remaining unamortized gain from liabilities to accumulated other comprehensive income 
the proceeds will continue to be amortized over the life of allfirst building s mortgage payable as a reduction to interest expense 
as of december  and  the unamortized balance  included on the balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive income  was  and  respectively 
also on july  and in connection with the sale of the swap agreement  hrp purchased an interest rate cap for allfirst building s mortgage loan for  which limits hrp s exposure to changing interest rates to a maximum of

allfirst building s cash interest rate was and as of december  and  respectively 
the interest rate cap is a derivative and designated as a cash flow hedge 
hedge effectiveness is measured based on using the intrinsic value of the interest rate cap 
all changes in the fair value of the time value of the cap are recorded directly to earnings 
with the january  adoption of sfas no 
 hrp recorded the cumulative effect of the adoption as a reduction to income of  or the amount of the difference between the carrying value as of january  of  and the then estimated fair value of  all of which represented change in time value 
thereafter  on a quarterly basis  hrp has recorded changes in the estimated fair value of the cap in interest expense 
as of december  and  the estimated fair value of the interest rate cap was  and  respectively 
other than allfirst building s mortgage  all mortgages have fixed interest rates 
accordingly  changes in libor or the prime rate do not significantly impact the amount of interest paid by hrp 
assuming a basis point  or  change in libor  interest paid by hrp would increase or decrease by  on an annual basis
