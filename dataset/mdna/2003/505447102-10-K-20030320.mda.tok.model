this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry

overview we were organized in in connection with the reorganization of labranche co 
from partnership to corporate form and the related initial public offering of our common stock 
we currently view our business as operating principally in two separate segments the specialist segment and the execution and clearing segment 
our specialist segment operates as a specialist in equities and rights on the nyse and in equities and options on the amex  a market maker in etfs on the amex  and provides support services for our specialist activities 
our execution and clearing segment provides securities clearing  securities execution and other related services to its own retail customers  customers of introducing brokers and institutional customers  including traders  professional investors and broker dealers 
our execution and clearing segment also provides direct access floor brokerage services to institutional customers 
certain revenues and administrative and corporate overhead expenses  which consist primarily of interest on our public debt  are not specifically related to our two principal business segments  and thus are treated as other revenues and expenses 
our specialist segment currently includes the operations of our labranche co 
llc  lsp and bv subsidiaries 
our execution and clearing segment currently includes the operations of our lfsi subsidiary 
our business has grown considerably during the past five years 
our revenues increased from million in to million in  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
reorganization transactions as of december   our henderson brothers  inc henderson brothers and internet trading technologies  inc itti subsidiaries were merged with and into our robb peck mccooey clearing corporation rpm clearing corporation subsidiary 
rpm clearing corporation then changed its name to lfsi in january completed acquisition on october   we acquired all the outstanding stock of hochstin company  inc hochstin  which conducted a rights specialist and floor brokerage business on the nyse  for an aggregate of million in cash 
of the million consideration  million was paid at the closing and the remainder is to be paid by us as follows a million on each of october   and  and b million on october   although the final payment may be reduced to  if the employment with us of a certain former employee of hochstin is either terminated by us for cause or is terminated by such employee voluntarily prior to october  the hochstin acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets of approximately million was allocated to goodwill 
recent developments in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not believe the implementation of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin details the required disclosures to be made about obligations under certain issued guarantees and requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements ending after december  we do not believe the implementation of fin will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides two additional methods for accounting for stock based compensation  the modified prospective and the retroactive restatement methods  by an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  in addition to the prospective method required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
prior to january   we elected to account for stock based employee compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as permitted by sfas no 
under apb no 
 compensation expense is not recognized for stock options that have no intrinsic value on the date of grant 
in october  however  our board of directors approved the implementation of procedures to account for stock based employee compensation issued on or after january  in accordance with the prospective fair value method 
under this new method  compensation expense will be recognized over the related service period based on the fair value of stock options on the date of grant 
we do not believe the implementation of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
we are evaluating the potential impact of sfas no 
on future awards of stock based compensation 
please see footnote no 
in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity vie if the company has variable interests that give it a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns of the entity 
fin is effective immediately for vies created after january  we do not believe the implementation of fin will have a material impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies all of our principal securities transactions and the related gains and losses are recorded on a trade date basis 
customer securities transactions and the related revenues and expenses are recorded on a settlement date basis 
corporate equities  options and other securities owned  and securities sold  but not yet purchased are reflected at market value and unrealized gains and losses are reflected in net gain on principal transactions 
united states government obligations  together with related interest receivable as reported in other assets  are reflected at market value  with interest income included in other income 
the market value for the equity securities for which we act as specialist on both the amex and nyse is based on the closing price posted by the exchange on which they are traded 
the market value for etfs and futures contracts is also based on the closing price posted on the exchange on which they are traded 
the market value of our exchange traded options is based on the national best bid offer as determined by our options clearing agent 
investments in non marketable securities consist of private equity  limited liability company and limited partnership investments  and are included in other assets on the statement of financial condition 
these investments do not have readily available price quotations 
these investments are accounted for under the equity method  which approximates fair value  or are accounted for at fair value as estimated by our management 
in determining the estimated fair value  we considered all appropriate factors relevant to such investments and consistently apply industry standard methodology for arriving at fair value 
gains and losses for changes in fair value are included in other revenues in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
our balance sheet contains significant intangible assets 
these intangible assets are comprised of our specialist stock lists  trade name and goodwill acquired in connection with our various acquisitions and the limited partner buyout that occurred in in connection with our reorganization from partnership to corporate form 
the allocations of purchase price and determinations of useful lives were based on independent appraisals for all acquisitions through march the useful lives of the acquired specialist stock lists were determined based on analysis of historical turnover characteristics of the specialist stocks comprising these lists 
for acquisitions subsequent to march  the allocations of purchase price and determinations of useful lives were based on management s analysis of revenues  consideration paid  common stock listings and other relevant data and ratios 
this information was analyzed and compared with the results of the independent appraisals conducted on acquisitions prior to april since the implementation of sfas no 
on january   acquired trade name and goodwill are no longer amortized  instead these assets are tested at least annually for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
our acquired specialist stock lists  however  continue to be amortized over their respective lives 
accordingly since january  we have ceased amortization of acquired goodwill and trade name 
during  management performed the required impairment tests and determined that there was no impairment of our intangible assets 
it is possible that in the future  as a result of periodic testing  we may incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets recorded in our financial statements 
we test goodwill for impairment on a regular basis or when events and circumstances indicate a revision may be necessary by applying a fair value based test 
the fair value test involves the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using both our market capitalization and the present value of our estimated future cash flows based on certain management assumptions 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  we will determine if impairment is necessary through additional testing 
additionally  we test our specialist stock lists and trade name intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value of the specialist stock lists and trade name exceeds their fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized for the excess of carrying value over fair value 
repurchase of our preferred stock on january   we offered to repurchase up to  shares of our outstanding series a preferred stock for  per share  plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to but not including the date of purchase 
on february   the offer expired  and on february   we purchased all the approximately  shares that had been tendered for approximately million  including accrued but unpaid dividends

the following table sets forth the credit ratings on both of these issues as of december  moody s investors services standard poor s senior notes baa bb senior subordinated notes ba bb cash flows our cash flows are primarily related to our specialist trading activities  as well as our financing activities related to the expansion of our business 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents of million represented an increase of million during this increase resulted from million provided by our operating activities  offset by million used for investing activities  including the hochstin acquisition in october cash of million was used for financing activities  primarily for repayment of indebtedness and the repurchase of shares of our series a preferred stocks 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents of million represented a decrease of million during this decrease resulted from million used for our operating activities  offset by million provided by our investing activities  including acquisitions during in which we issued shares of our common stock 
cash of million was also used by financing activities  primarily from the repayment of indebtedness  which was offset by the exercise of stock options by our employees 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents of million represented an increase of million during this increase resulted from million provided by our operating activities and million provided by our financing activities  as a result of the issuance of our senior subordinated notes  offset by million used for our investing activities  mainly our acquisitions during certain risk factors in light of the economic downturn over the past three years and the terrorist attacks on the united states in september  we believe that the following risk factors could have a significant impact on our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
if any of these events actually occur  our business  financial condition  operating results and or cash flows could be adversely affected 
our revenues may decrease due to changes affecting the economy  such as increases in interest rates or inflation  or changes affecting the securities markets  such as decreased volume or liquidity 
an adverse change affecting the economy or the securities markets could result in a decline in market volume or liquidity 
this would result in lower revenues from our specialist and execution and clearing activities 
historically  increases in our revenues have resulted primarily from significant increases in the volume of trading on the nyse and favorable conditions in the securities markets 
more recently  however  the economy has slowed and financial markets have become less prosperous in comparison to the immediately preceding several years 
if this causes a decline in market volume  or if market liquidity becomes compromised  our revenues could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
continued global and us economic downturn and declines in price levels of securities could cause us to incur losses 
the difficult global market and economic conditions that existed during deteriorated further throughout although began with increased expectations of improved economic performance  weak corporate earnings  continuing uncertainty about the strength and pace of the global economic recovery and continued reports of corporate accounting and governance irregularities have undermined investor confidence  and the equity markets in which we operate experienced sharp declines during uncertainty surrounding lingering terrorist threats and increased geopolitical tensions also have contributed to investors becoming increasingly risk averse 
these conditions affected our results of operations and may adversely affect our operations in the future 
us equity markets declined for the third consecutive year and adverse changes in the economy and the securities markets have led to lower price levels of securities 
continued declines in these price levels have resulted in and could continue to result in losses from declines in the market value of securities held in our accounts  the failure of buyers and sellers of securities to fulfill their settlement obligations  and increases in claims and litigation 
it currently is uncertain when these market and economic conditions will improve or whether we will be able to adequately protect our interests or maintain revenues throughout this period 
our results may fluctuate significantly 
our revenues may fluctuate significantly based on factors relating to the securities markets 
these factors include a significant decrease in trading volume on the nyse and the amex  volatility in the equity securities markets  and changes in the value of our securities positions 
many elements of our cost structure do not decline if we experience reductions in our revenues 
as a result  if market conditions cause our revenues to decline  we may be unable to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis and we could suffer losses 
long term downturns in the economy or the equity markets in general could cause trading volumes and revenues to decline and cause our operating results to suffer 
recent terrorist attacks have contributed to economic instability in the united states  continued terrorist attacks  war or other civil disturbances could lead to further economic instability and depress our stock price 
on september   the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope  with the attacks in new york city particularly affecting our operations 
these attacks may cause long term instability in the global financial markets 
the united states is also currently conducting military operations in response to the terrorist attacks and is also currently contemplating military operations against iraq 
these attacks and the united states military campaign may lead to substantial armed hostilities  war or further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the united states or elsewhere  which may contribute further to economic instability in the united states and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our offices are located in close proximity to the terrorist attacks on the world trade center on september  the aftermath of the attacks on the world trade center required us to close our operations and temporarily operate from our disaster recovery site 
the nyse also was forced to stop operating for four consecutive trading days  which caused our operations to halt and could have compromised the liquidity of that market during closure 
if additional terrorist attacks occur in close proximity to our offices  or upon our office buildings  the nyse or the amex  we could be forced to relocate for a longer period of time  or permanently 
furthermore  additional terrorist attacks in new york city  or on our buildings  the nyse or the amex  or additional armed hostilities within the united states  could cause significant delays or stoppages in our business activities  which would significantly harm our revenues and profits 
our information or communication systems may fail and interrupt our business 
any information or communication systems failure or decrease in information or communications systems performance that causes interruptions in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and or operating results 
our systems may fail as a result of hardware or software failure  or power or telecommunications failure 
the september  terrorist attacks  particularly the attacks on the world trade center  caused a temporary lapse in some of our information and communications systems 
it is possible that additional terrorist attacks may occur in the future and that such attacks could compromise or disable our systems 
although we have established back up disaster recovery centers in new jersey and new york  they may not be effective in preventing an interruption of our business 
it is also possible that any future terrorist activities or an act of war in retaliation against the current united states military activities could harm our operations and or disaster recovery centers  which could significantly harm our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because our specialist equity activities on the nyse and amex expose our capital to significant risks  managing these risks is a constant priority for us 
our central role in the auction process helps us to reduce risks by enabling us to incorporate up to date market information in the management of our inventory  subject to our specialist obligations 
we have developed a risk management process which is designed to balance our ability to profit from our specialist activities with our exposure to potential losses 
our risk management process includes participation by our executive operating committee  our floor management committee  our floor team captains and our specialists 
these parties roles are described as follows executive operating committee 
our executive operating committee is composed of four executive officers of labranche co 
llc 
this committee is responsible for approving all risk management policies and trading guidelines for particular specialist stocks  after receiving input and proposals by the floor management committee 
in addition  our executive operating committee reviews all unusual situations reported to it by our floor management committee 
floor management committee 
our floor management committee is composed of seven senior floor specialists 
this committee is responsible for formulating and overseeing our overall risk management policies and risk guidelines for each of our specialist stocks 
in arriving at these policies and guidelines  our floor management committee considers the advice and input of our floor team captains 
our floor management committee meets with all floor team captains no less than once a month to review and  if necessary  revise the risk management policies for our firm as a whole and or for particular specialist stocks 
in addition  a member of our floor management committee is always available on the trading floor to review and assist with any unusual situations reported by a captain 
our floor management committee reports to our executive operating committee about each of these situations 
floor team captains 
we have floor team captains who monitor the activities of our specialists throughout the trading day from various positions at our trading posts 
the captains observe trades and constantly review trading positions on a real time basis through our information systems 
in addition  the captains are readily available to assist our specialists in determining when to deviate from our policies and guidelines to react to any unusual situations or market conditions 
the captains must report these unusual situations to management  including any deviations from our policies and guidelines 
captains meet with each specialist at least once a week to evaluate the specialist s adherence to our risk management policies and guidelines 
captains also meet among themselves at least twice weekly to review risk policies and guidelines and  if appropriate  make new recommendations to the floor management committee 
specialists 
our specialists conduct auctions based upon the conditions of the marketplace 
in doing so  specialists observe our risk management policies and guidelines notwithstanding their responsibility to create a fair and orderly market 
specialists must immediately notify a captain of any unusual situations or market conditions requiring a deviation from our policies and guidelines 
due to the relative size of our equity specialist operations on the amex  which consists of five equity specialists  formal risk committees do not exist 
nevertheless  our amex equity specialists adhere to all risk management policies set by the executive operating committee  and are in constant communication with the executive officers of labranche co 
llc 
circuit breaker rules 
the nyse and amex have instituted certain circuit breaker rules intended to halt trading in all nyse amex listed stocks in the event of a severe market decline 
the circuit breaker rules impose temporary halts in trading when the dow jones industrial average drops a certain number of points 
current circuit breaker levels are set quarterly at  and percent of the dow jones industrial average closing values of the previous month  rounded to the nearest points 
these rules provide investors extra time to respond to severe market declines and provide us an opportunity to insure compliance with our risk management policies

the percentage of labranche co

labranche co 
llc is not overly reliant on a particular group of specialist stocks  as the composition of its ten and twenty five most profitable specialist stocks changes continuously 
our specialist activities are subject to a number of risks  including risks of price fluctuations  rapid changes in the liquidity of markets and foreign exchange risk related to adrs 
in any period  we may incur trading losses in our specialist stocks for a variety of reasons  including price fluctuations of our specialist stocks  lack of trading volume in our specialist stocks and the performance of our specialist obligations 
from time to time  we may have large position concentrations in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry 
in general  because our inventory of securities is marked to market on a daily basis  any significant price movement in these securities could result in a reduction of our revenues and operating profits 
we have developed a risk management process  which is intended to balance our ability to profit from our specialist activities with our exposure to potential losses 
we have invested substantial capital  along with the nyse  in real time  on line systems which give management instant access to specific trading information at any time during the trading day  including our aggregate long and short positions and our capital and profit and loss information on an aggregate or per issue basis

as is true with labranche co 
llc s equity trading  lsp s options and etf trading exposes it to certain risks  such as price fluctuations and changes in the liquidity of markets 
in addition  these derivative instruments expose lsp to volatility risk  among other types of risks 
in order to manage these risks lsp has a risk management team 
these individuals utilize a third party software application to monitor its positions on a real time basis 
by monitoring actual and theoretical profit and loss  volatility and other standard risk measures  these individuals insure all lsp traders are within the parameters set by management 
lsp s traders use futures and the stocks underlying certain positions in an attempt to hedge market risk 
the firm s aggregate risk is under constant evaluation by both the risk management team and traders  and all significant trading strategies and positions are discussed between both groups 
lsp s options trading is executed solely on national exchanges 
these trades clear through the options clearing corporation  thereby reducing potential credit risk

for current customers  lfsi seeks to control the risks associated with customer activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines 
lfsi monitors margin levels daily and pursuant to such guidelines  requires customers to deposit additional collateral or to reduce positions when necessary 
in addition  lfsi performs a background check on every customer 
in each of our segments  we rely heavily on our information systems in conducting our risk management and therefore we ve made significant investments in our trade processing and execution systems 
our use of and dependence on technology has allowed us to sustain our significant growth over the past several years 
management members and floor captains must constantly monitor our positions and transactions in order to mitigate our risks and identify troublesome trends as they occur

implementation consisted of the distribution of a manual defining the roles and responsibilities of various individuals within our organization in the event of a disruption to our business  as well as a detailed plan for the communication and dissemination of information throughout our organization 
as part of our disaster recovery plan  we enhanced our back up disaster recovery center in new jersey which primarily services our labranche co 
llc subsidiary 
the back up system operates as a hot site  simultaneously receiving the same information as transmitted to our primary computer system in new york city 
in addition  we have established complete connectivity between our new york city and new jersey facilities 
we test both systems on a regular basis to assure that they are fully operational 
currently  lfsi is under contract with a third party service bureau to provide disaster recovery services 
we are in the process of establishing a second back up facility which will serve our lfsi and lsp subsidiaries in another new york state location so that our primary new york city operations are safeguarded from potential business interruption 
this site will also act as a secondary disaster recovery facility for our labranche co
