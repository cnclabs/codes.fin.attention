item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading designer and marketer of licensed motorsports products related to nascar  including die cast scaled replicas of motorsports vehicles  apparel  and memorabilia 
we currently have exclusive license agreements with many of the most recognized names in nascar 
we also design and sell products relating to other motorsports  including racing sanctioned by the nhra  formula one  the irl  iroc  and the world of outlaws 
in germany  we merchandise formula one and high end auto manufacturer die cast replica vehicles 
we work closely with drivers  team owners  track operators  and sponsors to design and merchandise our products 
third parties manufacture all of the replica motorsports vehicles and most apparel and memorabilia  generally utilizing our designs  tools  and dies 
we retain ownership and control over designs and tooling and have close working relationships with our third party manufacturers to help assure product quality 
we have structured our operations to enable us to respond to challenging business conditions and to service higher levels of sales with limited increases in operating expenses and capital investments 
the principal elements of this operating structure include the following we have the ability to exert a high degree of control over product pricing 
manufacturing costs are largely fixed due to outsourcing under fixed price contracts 

table of contents royalties are paid generally as a percentage of sales 
due to our agreements with distributors and qvc  incremental volume does not proportionately increase our operating expenses 
research and development is limited to basic design and engineering 
capital expenditures are principally limited to tooling for die cast 
functions such as manufacturing and others outside of our core skills are generally outsourced 
revenue we derive revenue primarily from the sale of our licensed motorsports products 
the popularity and performance of drivers and teams under license  the popularity of motorsports in general and nascar in particular  the general demand for licensed sports merchandise  and our ability to design  produce  and distribute our products in a timely manner influence the level of our net sales 
we distribute our products through a broad range of channels  including a network of wholesale distributors  leading mass market retailers  mobile trackside stores  qvc  and our collectors club catalog 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title passes to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
most distributor sales are recognized when product is shipped to a distributor because title to the product passes to the distributors at shipment 
sales to mass market retailers are recognized when title to product passes to the retailer  either at time of shipment to the retailer or receipt by the retailer 
under terms of our consignment agreement with qvc  collectors club catalog sales are recognized when qvc ships product to the consumer 
we recognize trackside sales when the consumer purchases product at the point of sale 
a portion of the product sold through television programming is consignment product  for which sales are recognized when qvc ships the product to the consumer 
internet and other sales are generally recognized when delivered to the consumer 
cost of sales cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of products procured from third party manufacturers  royalty payments to licensors  depreciation of tooling and dies  and freight charges 
substantial portions of our die cast products are manufactured under an exclusive agreement with early light  a third party manufacturer in china 
we obtain substantially all of our apparel and memorabilia products from several third party manufacturers and suppliers 
most of the components of our cost of sales are variable in nature 
however  certain factors do affect our gross margin  including the following product mix  our ability to price our product appropriately  the effect of amortizing the fixed cost components of cost of sales  primarily depreciation of tooling and dies  over varying levels of net sales  the type of freight charges  and additional charges related to lower than minimum order quantities and cancellation of specific purchase orders 

table of contents selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  advertising and promotion  rent and other facility costs  and depreciation and amortization 
the majority of these costs are fixed and  as a result  incremental sales volume generally results in a decline in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
seasonality because the auto racing season is concentrated between the months of february and november  the second and third calendar quarters of each year our third and fourth fiscal quarters are historically characterized by higher sales 
application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
during preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  royalties  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
our accounts receivable are written off against the allowance once the account is deemed to be uncollectable 
this typically occurs once we have exhausted all efforts to collect the account  which includes collection attempts by company employees and outside collection agencies 
inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents licenses and royalties our license agreements generally require payments of royalties to drivers  sponsors  teams  and other parties 
contracts generally provide for royalties to be calculated as a specified percentage of sales 
some contracts  however  provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments 
royalties payable calculated using the contract percentage rates are recognized as cost of sales when the related sales are recognized 
to the extent we project that royalties payable under a contract  calculated using the contract rate  will be lower than guaranteed minimums during the guarantee period  we recognize additional cost of sales over the guarantee period  generally a calendar year 
guarantees advanced under the license agreements are carried as prepaid royalties until earned by the third party  or considered to be unrecoverable 
we evaluate prepaid royalties regularly and expense prepaid royalties to cost of sales to the extent projected to be unrecoverable through sales 
goodwill and other intangibles we evaluate goodwill and other intangibles for impairment annually  and when impairment indicators arise  in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
for goodwill  we first compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit  additional tests would be used to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we use a present value technique to measure reporting unit fair value 
if the carrying amount of any other intangible asset exceeds its fair value  we would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between fair value and the carrying amount 
we have not recognized any impairment losses to date 
if events occur and circumstances change  causing the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount  impairment losses may be recognized in the future 
deferred tax assets we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with the temporary differences that have resulted from the differing treatment of items dictated by generally accepted accounting principles versus us and german tax laws 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we were to believe the recovery was less than likely  we would establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset and charge the amount as an income tax expense in the period in which such a determination was made 
stock based compensation we account for employee stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations apb no 

common stock options issued under our plans generally do not result in compensation expense because the exercise price of the stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
were we required to record compensation expense for these options  we would record a charge to earnings which might be significant

table of contents year ended september  compared with year ended september  net sales decreased to million for  from million in domestic die cast sales decreased million  or  from the prior year while foreign die cast sales increased million  or 
domestic wholesale distribution and promotion die cast revenues were down in part due to the four month delay in producing monte carlo and pontiac products arising from the retooling of those products  and in part due to reduced special paint scheme product volumes resulting from the lack of high impact specials and the economic environment 
mass merchant retail domestic die cast revenues were down because our largest customer ordered virtually no product for delivery in the second half of although shipping to this customer has resumed  we cannot predict order levels from this customer 
the increase in foreign die cast sales approximated the change in the average euro to us dollar exchange rate between and the increase in domestic apparel and memorabilia segment sales  exclusive of trackside was million  or from the prior year  and included a million increase from businesses acquired in trackside sales decreased to million from revenues of million in the prior year 
trackside revenues were impacted by adverse weather conditions and a weak economy 
gross profit declined to of sales in from in the decline in domestic margin was attributable to die cast product cost increases  the impact of largely fixed tooling costs on lower die cast volumes  increased freight expenses  and a program to reduce apparel and other specialty inventories before the end of fiscal foreign die cast margins were lower as a result of higher tooling depreciation 
these declines in gross margin were partially offset by the impact of higher margin apparel sales being a larger component of total sales in compared to selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in selling  general  and administrative expenses increased principally as a result of higher promotional expenses  increased commissions  a million charge related to the settlement of a mediation proceeding  and a million receivable allowance provision for one customer with overdue invoices

domestic die cast sales increased from the prior year while foreign die cast sales increased 
sales of die cast products to mass retailers under the winner s circle brand  purchased in june  accounted for of the increase in domestic die cast sales 
the remaining increase in domestic die cast sales reflects a continuation of the increase in consumer demand  which began in the second quarter of domestic apparel and memorabilia segment sales  exclusive of trackside  increased million  or  from the prior year

in addition  segments generally benefited from stable costs and increased volume

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk associated with our credit instruments and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with operations in germany 
at september   we had million outstanding under our convertible subordinated notes at an interest rate of and approximately million of debt outstanding at various rates and terms  principally under promissory notes and capital leases 
interest rates on these credit instruments are fixed and comparable to current market rates 
the functional currency for our foreign operation is the euro 
as such  changes in exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar could adversely affect our future earnings 
given the level of income we currently derive from our foreign operations  we consider exposure to be minimal 
we currently use a derivative as part of our risk management strategy related to a portion of our exposure to currency fluctuations on intercompany advances to our german subsidiary  denominated in dollars  for which the euro exchange rate gain or loss is included in operations 
these advances totaled million at september  in june  we entered into a foreign currency forward contract designed to partially offset the effect changes in the euro exchange rate have on earnings related to these advances 
this forward contract does not qualify for hedge accounting and is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in fair value are recorded each period in other income expense 
at september   this forward with a notional value of million euros million as of september   remained unsettled 
the notional amount does not quantify risk or represent our liability  but is used in calculation of cash settlements under the contract 
during  thousand of net unrealized losses on the contract were recorded in other income expense 
we realized a thousand loss on the contract upon settlement at maturity in november in november  we entered into another forward contract with a notional value of million euros  and a six month maturity 
we are exposed to credit risk on this contract in the event of non performance by the counterparty 
however  the counterparty to this transaction is a major financial institution we deem credit worthy 
we do not anticipate non performance
