overview mdsi develops  markets  implements and supports mobile workforce management and wireless connectivity software for use by a wide variety of companies that have substantial mobile workforces  such as utilities  telecommunications and cable broadband companies 
mdsi s products are used by such companies in conjunction with public and private wireless data communications networks to provide comprehensive solutions for the automation of business processes associated with the scheduling  dispatching and management of a mobile workforce

restructuring the company believes that economic conditions and trends have adversely affected and may continue to affect levels of capital spending by companies in a variety of industries  including companies in the vertical markets that the company serves 
the current excess supply of capacity in the telecommunications industry has adversely affected the financial condition of many telecommunications companies worldwide 
in addition  economic conditions and developments in the energy markets have had an adverse effect on the financial condition of energy and utility companies in certain geographic areas of north america 
the company believes that these and other factors have adversely affected demand for products and services offered by the company  as certain prospective and existing customers have delayed or deferred purchasing decisions or have sought to terminate existing contracts for the company s products and services 
while the company believes that economic conditions in certain of its vertical markets show signs of improvement  the company believes that economic and political conditions and general trends are likely to continue to affect the demand for the company s products and services in  particularly demand for software and related services 
such factors may also increase the amount of doubtful accounts or adversely affect the likelihood of collection of such accounts 
in order to address the uncertainties caused by these economic trends  mdsi announced in march its intention to reduce its operating expenses through workforce reductions and other measures 
these measures have been gradually implemented with incremental reductions in costs each quarter  and were expected to result in an estimated million in cost reductions per quarter by the end of a majority of the savings have been realized by reduced salary and payroll costs  and the remaining savings have been realized from the subleasing of excess space  and a reduction in discretionary spending 
as a result of the sale of the public safety operations during the second quarter of  the company has exceeded the estimated quarterly savings 
there can be no assurance that the workforce reductions and other measures will not have a material adverse affect on the company s business operations 
in connection with this restructuring  on march   mdsi terminated employee and contractor positions in canada and the united states 
on may   the company continued the restructuring by announcing the elimination of an additional positions  which in combination with the workforce reductions of march  amounted to approximately of mdsi s staff as of march  the company recorded a one time charge of million in the first quarter of relating to the workforce reductions  and leasing of excess office space 
the company also recorded an additional charge of approximately million in the second quarter of relating to elimination of positions  leasing of excess office space  and fixed asset write downs announced on may  a breakdown of the nature of the charges and the costs incurred to date is as follows total restructuring charge workforce reduction  provision for excess office space  non cash write down of capital assets  other  total restructuring charges  cumulative draw downs  accrued restructuring charges as at december   during the year ended december  the company made cash payments of  relating to the restructuring accruals 
workforce reduction charges of million were taken relating to severance and continued benefits for the elimination of positions across all operating departments and segments of the organization 
as of december   the provision balance has been fully drawn down by cash payments with no additional amounts expected to be paid out 
the provision for excess office space of million for the year ended december   relates to surplus office space under long term lease by the company at two locations  where the company has entered into fixed cost lease arrangements  with agreements extending up to the company has incurred approximately million of cash costs relating to this provision leaving an accrual of million as at december  the company expects that the charge will be fully drawn down no later than the time the lease expires in the fourth quarter of due to the elimination of positions  certain capital assets belonging to the company have been declared surplus and a charge of million has been recorded to reflect the difference between the previous carrying value and the estimated fair market value  net of disposal costs 
as at december  the full amount of the charge has been applied to the assets to value them at their estimated net realizable value 
the company has recorded a million charge for the year ended december  for other items  including costs of outplacement services and legal and consulting fees 
as at december   the company has incurred cash costs of approximately million against this provision  with no additional amounts expected to be paid out 
field service business the implementation of a complete mobile data solution requires a wireless data communications network  mobile computing devices integrated with wireless data communication modems  host computer equipment  industry specific application software such as mdsi s advantex products  wireless connectivity software and a variety of services to manage and install these components  integrate them with an organization s existing computer systems and configure or customize the software to meet customer requirements 
frequently  in the company s larger contracts only a limited number of the mobile computing devices and in vehicle equipment are installed initially  with the balance implemented over a rollout period that may extend up to one year or more 
where increases in mobile workforces require or where additional departments of mobile workers are added  additional mobile computing devices may be installed  which may result in additional revenue for the company 
see forward looking statements 
revenue for software and services has historically accounted for a substantial portion of the company s revenue 
typically  the company enters into a fixed price contract with a customer for the licensing of selected software products and the provision of specific services that are generally performed within six to twelve months 
pricing for these contracts includes license fees as well as a fee for professional services 
the company generally recognizes total revenue for software and services associated with a contract using a percentage of completion method based on the total costs incurred over the total estimated costs to complete the contract 
the company s customers typically enter into ongoing maintenance agreements that provide for maintenance and technical support services for a period commencing after expiration of the initial warranty period 
maintenance agreements typically have a term of one to three years and are invoiced either annually  quarterly  or monthly 
revenue for these services is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
the company is periodically required to provide  in addition to mdsi products and services  certain third party products  such as host computer hardware and operating system software  and mobile computing devices 
the company recognizes revenue on the supply of third party hardware and software upon transfer of title to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue on the supply of third party services using a percentage of completion method based on the costs incurred over the total estimated cost to complete the third party services contract 
the company believes that it will periodically supply third party products and services to customers where it is successful in selling its own products and services 
there can be no assurance  however  that any contracts entered into by the company to supply third party software and products in the future will represent a substantial portion of revenue in any future period 
since the revenue generated from the supply of third party products and services may represent a significant portion of certain contracts and the installation and rollout of third party products is generally at the discretion of the customer  the company may  depending on the level of third party products and services provided during a period  experience large fluctuations in revenue 
during  mdsi decided not to continue pursuing opportunities in the public safety market 
these opportunities consisted of federal  state and local agencies that provide police  fire  medical and other emergency services 
the company had installed solutions for a limited number of customers  and this market did not represent a material portion of mdsi s revenues 
on may  the company entered into an agreement with datamaxx applied technologies inc datamaxx  granting exclusive license to datamaxx for mdsi s public safety products in north america  and non exclusive license rights for these products outside north america 
the company also assigned its existing contracts in the public safety market to datamaxx 
mdsi will receive royalty payments under the agreement for any license and implementation revenue earned by datamaxx in relation to the licensed products  subject to a maximum royalty payout of  as a result of this licensing agreement  the company has now exited the public safety market  and all employees related to the public safety market were terminated prior to june  the company s revenue is dependent  in large part  on significant contracts from a limited number of customers 
as a result  any substantial delay in the company s completion of a contract  the inability of the company to obtain new contracts or the cancellation of an existing contract by a customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
some of the company s contracts are cancelable upon notice by the customer 
the loss of certain contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate from period to period 
disposition of hosting and information technology it services business segment in june  mdsi adopted a plan for sale and entered into an agreement to sell its hosting and it services business segment  connectria corporation connectria to former connectria shareholders who were both shareholders and employees of the company

in addition to the share consideration  a wholly owned subsidiary of mdsi also received a warrant allowing it to purchase up to  shares of series a nonvoting preferred stock of connectria at a price of per share exercisable for a period of five years 
the series a nonvoting preferred stock of connectria has a face value of per share  bears a dividend of five percent per annum  bears a liquidation preference equal to the face value  may be redeemed at connectria s option at any time  and must be redeemed by connectria upon a capital infusion of million or greater 
in addition mdsi has advanced connectria  consisting of a loan in the principal amount of  with a two year term  bearing interest at  and  for prepaid hosting services 
on closing  the company realized a small gain as a result of the disposition of connectria 
as a result of its decision to dispose of connectria  mdsi has treated this business segment as a discontinued operation and the results of operations  financial position and changes in cash flow for this segment have been segregated from those of continuing operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the company s results of operations excludes connectria for the current and corresponding prior periods

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that the liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at its fair value when the liability is incurred 
under previous guidance  a liability for certain exit costs was recognized at the date that management committed to an exit plan  which was generally before the actual liability had been incurred 
as sfas is effective only for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   adoption of this statement will not impact the company s financial statements for fiscal but will affect the accounting and recognition of any future restructuring costs 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
fin also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued 
the recognition provisions of fin will be effective for any guarantees that are issued or modified after december  the company is currently evaluating the effects of fin  however  it does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position

critical accounting policies and significant estimates the significant accounting policies are outlined within note to the financial statements 
some of those accounting policies require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported by the company 
the following items require the most significant judgment and involve complex estimation restructuring charges in calculating the cost to dispose of excess facilities the company was required to estimate for each location the amount to be paid in lease termination payments  the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated  and the amount  if any  of sublease revenues 
this required estimating the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated  the amount of operating costs  and the timing and rate at which the company might be able to sublease the site 
from the estimates for these costs the company performed an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site

these estimates and contracts are reviewed regularly and are adjusted prospectively to reflect the company s best estimate at the time

the company s assumptions used to form these estimates may be proven to be erroneous and materially different outcomes may result 
income taxes the company has incurred losses and other costs that can be applied against future taxable earnings to reduce the tax liability on those earnings 
as the company is uncertain of realizing the future benefit of those losses and expenditures  the company has recorded a valuation allowance against most non capital loss carry forwards  and other deferred tax assets arising from differences in tax and accounting bases 
actual results may be materially different from the current estimate
