see forward looking statements 
overview revenues our revenues consist of three components net sales  research and development revenue and royalty income 
net sales 
net sales is comprised of sales of biomaterials products and the triactiv device 
biomaterials 
the biomaterials component of net sales represents the sale of our biomaterials products to customers for use in the following markets orthopaedics  cardiology  drug biologics delivery  periodontal  general surgery and wound care 
in  our biomaterials sales were comprised almost of the absorbable and nonabsorbable collagen and polymer components of the angio seal supplied to our strategic alliance partner 
since that time  we have experienced significant sales growth in our biomaterials products as we have expanded our customer base and marketing activities  increased sales to existing customers and assisted in the development of new product offerings 
for fiscal  the angio seal components represented of our total biomaterial sales 
we believe the growth in our overall biomaterials sales  which was in fiscal over fiscal  will continue because of greater acceptance by the medical community of biomaterials and technological advances which have expanded the applications for our biomaterials products 
triactiv 
the triactiv was commercially launched in europe in the fourth quarter of fiscal we are selling direct to the market in germany and through distributors throughout the rest of europe 
we have entered into distribution agreements for sales in the united kingdom  ireland  switzerland  austria  and italy as of june  and are in the process of identifying distributors for the rest of europe 
while triactiv sales were less than of our total sales for fiscal  we anticipate the triactiv will become a more significant component of net sales in fiscal and beyond as we gain new customers in the european markets  launch new versions and applications of the product and launch the product in the us market 
we anticipate commercial launch of triactiv in the us in the second half of fiscal research and development revenue 
fiscal research and development revenue was derived entirely from a single nist grant  under which we are researching cartilage regeneration utilizing our ptm technology 
this grant continued through fiscal and we received all remaining funds under this grant in our second quarter of fiscal in addition  in october we received a second nist grant  under which we are researching a synthetic vascular graft also utilizing our ptm technology 
this project is expected to continue through early fiscal in january  we received a nih grant  under which we are researching sustained or controlled release of chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of breast cancer utilizing our ptm technology 
this grant will continue through early fiscal year royalty income 
we receive a royalty on every angio seal unit sold worldwide 
we anticipate sales of the angio seal will continue to grow as st 
jude medical continues to expand its sales and marketing efforts  including its launch of the angio seal product line in the japanese market  and releases future generations of the angio seal system  including its recent launch of the sts plus version of the device in the us as a result  we expect that royalty income will continue to be a significant source of revenue 
our current royalty rate is 
the original rate of was contractually reduced from to  in accordance with our licensing agreements during the fiscal quarter ended december   when a cumulative one million angio seal units had been sold 
there will be one further decrease in the royalty rate  to  upon reaching four million cumulative units sold 
we anticipate that this final rate reduction will occur in the fourth quarter of our fiscal as of june  approximately three million angio seal units have been sold 
cost of products sold 
we have experienced an overall increase in gross margin during fiscal reflecting the continued increase in volume of biomaterials product sales 
this increased volume  from both our existing customers and new customers  has resulted in manufacturing efficiencies 
the volume increase also results in our fixed costs being spread over a greater number of units 
we anticipate the gross margin on our biomaterials products will continue to improve with continued increased sales volume 
this increase in gross margin will be partially offset by lower gross margins associated with the triactiv  as we expect margins on early sales to be lower than the biomaterials margins due to the start up nature of the manufacturing process and low volume 
as a result of this product mix  for fiscal  we believe our total gross margin  across all product lines  will be only slightly improved over fiscal as volumes increase and the manufacturing process matures for the triactiv  we expect the gross margin on the product to increase 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred for the development of our proprietary technologies  such as the triactiv  absorbable and nonabsorbable biomaterials products and technologies and other development programs  including expenses under the nist and nih programs 
in december  we began our triactiv us pivotal clinical study  a planned to patient randomized trial at up to sites around the us and in europe 
we anticipate completion of trial enrollment and submission to the food and drug administration fda for k approval by the end of the second quarter or early third quarter of fiscal clinical efforts in pursuit of fda approval and continuing development of the triactiv  as well as our continued development of proprietary biomaterials products and technologies  requires significant research and development spending 
we anticipate research and development expense will continue to increase as we pursue commercialization of the triactiv device in the us  and explore opportunities for other indications related to triactiv as well as our other technologies  including the continued development of proprietary biomaterials technologies 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include general and administrative costs as well as costs related to the sales and marketing of our products 
the costs of our patent litigation are also included within selling  general and administrative expenses 
the sales and marketing component of selling  general and administrative expenses has increased as we commercialized the triactiv in europe in may and move toward commercialization of the triactiv in the us in january  we received ce mark approval from the european regulatory authority for the triactiv  which allows commercial sale of the product in the european union 
effective january  we established a subsidiary in germany  kensey nash europe gmbh  and hired a vice president of european sales 
we have established a european sales and marketing team and will continue to add personnel to this team as required to meet our clinical and sales goals 
this team is selling the product direct in the german market and supports our distributor relationships in the rest of europe 
we have entered into distribution agreements for sales in the united kingdom  ireland  switzerland  austria and italy as of june  and are in the process of identifying distributors for the rest of europe 
we anticipate sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we prepare for us commercial launch 
we also continue to evaluate opportunities for commercialization of the triactiv in the us and to expand the marketing efforts for our biomaterials business 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies revenue recognition and accounting for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
accordingly  sales revenue is recognized when the related product is shipped 
all of our shipments are free on board fob shipping point 
revenue under research and development contracts is recognized as the related costs are incurred 
royalty revenue is recognized as the related product is sold 
advance payments received for products or services are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized when the product is shipped or services are performed 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation costs under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
which permits continued application of the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation cost represents the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s common stock at the grant date over the amount the grantee must pay for the stock 
our policy is to grant stock options at the fair market value at the date of grant 
therefore  we have not recognized any compensation expense for options granted to employees 
we account for stock based awards to non employees using the fair value method in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires using black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the option at the original grant date 
options granted to non employees  as defined under sfas  as amended by sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf accounting for equity instruments that are other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  are recorded as expense over the service period 
the company did not grant any options to non employees during fiscal see note to our financial statements for information regarding options granted to a non employee  an outside consultant  in october results of operations comparison of fiscal years and total revenue and net sales 
total revenues increased to million in the year ended june  from million in the year ended june  net sales of products increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal while triactiv sales increased in fiscal over fiscal  they represented less than of total sales for fiscal as such  the increase in total sales was primarily attributable to increased sales of the angio seal components and our orthopaedic products 
research and development revenue 
research and development revenues increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal fiscal revenues were generated under the nist articular cartilage and synthetic vascular graft development grants and the nih breast cancer drug delivery grant 
in the prior fiscal year  revenues were generated under the nist articular cartilage and synthetic vascular graft development grants 
the nist articular cartilage grant provided revenue for four of the twelve months of fiscal  as the project concluded in october the nist vascular graft grant provided revenue for the entire year 
the nih breast cancer drug delivery grant was initiated in september the increase over the prior fiscal year reflects the addition of the nih breast cancer grant which provided  of revenue in fiscal and an increase in the activities and expenses related to the nist synthetic vascular graft grant 
the vascular graft grant revenue increased  in fiscal  from fiscal these increases were offset by a decrease of  in the nist articular cartilage grant due to the conclusion of the grant in early fiscal royalty income 
royalty income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase reflects a greater number of units sold as well as an increase in average selling price for the angio seal 
royalty units increased as approximately  angio seal units were sold to end users during fiscal compared to approximately  units sold during fiscal we believe that this unit increase was primarily due to st 
jude medical s increased sales and marketing efforts  resulting in market share gains for the angio seal product line in both the us and european markets and the full year impact of the self tightening suture sts version of the angio seal  which was introduced in the us in march cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal while gross margin increased to from 
the increase in gross margin reflected the higher margins on our biomaterials products attributable in part to higher volumes which result in manufacturing efficiencies  as well as continued allocation of overhead across greater sales volumes  which results in a decrease in per unit costs 
the higher margins on our biomaterials products were slightly offset by lower margins on the triactiv 
the triactiv margins will continue to be lower than our biomaterials product margins until our manufacturing process matures and volumes increase 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was mainly attributable to our continued development efforts on the triactiv  including clinical trial expenses 
research and development expenses related to the triactiv increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we also continued to expand our development efforts on our biomaterials products including our work under the nist grants 
biomaterials and other proprietary technologies spending increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million  in fiscal this increase was partially the result of increased sales and marketing expenses which increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase related primarily to european sales and marketing efforts on the triactiv 
in addition  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was attributable to  in increased personnel costs and  in increased professional services and public company expenses  including investor relations and filing fees 
these increases were related to our continued sales and research and development growth  but primarily to increased costs related to complying with the sarbanes oxley act of soa 
in addition  selling  general and administrative include a  professional service fee  which relates directly to a research and development tax credit project performed in our fiscal fourth quarter see below 
net interest income 
interest expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this was due to a lower principal balance on the thm acquisition obligation as we continue to make the required quarterly payments and as a result of early repayment to certain debt holders 
interest income decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal although our cash and investment balances increased  this was more than offset by lower interest rates 
other non operating income expense 
other non operating income was for fiscal compared to other non operating expense of  for fiscal other non operating expense income for both periods represented primarily the net loss or gain on the sale of fixed assets 
net income 
net income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was primarily the result of increased sales and royalty income as described above  offset in part by increased expenses associated with research and development and sales and marketing efforts related to the triactiv  also described above 
in addition  the company recognized million in income tax expense in fiscal compared to million of income tax expense in fiscal the tax expense in fiscal was net of a million research and development tax credit described below 
comparison of fiscal years and total revenue and net sales 
total revenues increased to million in the year ended june  from million in the year ended june  net sales of products increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was entirely attributable to increased sales of the angio seal components and our orthopaedic products 
research and development revenue 
research and development revenues increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal fiscal revenues were generated under the nist articular cartilage and synthetic vascular graft development grants 
as the synthetic vascular graft grant was received during fiscal  research and development revenues for the same period a year earlier were generated by work performed on the nist articular cartilage development grant only 
royalty income 
royalty income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase reflects a greater number of units sold as well as an increase in average selling price for the angio seal offset by a decrease in the average royalty rate from approximately in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in the average rate came as a result of a drop in the royalty rate from to in october  as discussed above 
royalty units increased as approximately  angio seal units were sold to end users during fiscal compared to approximately  units sold during fiscal we believe that this unit increase was primarily due to st 
jude medical s increased sales and marketing efforts  and the launch of the new self tightening suture sts version of the angio seal  which was introduced in the us in march cost of products sold 
cost of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal which gross margin increased to from 
the increase in gross margin reflected the higher margins on our biomaterials products attributable in part to higher volumes which result in manufacturing efficiencies  as well as continued allocation of overhead across greater sales volumes  which results in a decrease in per unit costs 
the cost of the initial quantities of the triactiv were an insignificant portion of cost of products sold for fiscal research and development expense 
research and development expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was mainly attributable to our continued development efforts on the triactiv  including clinical trial expenses 
research and development expenses related to the triactiv increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we also continued to expand our development efforts on our biomaterials products including our work under the nist grants 
biomaterials and other proprietary technologies spending increased million  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million  in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of increased sales and marketing expenses which increased  million to million in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase related primarily to european sales and marketing efforts on the triactiv 
in addition  general and administrative expenses increased  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was attributable to  in increased personnel costs and  in increased professional services and public company expenses  including investor relations and filing fees 
these increases were related to our continued sales and research and development growth 
net interest income 
interest expense decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this was due to a lower principal balance on the thm acquisition obligation as a result of scheduled repayments 
interest income was consistent at million in fiscal and although our cash and investment balances increased  this was offset by lower interest rates 
other non operating income expense 
other non operating expense was  for fiscal compared to other non operating income of  for fiscal other non operating expense income for both periods represented primarily the net gain or loss on the sale of fixed assets 
net income 
net income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was primarily the result of increased sales and royalty income as described above  offset in part by increased expenses associated with research and development and sales and marketing efforts related to the triactiv  also described above 
in addition  the company recognized million in income tax expense in fiscal compared to a income tax benefit in fiscal the prior year income tax benefit was recognized when the valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets was reversed 
based on our projections of taxable income  we believed it was likely we would be able to utilize our federal net operating loss nol carryforwards 
as a result  the valuation allowance related to these carryforwards was no longer considered necessary 
lastly  in fiscal we recognized an in process research and development charge ipr d of million 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by our operating activities was million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  changes in asset and liability balances resulted in a net  use of cash  offset by net income of million and non cash depreciation and amortization of million 
in fiscal  changes in asset and liability balances resulted in a net  use of cash  net income of million  and non cash depreciation and amortization of million 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments were million at june  as of june   we had million in restricted investment accounts 
we had pledged this million in investments as collateral to secure a bank loan to an officer  which was used by the officer for the payment of taxes incurred as the result of the receipt of common stock at the time of our initial public offering in december the company s security pledge related to these loans was released by the bank in february when the officer s loans from the bank were repaid in full 
as such  the restriction on the company s investments was removed 
we spent approximately million  primarily on machinery  equipment and leasehold improvements 
these expenditures were related to the continued expansion of our manufacturing capabilities for our biomaterials and new triactiv product lines 
we have an million capital spending plan for fiscal which will continue to be expended primarily on the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and space for all product lines 
in conjunction with our acquisition of thm in september of  we incurred a note payable to the shareholders of thm in the amount of million the acquisition obligation 
of that amount  million had not been paid as of june  the obligation was due in equal quarterly installments of  which began on december  and was scheduled to end on september  as of february   due to repayments to certain former shareholders of thm  we reduced our remaining quarterly installments to  through september  the cash outflow related to the acquisition obligation will be  in fiscal year and  in fiscal  when the obligation will be fully repaid 
we received million of proceeds and a tax benefit of million from employee stock option exercises during fiscal our operating leases  primarily on our facility in exton  pennsylvania  also represent a significant cash outflow 
lease expense under non cancelable operating leases over the next three years will be as follows  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal we plan to continue to spend substantial amounts to fund clinical trials  to gain regulatory approvals and to continue to expand research and development activities  particularly for the triactiv and our biomaterials products 
we believe our current cash and investment balances in addition to cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least fiscal our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend  however  on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our existing and future products  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in our product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with pre clinical studies  clinical trials and product clearance by the fda and other agencies  the cost and timing of our efforts to expand our manufacturing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of our products 
there can be no assurance that we will record profits in future periods 
see risk factors 
we may need or otherwise decide to seek additional capital in the private and or public equity or debt markets to support a higher level of growth  to respond to competition  to develop more products or for other reasons 
the terms of any future equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders and the terms of any debt financing may contain restrictive covenants which limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
our ability to obtain financing is dependent on the status of our future business prospects as well as conditions prevailing in the relevant capital markets 
no assurance can be given that any additional financing will be made available to us or will be available on acceptable terms should such a need arise 
our estimate of the time periods for which our cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund operations is a forward looking statement within the meaning of private securities litigation reform act of and is subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in such forward looking statements 
in addition to those described above  factors which may cause such a difference are set forth under the caption risk factors in this annual report on form k 
acquisition of thm biomedical  inc 
and in process research and development charge in fiscal  the million ipr d charge represented the estimated fair value of purchased in process technology which has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use and was comprised of the following projects articular cartilage million  bone fusion  other bone applications  and drug delivery million 
each of the four projects utilizes the core open cell poly lactic acid opla technology  a porous tissue matrix ptm technology developed by thm 
ptm technology facilitates wound healing in both bone and soft tissue and is bioabsorbable at controlled rates for specific functions and tissues 
each of the ipr d projects utilizes these properties of the ptm technology to address its respective market 
for example  the articular cartilage project uses the ptm technology as the foundation for an articular cartilage repair and regrowth product 
the total ipr d value was determined by estimating the stage of completion of each ipr d project at the date of the acquisition  estimating the costs to develop each ipr d project into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate in each project takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development and commercialization of the purchased in process technology 
the stage of completion for all projects ranged from to as of the acquisition date with the weighted average completion rate of approximately 
as of that date  the estimated costs to bring the projects under development to technological feasibility and through clinical trials were approximately million 
since the date of the acquisition of thm  as planned  we have primarily devoted our development efforts of the acquired ptm technology to an articular cartilage application  a synthetic vascular graft  and a sustained release chemotherapeutic drug treatment  and have expended approximately   and  on such efforts during fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  we received k approval for a proprietary ptm based product  improvise tm  an absorbable cement flow restrictor for use in certain orthopaedic surgical procedures 
the net cash flows from ipr d projects were based on management s best estimates of revenue  cost of sales  research and development costs  general and administrative costs  and income taxes from such projects 
these estimates were determined considering our historical experience and industry trends and averages 
sales of products incorporating these technologies were forecasted to commence between fiscal and fiscal  depending on the project  with projected revenue growth rates in the range in the immediate years following worldwide market launch  declining to the range as each market nears maturity 
these projections were based on our best estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the cash flows from revenues in each period are reduced by related expenses  capital expenditures  the cost of working capital and an assigned contribution to the core technology serving as a foundation for the research and development 
the discount rates used in discounting the net cash flows from purchased in process technology were for articular cartilage  for bone fusion  for other bone applications and for drug delivery 
these discount rates for each project were determined upon consideration of the stage of completion of the project  the assumptions  nature and timing of the remaining efforts for completion and risks and uncertainties of the project 
substantial further research and development  pre clinical testing and clinical trials will be required to determine the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the products under development 
there can be no assurance such efforts will be successful 
if these projects are not successfully developed  our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods 
we are continuously monitoring our development projects and believe that the assumptions used in the valuation of purchased in process technology reasonably estimate the future benefits attributable to such purchased in process technology 
no assurance can be given that actual results will not deviate from those assumptions in future periods 
research and development tax credit during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a research and development tax credit of million 
the tax credit relates to qualified research and development activities of the company 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks  uncertainties and other factors described below  in addition to the other information set forth in this report  because they could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition  cash flows and prospects as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
risks related to our business we cannot assure you that the clinical trials for the triactiv will be successful or that we will be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the triactiv in the united states 
we need to conduct additional human clinical trials for the triactiv 
it is possible that  during these trials  the triactiv may be found to be ineffective or unsafe or we may encounter other problems that cause us to delay or suspend development of the product 
the triactiv has not been approved for marketing by the fda 
we will require substantial additional expenditures to develop the product  conduct clinical trials and gain the necessary regulatory approval for the triactiv in the us prior to granting approval  the fda may require clarification of information provided in our regulatory submissions  more information or more clinical studies 
if granted  fda approval may impose limitations on the uses for which our product may be marketed or how our product may be marketed 
should we experience delays or be unable to receive approval from the fda  our growth prospects will be diminished 
although we have received ce mark approval and even if we receive fda approval  we may not be successful commercializing the triactiv 
if the triactiv clinical trials are completed successfully and we obtain the necessary governmental approvals  we will need to commercialize the product 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to find a suitable partner and or develop and train our own sales force to sell and market the triactiv 
we recently began to build a sales and marketing force  but had no prior experience hiring or training a sales and marketing force 
we may not be able to expand and maintain an internal sales and marketing force with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities 
if we are unable to successfully commercialize the triactiv  our growth prospects will be diminished 
we derive a substantial majority of our revenues from only two customers 
a substantial majority of our total revenues are derived from only two customers 
royalty income from  and sales of biomaterials to  st 
jude medical associated with the angio seal represented approximately of our total revenue for fiscal while sales of biomaterials products to one other customer  a distributor of orthopaedic products  represented approximately of total revenues 
it is not possible for us to predict the future level of demand for our products that will be generated by these customers or the future demand for the angio seal from customers of st 
jude medical 
our customer concentration exposes us to the risk of changes in the business condition of either our major customers and to the risk that the loss of a major customer would adversely affect our results of operations 
our relationship with these customers is subject to change at any time 
we anticipate that a substantial portion of our revenues will continue to come from the angio seal  which is manufactured  marketed and distributed by st 
jude medical 
under our license agreements with st 
jude medical  the angio seal is manufactured  marketed and sold on a worldwide basis by st 
jude medical 
two of our significant sources of revenue for the future are expected to be sales of collagen to st 
jude medical for use in the angio seal and royalty income from the sale of the angio seal product line 
our success with the angio seal depends in part on the time  effort and attention that st 
jude medical devotes to the angio seal product line and on their success in manufacturing  marketing and selling the angio seal product line 
under the terms of our agreements with st 
jude medical  we have no control over the pricing and marketing strategy for the angio seal product line 
in addition  we depend on st 
jude medical to successfully maintain levels of manufacturing sufficient to meet anticipated demand  abide by applicable manufacturing regulations and seek reimbursement approvals 
st 
jude medical can terminate our arrangement at any time for any reason upon months notice 
at such time  we would receive all sales and marketing  manufacturing and distribution rights to the angio seal product line back 
st 
jude medical may not successfully pass future inspections of its manufacturing facility or adequately perform its manufacturing  marketing and selling duties 
any such failure by st 
jude medical may negatively impact angio seal unit sales and therefore reduce our royalties 
if our biomaterials products are not successful  our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
the success of our existing biomaterials products  as well as any we develop in the future  depends on a variety of factors  including our ability to continue to manufacture  sell and competitively price these products and the acceptance of these products by the medical profession 
in addition  we may be required to obtain regulatory approval for any future biomaterials products 
we will require substantial additional funds to develop and market our biomaterials products 
we expect to fund the growth of our biomaterials business out of our operating income  but this operating income may not be sufficient to develop new biomaterials products 
to date  we have relied on strategic partners or customers to market and sell our biomaterials products 
we cannot assure you that we will commercialize our products successfully either indirectly through strategic partners or directly through the development of a sales force 
we depend on our customers to market and obtain regulatory approvals for their biomaterials products 
we depend on the efforts of our biomaterials customers in marketing their products that include our biomaterials components 
there can be no assurance that our customers end use products that include our biomaterials components will be commercialized successfully by our customers or that our customers will otherwise be able to compete effectively in their markets 
we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some or all of our efforts to develop and market the triactiv if we fail to obtain additional funding that may be required to satisfy our future capital needs 
we plan to continue to spend substantial funds to develop and market the triactiv 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress and success of our clinical trials  the timing and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the timing and cost of developing sales and marketing strategies  our ability to enter into strategic alliances  manufacturing and research and development activities  the extent to which the triactiv gains market acceptance and competitive developments 
any additional required financing may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development activities or sales and marketing efforts  in which case our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and are likely to become more competitive  and our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
the markets for our current and proposed products are fragmented  intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and sensitive to new product introductions and enhancements 
we expect that the competitive environment for our products will become more intense as additional companies enter our markets and as new techniques and technologies are adopted 
our biomaterials and medical devices compete directly and indirectly for customers with a range of products and technologies produced by a wide variety of companies  as well as other processes and procedures which do not require the use of our products or those of our competitors 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories in these markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
our biomaterials products compete with the products of many of the larger companies in the industry 
in the vascular sealing device market  our products compete with products sold by datascope corporation  perclose  inc a subsidiary of abbott laboratories and vascular solutions  inc the majority of vascular sealing is performed through manual compression  which represents our primary competition 
the triactiv is currently only commercially available in europe where our competitors include boston scientific corporation  johnson and johnson  inc  medtronic  inc 
which owns percu surge  inc 
and guidant corporation  among others 
if we are successful in commercializing the triactiv in the us  we anticipate the competitors will be the same companies against which we are competing in europe as well as others 
our competitors may have broad product lines  which allow them to negotiate exclusive  long term supply contracts and offer comprehensive pricing for their products 
broader product lines may also provide our competitors with a significant advantage in marketing competing products to group purchasing organizations and other managed care organizations that are increasingly seeking to reduce costs through centralized purchasing 
greater financial resources and product development capabilities may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete 
because a significant portion of our revenue depends on sales of medical devices by our customers to the end user market  we are also affected by competition within the markets for these devices 
competition within the medical device market could also have an adverse effect on our business for a variety of reasons  including that our customers may compete directly with larger  dominant manufacturers with extensive product lines and greater sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
we are also unable to control other factors that may impact the commercialization of our components for end use products  such as marketing and sales efforts and competitive pricing pressures within particular markets 
if our products are not accepted by the medical community or if our products are replaced by new technologies  our business may suffer 
the success of our existing products depends on continued acceptance of these products by the medical community 
we cannot predict whether or not our products will continue to be accepted and if that acceptance will be sustained to over the long term 
the success of any products we develop in the future will depend on the adoption of these products by our targeted markets 
we cannot predict how quickly  if at all  the medical community will accept our future products or the extent to which our future products will be used 
if we encounter difficulties introducing future products into our targeted markets  our operating results and business may be substantially impaired 
in addition  new technologies and techniques may be developed which may render our current products  along with those under development  obsolete 
the loss of  or interruption of supply from  key vendors could limit our ability to manufacture our products 
we purchase certain materials and components for our products from various suppliers 
some of these components are custom made for us  including many of our absorbable polymer and suture raw materials which are used in our custom polymer products across all markets 
any loss of  or interruption of supply from  key vendors may require us to find new vendors 
we could experience production or development delays while we seek new vendors 
we may have problems manufacturing and delivering our biomaterials products in the future 
the biomaterials industry is an emerging area  using many materials which are untested or whose properties are still not known 
consequently  from time to time we may experience unanticipated difficulties in manufacturing and delivering our biomaterials products to our customers 
these difficulties may include an inability to meet customer demand  delays in delivering products or quality control problems with certain biomaterials products 
our use of hazardous materials exposes us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 
because we use hazardous substances in our research and development and manufacturing operations  we are potentially subject to material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases or exposures at or from our facility 
decontamination costs  other clean up costs and related damages or liabilities could substantially impair our business and operating results 
we are required to comply with increasingly stringent laws and regulations governing environmental protection and workplace safety  including requirements governing the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances 
st 
jude medical s international sales are subject to a number of risks that could harm future international sales of angio seal and their ability to successfully commercialize new products in international markets 
st 
jude medical sells the angio seal product line internationally and pays us a royalty on each unit sold 
we also sell the triactiv  as well as some of our other products  in the international markets 
our royalties from international sales of the angio seal product line by st 
jude medical and our revenues from our other international sales are subject to several risks  including the impact of recessions in economies both within and outside the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers  weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries  fluctuations in exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political and economic instability 
the occurrence of any of these events could seriously harm st 
jude medical s or our future international sales 
our success depends on key personnel  the loss of whom could impair our operating results and business 
our success depends  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of joseph w 
kaufmann  douglas g 
evans  wendy f 
dicicco and other members of senior management 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could harm our operating results and business 
in addition  we will not be successful unless we can attract and retain skilled personnel  particularly in the areas of research and product development 
our failure to expand our management systems and controls to support anticipated growth or integrate future acquisitions could seriously harm our operating results and business 
our operations continue to grow and we expect this expansion to continue as we execute our business strategy 
sustaining our growth has placed significant demands on management and our administrative  operational  information technology  manufacturing  financial and personnel resources 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  client support and financial control systems  and effectively expand  train and manage our employee base 
we may not be able to manage our growth successfully 
any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and harm our operating results 
we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
the process of integrating any acquired business  technology  service or product into our business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of any acquired company also may consume much of our management s time and attention that could otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
furthermore  we may be unable to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary substantially in the future as a result of a number of factors  some of which are not in our control  including market perception and customer acceptance of our products  market perception and acceptance of our customer s products  our efforts to increase sales of our biomaterials products  our efforts to gain fda approval and commercialize the triactiv  our efforts to gain ce mark and fda approval for future generations of the triactiv device  the loss of significant orders  changes in our relationship with st 
jude medical  our establishment of strategic alliances or acquisitions  timely implementation of new and improved products  delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  increased competition  and litigation concerning intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
you should not rely upon our results of operations for any particular quarter as an indication of our results for a full year or any other quarter 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to protect our patents and proprietary rights  our reputation and competitiveness in the marketplace may be materially damaged 
we regard our patents  biomaterials trade secrets and other intellectual property as important to our success 
we rely upon patent law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements and license agreements with st 
jude medical to protect our proprietary rights 
although we have registered certain of our patents with applicable governmental authorities  effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which our products are made available  and we have not sought protection for our intellectual property in every country where our products may be sold 
the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to ensure that third parties will not infringe or otherwise violate our patents or similar proprietary rights 
we and st 
jude medical were plaintiffs in a patent infringement lawsuit against perclose  which was acquired by abbott laboratories  and we were co defendants against counterclaims filed by perclose in response to our complaint 
we spent substantial resources on this litigation and a markman hearing order was entered against us which  was upheld on appeal  and our claims against perclose were denied 
see item legal proceedings 
we may be accused of infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and any related litigation could materially damage our operating results and business 
third parties may claim that we have violated their intellectual property rights 
an adverse determination in any intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings brought against us could prohibit us from selling our products  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
the costs associated with these license arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel 
we do not own or control the use of the angio seal device trademark 
the term angio seal is a trademark of st 
jude medical 
all goodwill generated by the marketing and sales of devices bearing the angio seal trademark belongs to st 
jude medical and not to us 
should the st 
jude medical license agreements terminate  we would not have the right to call any of our products angio seal unless we purchase or license the trademark from st 
jude medical 
without rights to the angio seal trademark  we would have to market our products under a different trademark 
moreover  upon the termination of the st 
jude medical license agreements  st 
jude medical would have the right to compete against us by selling collagen and puncture closure devices under the angio seal trademark 
thus  purchasers of puncture closure devices may be more likely to recognize and purchase products labeled angio seal regardless of whether those devices originate from us 
risks related to our industry we may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities 
the clinical testing  manufacture and sale of medical products involve an inherent risk that human subjects in clinical testing or consumers of the products may suffer serious bodily injury or death due to side effects or other unintended negative reactions to our products 
accordingly  the clinical testing  manufacture and sale of our products entail significant risk of product liability claims 
the medical device industry in general has been subject to significant product liability litigation 
any product liability claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  reduced sales  significant liabilities and diversion of our management s time  attention and resources 
we cannot be sure that our product liability insurance coverage is adequate or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
we face uncertainty relating to third party reimbursement for our products 
we could be seriously harmed by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payers  particularly to the extent any changes affect reimbursement for catheterization procedures in which our angio seal products are used 
if physicians  hospitals and other users of our products may fail to obtain sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payers for procedures in which our products are used or adverse changes may occur in governmental and private third party payers policies toward reimbursement for these procedures 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new and improved products 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental agencies  including the fda and comparable international agencies 
we are required to obtain the approval of the fda and international agencies before we can market and sell new products  satisfy these agencies requirements for all of our labeling  sales and promotional materials in connection with our existing products  comply with all applicable manufacturing regulations  and undergo rigorous inspections by these agencies 
compliance with the regulations of these agencies may delay or prevent us from introducing any new or improved products  including the triactiv 
furthermore  we may be subject to sanctions  including temporary or permanent suspension of operations  product recalls and marketing restrictions if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business 
we are also required to demonstrate compliance with the fda s quality system regulations 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through pre approval and periodic post approval inspections 
these regulations relate to product testing  vendor qualification  design control and quality assurance  as well as the maintenance of records and documentation 
if we are unable to conform to these regulations  we will be required to locate alternative manufacturers that do conform 
identifying and qualifying alternative manufacturers may be a long  costly and difficult process and could seriously harm our business 
the fda and international regulatory agencies may also limit the indications for which our products are approved 
these regulatory agencies may restrict or withdraw approvals we have received if additional information becomes available to support this action 
risks related to our securities the trading price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate substantially in the future 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors  some of which are not in our control  including our ability to meet or exceed our own forecasts or expectations of analysts or investors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements regarding clinical activities or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the medical device industry  changes in our own forecasts or earnings estimates by analysts  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market  which have particularly affected the market prices of many medical device companies  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the market for our stock has experienced  and may continue to experience  price and volume fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance 
as a result  you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price at which you purchase them 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
if any securities litigation is initiated against us  with or without merit  we could incur substantial cost  and our management s attention and resources could be diverted from our business 
future sales of our common stock in the public market by management and other stockholders with significant holdings could cause our stock price to fall 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by management or other significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or adversely affect our future ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities 
our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law may discourage an acquisition of our company 
provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of we have based these forward looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends affecting our business 
in this report  the words believe  may  will  estimate  continue  anticipate  intend  expect  plan and similar expressions  as they relate to kensey nash  our business or our management  are intended to identify forward looking statements  but they are not exclusive means of identifying them 
a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors could cause our actual results  performance  financial condition  cash flows  prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  the forward looking statements 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors include  among other things general economic and business conditions  both nationally and in our markets  the impact of competition  anticipated trends in our business  existing and future regulations affecting our business  strategic alliances and acquisition opportunities  and other risk factors set forth under risk factors above 
except as expressly required by the federal securities laws  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise after the date of this report 
our results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments as well as interest paid on our debt 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of high quality us government  municipal and corporate securities  the majority of which have maturities ranging from years 
also  there are certain municipal variable rate demand obligations that have maturities ranging to years 
these municipal variable rate demand obligations are putable weekly and callable on a monthly basis 
we mitigate default risk by investing in what we believe are safe and high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with secondary or resale markets and we have an audit committee approved investment strategy which currently limits the duration of our investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and decrease in market value if interest rates increase 
at june   our total portfolio consisted of approximately million of investments 
while our investments may be sold at anytime because the portfolio includes available for sale marketable securities with secondary or resale markets  we generally hold securities until the earlier of their call date or their maturity 
therefore  we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
we had million in outstanding debt at june   related to the acquisition of thm
