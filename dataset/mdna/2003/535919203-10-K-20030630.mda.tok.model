see our discussion of sop in critical accounting policies below 
discontinued operation

during fiscal  the company received distributions of million from mandalay under a prior agreement 
on november   the company sold its investment in mandalay for cash of million and an interest bearing convertible promissory note totaling million 
the note  bearing interest at  is payable million on december   million on december  and million on december  no gain or loss was recorded on the sale as the company s carrying value of million equaled the sales price 
investment in cinemanow 
during the quarter ended march   cinemanow advised the company of its inability to generate sufficient cash flows from operation to sustain its operations over the next twelve months  without raising additional capital 
given the uncertain economic climate and cinemanow s recurring losses there was no assurance that further financing would be forthcoming and as a result  the company wrote down its investment in cinemanow to nil 
the write off of the investment in cinemanow of million was disclosed in the statement of operations as the write down in investments subject to significant influence

the round of financing and conversion of a debenture decreased the company s economic and voting interest from to 
the subsequent investment in cinemanow is accounted for using the equity method  as the company does not have the ability to control the strategic  operating  investing and financing decisions of cinemanow as a consequence of the company s inability to elect the majority of the board of directors of cinemanow

critical accounting policies the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
generally accepted accounting principles 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with canadian gaap  which conforms  in all material respects  with us gaap  except as described in the notes to the financial statements 
the us dollar and the canadian dollar are the functional currencies of our us and canadian based businesses  respectively 
commencing with the period beginning april   our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars as a substantial component of our operations are domiciled in the us and the primary market for trading volume of our common shares is on the american stock exchange 
prior to april   our consolidated financial statements were presented in canadian dollars 
these consolidated financial statements and those amounts previously reported in canadian dollars have been translated from canadian dollars to united states dollars by translating the assets and liabilities at the rate in effect at the respective balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses at the average rate for the reporting periods 
any resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the functional currencies of each of the company s operations in the united states and canada are unchanged 
accounting for films and television programs 
in june  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position accounting by producers or distributors of films sop 
sop establishes new accounting standards for producers or distributors of films  including changes in revenue recognition  capitalization and amortization of costs of acquiring films and television programs and accounting for exploitation costs  including advertising and marketing expenses 
we elected early adoption of sop and retroactively adopted sop effective as of april  we also elected to adopt sop for canadian gaap purposes 
the prior years financial statements were not restated  as the effect of the new policy on the prior periods was deemed not reasonably determinable 
accordingly  opening accumulated deficit for the year ended march  was increased to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change in the amount of million net of income taxes of million 
the principal changes as a result of applying sop are as follows advertising and marketing costs  which were previously capitalized to investment in films and television programs on the balance sheet and amortized using the individual film forecast method  are now expensed the first time the advertising takes place 
the capitalization of production costs for episodic television series is limited to revenue that has been contracted for on an episode by episode basis until such time as the criteria for recognizing secondary market revenues are met 
we capitalize costs of production  including financing costs  to investment in motion pictures and television programs 
these costs are amortized to direct operating expenses in accordance with sop these costs are stated at the lower of unamortized motion picture or television program costs or fair value net present value 
these costs for an individual motion picture or television program are amortized in the proportion that current period actual revenues bear to management s estimates of the total revenue expected to be received from such motion picture or television program over a period not to exceed ten years from the date of delivery 
management regularly reviews and revises when necessary  its total revenue estimates  which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and or write down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the motion picture or television program to its fair value 
no assurance can be given that unfavorable changes to revenue estimates will not occur  which may result in significant write downs affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale or licensing of motion pictures and television programs is recognized upon meeting all recognition requirements of sop revenue from the theatrical release of motion pictures is recognized at the time of exhibition based on the company s participation in box office receipts 
revenue from the sale of dvds in the retail market  net of an allowance for estimated returns  is recognized on the later of shipment to the customer or street date when it is available for sale by the customer 
under revenue sharing arrangements  rental revenue is recognized when we are entitled to receipts and such receipts are determinable 
revenues from television licensing are recognized when the motion picture or television program is available to the licensee for telecast 
for television licenses that include separate availability windows during the license period  revenue is allocated over the windows 
revenue from sales of international territories are recognized when the feature film or television program is available to the distributor for exploitation and no conditions for delivery exist  which under most sales contracts requires that full payment has been received from the distributor 
for contracts that provide for rights to exploit a program on multiple media eg theatrical  video  television with a fee for a single motion picture or television program where the contract specifies the permissible timing of release to various media  the fee is allocated to the various media based on management s assessment of the relative fair value of the rights to exploit each media and is recognized as the program is released to each media 
for multiple title contracts with a fee  the fee is allocated on a title by title basis  based on management s assessment of the relative fair value of each title 
rental revenue from short term operating leases of studio facilities is recognized over the term of the lease 
prior to december  we earned fees from management services provided to canadian limited partnerships  whose purpose was to assist in the financing of motion pictures produced in canada  and those fees were recognized as revenue when the financing was completed 
we no longer provide these management services due to the rescission of certain tax shelter provisions by the canadian government 
cash payments received are recorded as deferred revenue until all the conditions of revenue recognition have been met 
we accrue for video returns and provide for allowances in the financial statements based on previous returns and our allowances history on a title by title basis in each of the video businesses 
there may be differences between actual returns and allowances and our historical experience 
income taxes 
the company recognizes future income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the financial statements or income tax returns 
future income taxes are provided for using the liability method 
under the liability method  future income taxes are recognized for all significant temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities 
goodwill 
in november  the cica released handbook section  goodwill and other intangible assets  to be applied by companies for fiscal years beginning on or after january  early adoption of cica was permitted for companies with their fiscal year beginning on or after april   provided the first interim period financial statements had not been previously issued 
we elected to early adopt cica on april  under cica  goodwill is no longer amortized but is reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  unless certain criteria have been met 
cica is similar  in many respects  to sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  under us gaap 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
notes c and to our consolidated financial statements include additional information relating to the net carrying value of goodwill and the pro forma effect of the adoption of cica on the prior years consolidated statements of operations

presentation of ebitda is consistent with our past practice  and ebitda is a non gaap financial measure commonly used in the entertainment industry and by financial analysts and others who follow the industry to measure operating performance

anticipated cash requirements 
the nature of our business is such that significant initial expenditures are required to produce and acquire motion pictures and television programs  while revenues from these motion pictures and television programs are earned over an extended period of time after their completion or acquisition 
as our operations grow  our financing requirements are expected to grow and management projects the continued use of cash in operating activities and therefore we are dependent on continued access to external sources of financing 
we believe that cash flow from operations  cash on hand  credit lines available and tax shelter financing available will be adequate to meet known operational cash requirements for the foreseeable future  including the funding of future motion picture and television production  motion picture rights acquisitions  and theatrical and video release schedules 
we monitor our cash flow  interest coverage  liquidity  capital base and debt to total capital ratios with the long term goal of maintaining our creditworthiness 
our current financing strategy is to finance corporate operations and to leverage investment in motion picture and television programs through equity  operating credit facilities and single purpose production financing 
we usually obtain financing commitments  including  in some cases  funds from government incentive programs and foreign distribution commitments 
these commitments have averaged at least of the budgeted third party costs of a project before commencing production

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency and interest rate risk management market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from the financial debt instruments that arise from transactions entered into during the normal course of business 
as part of our overall risk management program  we evaluate and manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and currency exchange risks on an ongoing basis 
hedges and derivative financial instruments will be used in the future  within guidelines approved or to be approved by the board of directors for counterpart exposure  limits and hedging practices  in order to manage our interest rate and currency exposure 
we have no intention of entering into financial derivative contracts  other than to hedge a specific financial risk 
currency rate risk 
we incur certain operating and production costs in foreign currencies and are subject to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our principal currency exposure is between canadian and us dollars  although this exposure has been significantly mitigated through the structuring of the million revolving credit facility as a million canadian dollar facility and a million us dollar credit facility 
each facility is borrowed and repaid in the respective country of origin  in local currency 
we also enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge future production expenses denominated in canadian dollars 
gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts are capitalized and recorded as production costs when the gains and losses are realized 
as at march   there were no foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
during the fiscal year  we completed foreign exchange contracts denominated in canadian dollars 
the net gains resulting from the completed contracts amounted to million 
these contracts are entered into with a major financial institution as counterpart 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterpart  which is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts  at current market rates 
there are no unrecognized gains or losses at march  these forward exchange contracts do not subject us to risk from exchange rate movements because gains and losses on the contracts offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged 
no collateral or other security was pledged as security to support these financial instruments 
we currently intend to continue to enter into such contracts to hedge against future material foreign currency exchange rate risks 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in market interest rates related to our outstanding debt 
for example  our credit facilities and some of our long term debt bears interest on borrowings outstanding at various time intervals and at market rates based on either the canadian prime rate or the us prime rate  plus a margin ranging from to 
our principal risk with respect to our long term debt is interest rate risk  to the extent not mitigated by interest rate swap and foreign exchange contracts
