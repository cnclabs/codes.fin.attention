the company did not purchase deep enough quantities in certain key classifications of merchandise  and sales in the best selling items were not maximized 
comparable store sales declined during the fourth quarter in the full price retail stores as compared to a decline of for the fourth quarter of prior year for the full price retail stores 
this was combined with significant sales declines in the ou tlet division 
comparable store sales in outlets declined during the company determined that it had too many outlet stores and is closing four of the seven outlet stores in the first half of since the company purchased very little merchandise in directly for the outlet division  the outlet store inventories throughout the year were down significantly over the prior year 
additionally  the outlets were used to liquidate older inventory  resulting in more units being sold but at lower prices 
another variable to the total company sales declines was the reduction to warehouse sales conducted  as the company s available inventory levels declined 
warehouse sale volume declined by million  or  in as compared to the prior year 
total company sales decreased in as compared to a decrease of in and an increase of in no new locations were opened during compared to the opening of two new locations during the company believes the sales decrease in was primarily because the ladies merchandise assortment for the first half of the year was not meeting the needs of the company s target customer of age  but instead was targeting a younger audience in terms of styling and fit 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reported a significant improvement in sales trends as customer response to the holiday and preview merchandise assortments continued to improve 
comparable store sales declined during the fourth quarter in the full price retail stores as compared to a decline of for the full year of and decreased total company for the quarter 
like many other retailers  the company s sales were significantly impacted by the tragic events of septe mber  during  comparable store sales declined in total for the year

in early  the company ceased conducting business through the catalog and internet  resulting in a decrease in sales of million for the year as compared to comparable store sales declined during  compared to a decline of in the company believes that the declines experienced in comparable store sales during were primarily attributable to the reasons mentioned above for total sales 
the declines experienced in comparable store sales during were primarily attributable to disappointing sales in ladies merchandise assortments 
the company s gross margin increased to in from in  or of sales 
the increase in the company s gross margin was primarily due to an increase in the gross margin in the full price retail stores due to improved content and reduced purchase levels 
the company s gross margin decreased to in from in  or of sales 
higher occupancy costs that did not leverage due to lower sales represented of the total decrease 
additional declines are primarily attributed to additional markdowns on slow selling merchandise inventory incurred due to sales shortfalls  aggressive efforts to liquidate prior season inventory and continued editing of assortments in an effort to improve inventory turnover 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by of sales in compared to an increase of of sales in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in was primarily due to the sales declines experienced for the year and the lack of leverage of fixed payroll costs

the company recorded approximately  in restructuring charges 
the restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter consisted of severance costs of approximately  associated with elimination of positions in the corporate office  with the remainder of restructuring charges attributable to the acceleration of amortization of assets in conjunction with planned store closings in the first half of during the third quarter of  after a review of the goodwill balance originating from the purchase of cmt enterprises  inc in february  and the material changes that had occurred in the operation  it was determined that a write off of the entire goodwill balance was deemed appropriate 
the net amount of goodwill written off was approximately million which represented of sales for the year during  the total interest costs decreased  from due to lower outstanding debt balances 
lower average interest rates were also a contributing factor 
the average balance on total outstanding debt was  in  compared to  in the decrease in average debt balances resulted principally from the sale of preferred stock in the amount of  and the application of the proceeds of such sale to reduce debt 
increases to interest expense may occur if the company s cash flow requires additional borrowed funds 
during  interest costs including capitalized interest decreased  as compared to resulting principally from the sale of preferred stock in the amount of  and the application of the proceeds of such sale to reduce debt 
the company s effective income tax rate was in  in and in the company did not elect to record the full tax benefit for all or losses in the financial statements 
during  the company increased its valuation allowance to fully provide for all remaining deferred tax assets because the company s recent history of operating losses makes the realization of these assets uncertain 
it is expected that such amounts could be utilized for tax purposes against any future operating income 
capital expenditures  capital resources and liquidity cash flows from operating activities 
for  net cash used in operating activities was  as compared to  net cash provided by operating activities for the decrease in cash flows can be primarily attributed to the increase in the company s net loss from prior year

the company has no off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated  limited purpose entities  nor does it have any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities 
liquidity the company considers the following as measures of liquidity and capital resources as of the dates indicated dollars in thousands 
working capital s current ratio ratio of working capital to total assets ratio of long term debt including current maturities to stockholders equity preferred stock is treated as equity for this calculation 
the company s primary needs for liquidity are to finance its inventories and revolving charge accounts and to invest in existing store remodeling  fixtures and equipment as well as new stores 
cash flow from operations and proceeds from credit facilities represent the company s sources of liquidity 
management anticipates these sources of liquidity  combined with the receipt of million of a preferred stock proceeds in february see note to be sufficient in the foreseeable future 
the company s capital expenditures budget for is approximately  to be used for the purchase of fixtures and equipment as well as store remodeling expenses 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for information about restrictions and covenants under the company s revolving line of credit 
seasonality the company s business is subject to seasonal influences  with the major portion of sales realized during the fall season third and fourth quarters of each year  which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons 
in light of this pattern  selling  general and administrative expenses are typically higher as a percentage of sales during the spring seasons first and second quarters of each year 
inflation inflation affects the costs incurred by the company in its purchase of merchandise and in certain components of its selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company attempts to offset the effects of inflation through price increases and control of expenses  although the company s ability to increase prices is limited by competitive factors in its markets 
inflation has had no meaningful effect on sales or net earnings of the company 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  the company believes it has taken conservative positions  where assumptions and estimates are used  in order to minimize the negative financial impact to the company that could result if actual results vary from the assumptions and estimates 
in management s opinion  the areas of the company where the most significant judgment is exercised is in th e allowance for doubtful accounts related to the company s proprietary credit card program  the valuation of inventory  impairment estimates and revenue recognition 
the selection  application and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
in  approximately of the company s net retail sales were made under its proprietary credit card program  which resulted in customer accounts receivable balances of approximately  at february  the company has significant experience in managing its credit card program 
each month  the company reviews all of its credit card accounts and writes off those deemed uncollectible 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained and periodically reviewed 
the allowance is primarily based on account write off trends and aging information 
the company does not expect actual results to vary significantly from our estimate 
the company uses the retail inventory method 
under this method  the company records markdowns to value merchandise inventories at net realizable value 
the company closely monitors actual and forecasted sales trends  current inventory levels  and aging information by merchandise categories 
if forecasted sales are not achieved  additional markdowns may be needed in future periods to clear excess or slow moving merchandise  which may result in lower gross margins 
when a store experiences unfavorable operating performance  the company evaluates whether an impairment charge should be recorded 
a store s assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing the store s estimated undiscounted cash flows to the assets carrying value 
if the cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  the assets are written down to fair value 
impairment losses associated with these reviews have not been significant 
however  if comparative store sales decline and general negative economic trends continue  future impairment losses could be significant 
sales from store locations represented of the company s total sales for these sales are recognized at the time of the customer s purchase 
sales are net of returns and exclude sales tax 
catalog and website sales no longer represent any of the company s sales as these selling methods were eliminated in the first quarter of catalog and website sales were of sales during these sales were recognized at the time the order was shipped to the customer 
gift card sales are recognized as revenue when the gift card is redeemed  not when it is sold

forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements may be preceded or followed by or otherwise include the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  estimates  will  would  could or similar expressions 
such forward looking statements  which reflect the company s current views of future events and financial performance  involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from planned or expected results 
those risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the impact of competition  pricing pressure  product demand and market acceptance risks  mergers and acquisitions  reliance on key strategic alliances  the ability to attract and retain key employees  the availability of cash for growth  fluctuations in operating res ults  ability to continue funding operating losses  and the ability of new management to improve the company s financial condition and performance 
for all of these reasons  actual results may vary materially from the forward looking statements 
the company assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
commitments the following table reflects certain of the company s commitments as of february  payments due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt store leases operating leases other than stores total store leases are based on minimum rents exclusive of percentage rent based on sales which could increase rental expense 
the foregoing table does not include contractual commitments pursuant to executory contracts for products and services such as telephone  data  computer maintenance and other regular payments pursuant to contracts that are expected to remain in existence for several years but as to which the company s obligations are contingent upon the company s continued receipt of the contracted products and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for the company refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and various foreign currencies 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how the company views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate at february   the company had long term debt outstanding of approximately million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 
the remaining million bears interest at variable rates  which averaged approximately during a increase in short term interest rates on the variable rate debt outstanding at february  would approximate basis points 
such an increase in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  assuming borrowed amounts remain outstanding 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in sales volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that management would take in response to such a change is also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
the table below provides information about the company s debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates expected maturity in thousands thereafter total long term debt variable rate weighted average interest rate fixed rate weighted average interest rate foreign currency substantially all of the company s purchases are priced in us dollars 
however  some european purchases are denominated in local currency and  therefore  are subject to the fluctuation in currency exchange rates 
from time to time the company utilizes forward exchange contracts to secure firm pricing related to purchase commitments to be denominated in foreign currencies 
the contracts are of varying short term durations and amounts include a window delivery feature  which provides the company with an option to enter into a swap agreement in the event that all of the currency is not utilized at the end of the contract s delivery term 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the principal currency hedged is the italian lira 
the company regularly monitors its foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
the company had no foreign exchange instruments outstanding at february   therefore  a sensitivity analysis would result in no impact to earnings 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies would be excluded from the sensitivity analysis 
additionally  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on the company during  or
