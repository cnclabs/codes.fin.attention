item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general since the late s  we have derived virtually all of our revenue from the sale of suspension assemblies to a small number of customers 
we currently supply a variety of suspension assemblies and suspension assembly components based on several standard designs to manufacturers of disk drives and manufacturers of disk drive components including alps  fujitsu  hitachi global storage technologies formerly ibm s hard disk drive division and its affiliates  innovex  kaifa  kr precision  maxtor  pemstar  sae magnetics tdk  samsung  seagate technology  toshiba and western digital 
suspension assemblies are a critical component of disk drives and our results of operations are highly dependent on the disk drive industry 
the disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and demand for disk drive components fluctuates 
our results of operations are affected from time to time due to disk drive industry demand changes  technological changes that impact suspension assembly demand  shifts in our market share and our customers market share  our customers production yields and our own product transitions 
from to  improvements in data density  the amount of data which can be stored on magnetic disks  outpaced disk drive storage capacity requirements 
this enabled disk drive manufacturers to reduce their costs by using fewer components  including suspension assemblies  in each drive 
we estimate that the average number of suspension assemblies required per drive decreased from approximately in to approximately in  approximately in and approximately in shifts in our position in the marketplace had also  to a lesser extent  decreased demand for our products 
slower growth of disk drive storage demand and a weaker global economy had also decreased demand for our products since consequently  our shipments declined from million in to million in our shipments of suspension assemblies in were million  higher than our shipments in this increase was due to an increase in disk drive demand  an increase in suspension consumption related to lower yields some of our customers continue to experience as they transition to higher density recording heads and improvements in our market position 
during the transition to higher density recording heads  some customers have experienced higher levels of defective recording heads  which they are unable to detect until after they have attached the recording heads to our suspension assemblies 
in addition  with a slowing rate of improvement in data density  we estimate that the average number of suspension assemblies required per drive was approximately in  down from in although we continue to have limited visibility for future demand  we expect our shipment volumes for the first quarter of to exceed the quarterly levels experienced in primarily due to continued increases in disk drive demand and this lower rate of improvement in data density 
our selling prices are subject to market pressure from our competitors and pricing pressure from our customers 
our selling prices also are affected by changes in overall demand for our products  changes in the specific products our customers buy and a product s life cycle 
a typical life cycle for our products begins with higher pricing when products are introduced and decreasing prices as they mature 
to offset price decreases during a product s life  we rely primarily on higher sales volume and improving our manufacturing yield and efficiency to reduce its cost 
if we cannot reduce our manufacturing costs as prices decline during our products life cycles  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we typically allow customers to change or cancel orders on short notice 
we plan our production and inventory based primarily on forecasts of customer demand  including forecasts of customer pulls of product out of our vendor managed inventory vmi facilities 
customers often prefer a dual source supply and  therefore  may allocate their demand among suppliers 
both customer demand and the resulting forecasts often fluctuate substantially 
these factors  among others  create an environment where scheduled production and capacity utilization can vary significantly from week to week  leading to variability in gross margins and difficulty in estimating our position in the marketplace 
our gross margins have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate based upon a variety of factors such as changes in demand or customer requirements  product mix  selling prices  utilization of our production capacity  infrastructure costs  production and engineering costs associated with production of new products  manufacturing yields or efficiencies  and costs of materials 
gross margins improved in primarily due to increased suspension assembly demand  increased utilization of our manufacturing capacity  improved productivity and continued cost controls 
in and  as a result of industry forecasts of slower growth for disk drive storage demand and a significant decrease in our long term forecast for suspension demand  we recorded asset impairment charges totaling  and  respectively 
as a result of these charges we estimated annual savings in depreciation and lease costs of approximately   and  in our fiscal years  and  respectively  and thereafter an aggregate of  in additional savings 
since actual demand and our long term forecast for demand for suspension assemblies has improved due to an increase in disk drive demand  an increase in suspension consumption related to lower yields some of our customers continue to experience as they transition to higher density recording heads  improvements in our market position and a slowdown in the rate of improvement in data density on disk drives in mass production 
consequently  the majority of the previously impaired assets were placed back in service during as a result  operating results and gross margins have and will continue to be impacted favorably by lower depreciation and lease expenses as a result of these previous charges 
the disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and our customers operating results are dependent on being the first to market and first to volume with new products at a low cost 
our ability to respond to our customers needs for new products and product features on a timely basis is an important factor in our success 
our dedicated development center enables us to shorten development cycles and achieve high volume output per manufacturing unit more quickly 
new suspension assembly types have lower manufacturing yields and are produced in smaller quantities than more mature products 
manufacturing yields generally improve as the product matures and production volumes increase 
manufacturing yields also vary depending on the complexity and uniqueness of product specifications 
small variations in manufacturing yields generally have a significant impact on gross margins 
because our business is capital intensive and requires a high level of fixed costs  gross margins are also sensitive to changes in volume and capacity utilization 
in addition to increases in suspension assembly demand  improvements to our operating margins depend  in part  on the successful management of our corporate infrastructure and our suspension assembly production capacity 
as part of our efforts to improve our operating margins through reduced costs and improved efficiency  we reduced our overall employment level  through workforce reductions and managed attrition  from  at the end of to  at the end of our overall employment level has increased to  at the end of  and we have an additional production workers supplied by temporary staffing agencies working at our various facilities  due to increased demand 
market trends we expect that the expanding use of enterprise computing and storage  personal computers  increasingly complex software and the emergence of new applications for disk storage  such as personal video recorders  gaming consoles  digital cameras  audio players  guidance systems in automobiles and cell phones and other consumer applications  will increase disk drive demand and  therefore  suspension assembly demand in the future 
we also believe demand for disk drives will continue to be subject  as it has in the past  to rapid or unforeseen changes resulting from  among other things  changes in disk drive inventory levels  technological advances  responses to competitive price changes and unpredicted high or low market acceptance of new drive models 
improvements in data density of disk drives  across all disk drive market segments  have reduced unit shipments of suspension assemblies since the third quarter of however  data density has improved at a slower rate in the past year  and we believe it will continue to improve at a slower rate in the upcoming year 
worldwide suspension assembly shipments increased in due to overall growth in disk drives shipped  increased consumption of suspension assemblies resulting from lower yields some customers are experiencing because of the continuing challenges posed by the use of higher density recording heads  and an increase in our market share 
we believe that worldwide suspension assembly shipments are likely to track more closely with the growth in industry wide disk drive shipments  which is currently forecasted by industry observers to be for we continue to have limited visibility for future demand 
as in past years  disk drives continue to be the storage device of choice for applications requiring low access times and higher capacities because of their speed and low cost per gigabyte of stored data 
the cost of storing data on disk drives continues to decrease primarily due to increasing data density  thereby increasing storage capacity in disk drives or reducing the number of components  including suspension assemblies  required in a disk drive 
the continual pursuit of increasing data density and lower storage costs are leading to further adoption of features for suspensions  such as dampers  extended arms  polished headlifts  limiters  anti static coatings and plated grounds 
our suspension assemblies also allow for dual stage actuation  which incorporates a second stage actuator on the suspension to improve head positioning over increasingly tighter data tracks 
the introduction of new types or sizes of read write heads and disk drives tends to initially decrease customers yields with the result that we may experience temporary elevations of demand for some types of suspension assemblies 
we believe reduced yields at some of our customers due to their transition to higher density recording heads has resulted in increased shipments of our suspension assemblies in and may continue to have a positive impact on demand in as programs mature  higher customer yields decrease the demand for suspension assemblies 
the advent of new heads and new drive designs may require rapid development and implementation of new suspension assembly types which temporarily may reduce our manufacturing yields and efficiencies 
these changes will continue to affect us 
operations to operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales from period to period 
percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses litigation settlement asset impairment and restructuring charges income loss from operations interest and other income  net loss on debt extinguishment interest expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net sales for were  an increase of  or compared to suspension assembly sales increased  or compared to  primarily as a result of a increase in unit shipments 
additionally  sales of suspension assembly components to other suspension assembly manufacturers increased  or compared to both of these increases were due to an increase in disk drive shipments  an increase in the consumption of suspension assemblies resulting from lower yields some of our customers are experiencing because of the continuing challenges posed by the use of higher density recording heads and an increase in our market share 
the increase in suspension assembly volume was partially offset by a decline in average selling prices for our suspension assemblies 
gross profit for was  compared to  for the increase was primarily due to the increase in net sales discussed above 
gross profit as a percent of net sales increased from to  primarily due to higher demand for suspension assemblies  increased utilization of our manufacturing capacity  improved productivity and continued cost controls 
research and development expenses for were  compared to  for this decrease was primarily due to a  increase in customer funding of certain advanced suspension assembly development costs 
research and development expenses as a percent of net sales decreased from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses for were  an increase of  or from the increase was due primarily to a  increase in incentive compensation costs resulting from improved profitability compared to selling  general and administrative expenses also increased by  due to increases in our sales  marketing and regulatory efforts for our biomeasurement division  and by  related to the design of our new erp business system 
expenses for on site service and engineering support to our customers in asia increased by  these overall increases were partially offset by a  reduction in legal fees  primarily due to reduced patent litigation defense costs and a  reduction in bad debt expense  as we collected certain customer accounts that were previously deemed uncollectible 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased from in to in during the first quarter of  we recorded an increase to operating income of  as a result of a reimbursement of legal expenses from another party and insurance proceeds related to litigation defense costs 
see note  litigation settlement  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income from operations for was  compared to  for the increase was primarily due to the increase in net sales discussed above  increased utilization of our manufacturing capacity  improved productivity and continued cost controls 
income from operations for included a  loss from operations for our biomeasurement division segment  compared to a  loss for interest expense for was  a decrease of  from  primarily due to a lower average amount of outstanding debt  a lower interest rate resulting from refinancing our convertible subordinated notes due the convertible notes and fewer capitalized leases 
interest income for was  a decrease of  from this was primarily a result of lower investment yields  offset partially by a higher average investment balance 
during the first and second quarters of  we retired  of our convertible notes before their maturity 
in connection with these transactions  we recorded a  pre tax loss on debt extinguishment in during the fourth quarter of  we extinguished  of senior unsecured notes and  of our convertible notes before their maturity 
in connection with these transactions  we recorded a  pre tax loss on debt extinguishment in see note  financing arrangements  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other income  net of other expenses  for was  an increase of  from  primarily due to increased royalty income and increased rental income from leasing portions of our facilities that we do not intend to utilize for the foreseeable future 
the income tax provision for was based on an estimated effective tax rate for the fiscal year of  which is below the statutory federal rate primarily due to our estimate of the benefit derived from the foreign sales corporation fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of eti provisions related to export of us products and our estimate of our utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
the increase in our effective tax rate  from in to in  is primarily due to a reduction in the estimated benefit that we may derive from the eti provisions in proportion to the growth in our pre tax income 
net income for was  or of net sales  compared to net income of  or of net sales for our improved profitability was primarily due to the increase in net sales  increased utilization of our manufacturing capacity  improved productivity and continued cost controls noted above 
net income for included the above mentioned loss on debt extinguishment 
net income for included the increase in operating income from a reimbursement of legal expenses and insurance proceeds related to litigation defense costs  and the loss on debt extinguishment  noted above 
operations to operations net sales for were  a decrease of  or compared to suspension assembly sales decreased  compared to  primarily due to a decrease in suspension assembly sales volume and declining average selling prices for suspension assemblies 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in suspension assembly component sales 
gross profit for was  compared to  for  and gross profit as a percent of net sales increased from to 
this increase was primarily due to the cost reduction efforts completed during and productivity improvements in labor and benefits expenses were reduced by  as a result of workforce reductions and productivity improvements  and depreciation decreased  as a result of the asset impairment charges recorded in and lower capital expenditures in and inventory scrap costs were also reduced by  in these improvements were partially offset by the lower suspension assembly sales volume and lower average selling prices noted above 
research and development expenses for were  compared to  for the decrease was primarily due to customer funding of a portion of our advanced suspension assembly development costs and reduced product development costs in our biomeasurement division 
suspension assembly product and process development accounted for  of such expenses  and the remaining  was used for ongoing product development and clinical research related to the medical device developed by our biomeasurement division 
as a percent of net sales  research and development expenses decreased from in to in selling  general and administrative expenses for were  an increase of  or compared to the increase was due primarily to a  increase in incentive compensation costs  and to a lesser extent  higher bad debt expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a  reduction in legal and professional fees and a  reduction in labor and benefits expenses and  to a lesser extent  lower depreciation and lease expenses  reduced recruitment and relocation expenses  and lower travel and training costs 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in during the first quarter of  we recorded an increase to operating income of  as a result of a reimbursement of legal expenses from a third party and insurance proceeds related to litigation defense costs 
see note  litigation settlement  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other income  net  for was  a decrease of  compared to other income  net  primarily consisted of interest income  royalty income and rental income 
interest income decreased from  in to  in as a result of lower investment yields 
during the fourth quarter of  we extinguished  of senior unsecured notes and  of convertible subordinated notes before their maturity 
in connection with these transactions  we recorded a  pre tax loss on debt extinguishment 
see note  financing arrangements  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense for was  a decrease of  compared to  primarily due to carrying a lower amount of outstanding debt and fewer capitalized leases 
the income tax provision for was based on an estimated effective tax rate for the fiscal year of  which is below the statutory federal rate primarily due to the benefit derived from the eti provisions related to export of us products 
net income for was  compared to a net loss of  for our improved profitability was primarily due to cost reduction efforts completed during and productivity improvements in net income for included the above mentioned increase to operating income and loss on debt extinguishment 
the net loss included charges of  for asset write downs and severance costs 
excluding these items  net income loss as a percent of net sales  increased from in to in liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  securities available for sale  cash flow from operations and additional financing capacity 
our cash and cash equivalents increased from  at september  to  at september  our securities available for sale increased from  to  during the same period 
overall  this reflects an  increase in our cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale  primarily due to improved profitability in and the net proceeds from the sale of our convertible subordinated notes due the convertible notes and the redemption of our convertible notes mentioned below 
we generated cash from operating activities of  in as of september   our  credit facility had a borrowing base of  secured by our eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
letters of credit outstanding under this facility totaled  and fees due totaled  as of such date 
the amount we can borrow under this credit facility is limited by the levels of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances 
as of september    of borrowing capacity remained available to us 
cash used for capital expenditures totaled  for compared to  in and  in the capital expenditures during were primarily for increases in tsa suspension production capacity  new program tooling  process technology and capability improvements and new business systems 
we anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately  in primarily for tsa suspension production capacity  process technology and capability improvements  new program tooling and new business systems 
financing of these capital expenditures will be principally from internally generated funds  cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
during the first quarter of  we repurchased  of our convertible notes at a pre tax gain of  on march   we redeemed the remaining  of our convertible notes at a pre tax loss of  the pre tax loss consisted of a  redemption premium and a  write off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the convertible notes 
these notes had a maturity date of march  prior to the redemption of our convertible notes  in february  we issued and sold  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes to salomon smith barney inc and needham company  inc  which resold the convertible notes to qualified institutional buyers  and outside the united states in accordance with regulation s under the securities act of  as amended 
we used net proceeds of  from the issuance and sale of the convertible notes primarily to redeem our convertible notes  with the remaining proceeds intended to be used for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the issuance and sale of the convertible notes  we incurred and capitalized debt issuance costs of  which will be amortized over the term of the convertible notes 
beginning in the third quarter of  the redemption of the convertible notes  combined with the issuance and sale of the convertible notes  has reduced our interest expense by  per quarter 
certain of our existing financing agreements contain financial covenants as well as covenants which  among other things  restrict our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and restrict our ability to enter into certain types of financing 
as of september   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
if  however  we are not in compliance with the covenants in our financing agreements at the end of any future quarter and cannot obtain amendments on terms acceptable to us  our future financial results and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents  securities available for sale  cash generated from operations and our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  debt service requirements and capital expenditures through our ability to obtain additional financing  if needed  will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results and general economic and capital market conditions 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all  if needed 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
revenue recognition in recognizing revenue in any period  we apply the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs associated with products sold are classified as revenue 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
certain of our products are delivered on an fob destination basis 
we defer our revenue associated with these transactions until the delivery has occurred to the customers premises 
we also store inventory in warehouses vendor managed inventory vmi facilities that are located close to the customer s manufacturing facilities 
revenue is recognized on sales from vmi facilities upon the transfer of title and risk of loss  following the customer s acknowledgement of the receipt of the goods 
we also enter into arrangements with customers that provide us with reimbursement for guaranteed capacity 
we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated life of the program for which the capacity is guaranteed 
accounts receivable we are dependent on a limited number of customers  and as a result  our trade accounts receivable is highly concentrated 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectability based on past transaction history with the customer and the customer s financial condition 
while we perform ongoing credit reviews of our customers and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts  a significant deterioration in the financial condition of any significant customer may result in additional charges to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts or to write off certain accounts 
we record a provision against revenue for estimated sales returns on sales of our products in the same period that the related revenues are recognized 
we base the allowance on historical returns as well as existing product return authorizations 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market by analyzing market conditions  current sales prices  inventory costs  and inventory balances 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers and a limited number of product programs for each customer 
because our products are custom built  we typically cannot shift work in process or finished goods from customer to customer  or from one program to another for a particular customer 
we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog  estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to the lower of cost or market based on the analysis 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value would generally be determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or a benefit within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of  as of september   due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of certain tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our historical taxable income and our estimates of future taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
management will continue to assess the likelihood that the deferred tax asset will be realizable and the valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly 
to the extent that operating results continue to be favorable in and management anticipates favorable operating results beyond  the valuation allowance may be materially reduced 
such adjustment may significantly reduce our reported income tax provision in the period of adjustment  and may increase our reported income tax provision in subsequent periods 
management continually evaluates this information and in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
other matters we are involved in certain legal matters which may result in additional future cash requirements 
see the discussion of these matters in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we are subject to certain recent accounting pronouncements 
see the discussion of these matters in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
over the course of the last three years  the world trade organization wto has ruled that the fsc provisions of the united states internal revenue code irc  and the replacement provisions contained in the eti  are prohibited export subsidies under the rules of the wto 
federal legislation introduced in both calendar and has proposed the repeal of eti 
until such legislation is signed into law  we expect to earn a net benefit under the eti provisions similar to that previously earned under the fsc provisions of the irc 
if such legislation is signed into law  our effective tax rate could increase significantly and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our financial condition 
we cannot be sure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
forward looking statements the statements under the headings business industry background  products  competition and risk factors about demand for and shipments of disk drives  suspension assemblies  including tsa suspensions  and suspension assembly components and disk drive and tsa suspension technology and development  the statements under the headings management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general and market trends about demand for and shipments of disk drives and suspension assemblies  including tsa suspensions  the statements under the heading business risk factors and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general about our future operating results and the statements under the heading business research and development and risk factors and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources about capital expenditures  including research and development spending  and capital resources  are forward looking statements based on current expectations

these factors may cause our actual future results to differ materially from historical earnings and from the financial performance we presently anticipate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our credit facility with the cit group business credit  inc carries interest rate risk  in connection with certain borrowings under the working capital line it provides  that is generally related to either libor or the prime rate 
if either of these rates were to change while we had such borrowings outstanding under the working capital line provided by the credit facility  interest expense would increase or decrease accordingly 
at september   there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risk on our other debt obligations which are subject to fixed interest rates 
interest rate changes  however  would affect the fair market value of this fixed rate debt 
at september   we had fixed rate debt of  we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments or hedging transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
all of our sales transactions are denominated in united states dollars and thus are not subject to risk due to currency exchange fluctuations 
certain sales transactions in our biomeasurement division may be denominated in foreign currencies
