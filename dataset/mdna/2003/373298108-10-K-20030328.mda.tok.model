the corporation has the intent to renew the letters of credit supporting these revenue bonds 
therefore  maturities of these obligations are reflected in accordance with their stated terms 
the corporation s debt portfolio is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of the corporation s debt portfolio due to differences in market interest rates and the rates at inception of the debt agreements 
based on the corporation s indebtedness at december   a basis point interest rate change is estimated to impact the fair value of the debt portfolio by million and interest expense by million 
the corporation also has international subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the us dollar reporting currency 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates will result in cumulative currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive income 
based on the corporation s investment in operations located in europe at december   a percent change in foreign currency exchange rates for the related currencies is estimated to impact other comprehensive income by approximately million

at december   the corporation had interest rate exchange agreements that effectively converted million of floating rate obligations with a weighted average interest rate of to fixed rate obligations with an average effective interest rate of approximately 
interest rate exchange agreements with a notional amount of billion matured during during and  interest rate exchange agreements increased interest expense by million and million  respectively 
the agreements had a weighted average maturity of approximately eight months at december  at december   the corporation also had interest rate exchange agreements a collar that effectively capped million of floating rate obligations to a maximum interest rate of and established a minimum interest rate on such obligations of 
the corporation s interest expense is unaffected by this agreement when the market interest rate falls within this range 
during and  these agreements decreased interest expense by million and million  respectively 
the agreements had a weighted average maturity of approximately three years at december  the corporation s international operations create exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks 
at december  and december   the corporation had outstanding approximately million net of discount and million net of discount  respectively  of euro denominated bonds  which were designated as a hedge against its net investment in europe 
the use of this financial instrument allows the corporation to reduce its overall exposure to exchange rate movements  since the gains and losses on this instrument substantially offsets losses and gains on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
since  the argentine peso has been pegged to the us dollar at a rate of one argentine peso to one us dollar 
in january  the argentine government announced its intent to create a dual currency system with an official fixed exchange rate of pesos to us dollar for import and export transactions  and a free floating exchange rate for other transactions 
the corporation has a small investment in argentina  for which the effect of this devaluation of the argentine peso was insignificant

prior to  the corporation sold certain assets for million and agreed to lease the assets back from the purchaser over a period of years 
under the agreement with the purchaser  the corporation agreed to maintain a deposit initially in the amount of million that  together with interest earned thereon  was expected to be sufficient to fund the corporation s lease obligation  including the repurchase of assets at the end of the term 
this transaction was accounted for as a financing arrangement 
at the inception of the agreement  the corporation recorded on its balance sheet an asset for the deposit from the sale of million and a liability for the lease obligation of million 
the sale of these assets to domtar in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements required the corporation to repurchase these assets from the lessor 
accordingly  the lessor and the corporation agreed to a deferred payment arrangement essentially under the same terms as the original lease obligation 
the corporation agreed to maintain the original deposit under its existing terms and create a second deposit 
the sum of these deposits approximately million at december  approximates the deferred payment amount 
a legal right of set off exists between the deferred payment amount owed and the deposits and  accordingly  the corporation has recorded these transactions net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as other long term liabilities 
in  the corporation entered into a financing arrangement nz financing arrangement to enhance the return of the deposit made in connection with the sale leaseback transaction discussed above by issuing nz million of debentures due april  that were legally defeased with deposits of an equal amount 
because they were legally defeased  generally accepted accounting principles do not require the debentures and related deposits to be reflected on the corporation s consolidated balance sheets 
accordingly  the corporation has not reflected the debentures or the related deposits on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the corporation s proposed separation of its consumer products and packaging business and its building products business necessitated a termination of the nz financing arrangement 
because the termination process had commenced before the proposed separation was indefinitely suspended  the entire nz financing arrangement terminated in december in conjunction with the pre sales of timberlands formerly located in california and maine  the corporation received notes from the purchasers totaling million 
the notes received from the california sales were monetized through the issuance of notes payable and commercial paper secured by the notes  and the notes received from the maine sale the maine notes were monetized through the issuance of notes payable in a private placement with the proceeds from such monetizations being used to repay debt 
proceeds from the notes received from the purchasers are being used to fund payments required for the notes payable 
the notes receivable are classified as other assets and the notes payable are classified as other long term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

georgia pacific s strategy is to improve its portfolio of businesses by divesting or exiting non strategic businesses  and by acquiring and investing in businesses that are high value added and that position georgia pacific closer to consumers 
a key component of that strategy is improving the corporation s bath tissue  paper towel and napkin business  which is commonly referred to as the tissue business 
the corporation believes that its acquisition of fort james corporation in directly facilitated that strategy 
in  in connection with the corporation s redirection of its focus away from commodity based businesses  the corporation sold a portion of its pulp and paper assets to domtar inc and completed the spin off of the timber company and its merger with and into plum creek 
in may  the corporation s board of directors approved separating georgia pacific s consumer products  packaging and bleached pulp and paper businesses along with its remaining interest in the unisource paper distribution business from the corporation s building products manufacturing and distribution business 
after this separation  the corporation would have consisted of only the building products manufacturing and distribution business 
in september this separation was indefinitely suspended in light of conditions in the financial and capital markets  operating results in georgia pacific s two principal businesses  and the market s perception of its asbestos liabilities 
other the corporation employs approximately  people  approximately  of whom are members of unions 
the corporation considers its relationship with its employees to be good 
forty union contracts are subject to negotiation and renewal in  including ten at large facilities 
the corporation is a party to various legal proceedings incidental to its business and is subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which it operates 
as is the case with other companies in similar industries  the corporation faces exposure from actual or potential claims and legal proceedings involving environmental matters 
liability insurance in effect during the last several years provides only very limited coverage for environmental matters 
the corporation is involved in environmental remediation activities at approximately sites  both owned by the corporation and owned by others  where it has been notified that it is or may be a potentially responsible party prp under the united states comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or similar state superfund laws 
of the known sites in which it is involved  the corporation estimates that approximately are being investigated  approximately are being remediated and approximately are being monitored an activity that occurs after either site investigation or remediation has been completed 
the ultimate costs to the corporation for the investigation  remediation and monitoring of many of these sites cannot be predicted with certainty  due to the often unknown nature and magnitude of the pollution or the necessary cleanup  the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods  the amount of time necessary to accomplish such cleanups  the evolving nature of cleanup technologies and governmental regulations  and the inability to determine the corporation s share of multiparty cleanups or the extent to which contribution will be available from other parties  all of which factors are taken into account to the extent possible in estimating the corporation s liabilities 
the corporation has established reserves for environmental remediation costs for these sites that it believes are probable and reasonably able to be estimated 
to the extent that the corporation is aware of unasserted claims  considers them probable  and can estimate their potential costs  the corporation includes appropriate amounts in the reserves 

table of contents based on analyses of currently available information and previous experience with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances  the corporation believes it is reasonably possible that costs associated with these sites may exceed current reserves by amounts that may prove insignificant or that could range  in the aggregate  up to approximately million 
this estimate of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is less certain than the estimates upon which reserves are based  and in order to establish the upper limit of such range  assumptions least favorable to the corporation among the range of reasonably possible outcomes were used 
in estimating both its current reserve for environmental remediation and the possible range of additional costs  the corporation has not assumed it will bear the entire cost of remediation of every site to the exclusion of other known prps who may be jointly and severally liable 
the ability of other prps to participate has been taken into account  based generally on their financial condition and probable contribution on a per site basis

kalamazoo river superfund site the corporation is implementing an administrative order by consent aoc entered into with the michigan department of natural resources and the united states environmental protection agency united states epa regarding an investigation of the kalamazoo river superfund site 
the kalamazoo river superfund site is comprised of miles of the kalamazoo river  three miles of portage creek and a number of operable units in the form of landfills  waste disposal areas and impoundments 
the corporation became a prp for the site in december by signing the aoc 
there are two other named prps at this time 
the contaminant of concern is polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in the river sediments and residuals in the landfills and waste disposal areas 
a draft remedial investigation feasibility study ri fs for the kalamazoo river was submitted to the state of michigan on october  by the corporation and other prps 
the draft ri fs evaluated five remedial options ranging from no action to total dredging of the river and off site disposal of the dredged materials 
in february  the prps  at the request of the state of michigan  also evaluated additional potential remedies 
the cost for these remedial options ranges from to billion 
the draft ri fs recommends a remedy involving stabilization of over twenty miles of riverbank and long term monitoring of the riverbed 
the total cost for this remedy is approximately million 
it is unknown over what time frame these costs will be paid out 
the united states epa has recently taken over management of the ri fs and is evaluating the proposed remedy 
the corporation cannot predict what impact or change will result from the united states epa s assuming management of the site 

table of contents the corporation is paying of the costs for the river portion of the ri fs investigation based on an interim allocation 
this interim allocation includes the share assumed by fort james prior to its acquisition by the corporation 
several other companies have been identified by government agencies as prps  and all but one is believed to be financially viable 
the corporation is currently engaged in cost recovery litigation against two other parties  and has identified several more parties that it believes have some share of liability for the river 
the corporation  as part of implementing the aoc  has investigated the closure of two disposal areas which are contaminated with pcbs 
the cost to remediate one of the disposal areas  the king highway landfill  was approximately million 
the remediation of that area is essentially complete and the corporation is waiting for final approval of the closure from the state of michigan 
a year post closure care period will begin upon receipt of closure approval 
expenditures accrued for post closure care will be made over the following years 
the corporation is solely responsible for closure and post closure care of the king highway landfill 
it is anticipated that the cost for closure of the second disposal area  the willow boulevard a site landfill  will be approximately million 
the corporation is still negotiating the final closure agreement with the state of michigan 
it is anticipated these costs will be paid out over the next five years  and for post closure care for years following certification of the closure 
the corporation is solely responsible for closure and post closure care of the willow boulevard portion of the landfill  and is sharing investigation costs for the a site portion of the landfill with millennium holdings on an equal basis 
a final determination as to how closure and post closure costs for the a site will be allocated between the corporation and millennium holdings has not been made  however  the corporation s share should not exceed 
the corporation has spent approximately million on the kalamazoo river superfund site through december  broken down as follows site in millions river king highway a site willow blvd all such amounts were charged to earnings 
the reserve for the kalamazoo river superfund site is based on the assumption that the bank stabilization remedy will be selected as the final remedy by the united states epa and the state of michigan  and that the costs of the remedy will be shared by several other prps 
based on analyses of currently available information and previous experience with respect to the cleanup of hazardous substances  the corporation believes that the reserves are adequate  however  it is reasonably possible that costs associated with the kalamazoo river superfund site may exceed current reserves by amounts that may prove insignificant or that could range  in the aggregate  up to approximately million 
fox river site the fox river site in wisconsin is comprised of miles of the fox river and green bay 
the site was nominated by the united states epa but never finally designated as a superfund site due to contamination of the river by pcbs through wastewater discharged from the recycling of carbonless copy paper from the corporation became a prp through its acquisition of fort james 
in october  the wisconsin department of natural resources wdnr and the united states epa released for public comment a draft ri fs and proposed remedial action plan prap for the fox river and 
table of contents green bay 
the draft sets forth a proposed remedy with an estimated total cost of million 
the corporation provided comments on this plan to the relevant agencies in january those comments questioned the wdnr s assumed costs for dredging  as information from other remediation dredging projects indicated costs per cubic yard of material dredged were significantly higher than those used by wdnr 
the corporation and other prps also questioned the need to dredge the amount of sediment called for by the proposed remedy 
the corporation believes that other alternatives involving substantially less dredging would meet the risk reduction goals of wdnr 
the final cleanup alternative to be selected and implemented  the costs of the alternative  and the corporation s share of such costs  are unknown at this time 
six other companies have been identified by the governments as prps  most of which are believed to be financially viable 
under an interim allocation  the corporation is paying percent of costs incurred by the prps in analyzing and responding to the various agency reports  including the ri fs and prap 
the corporation believes its ultimate liability will be less than percent 
it is unknown over what time frame these costs will be paid out 
the corporation s reserves for the fox river site are based on the assumptions that the volume of sediment to be dredged will be less than the amount discussed in the prap  that the cost per cubic yard of sediment removed will be several times higher  as well as the corporation s estimate of its ultimate share of such liability 
given currently available information and its previous experience with respect to the clean up of hazardous substances  the corporation believes its current reserves for this site are adequate 
the wdnr is expected to issue a record of decision rod in for the portion of the fox river site into which the fort james mill discharged wastewater 
depending on the conclusions of this rod about the volume of sediment to be dredged and the permitted use of other remedies at this portion of the river  it is reasonably possible that the corporation s share of the remediation costs associated with this site may not require utilization of all such reserves  or may exceed such reserves by amounts that may prove insignificant or that could range  in the aggregate  up to approximately million 
the corporation has spent approximately million from to december  on the fox river site  some of which was spent by fort james prior to its acquisition by the corporation 
in october  the united states fish and wildlife service fws released for public comment its restoration and compensation determination plan for natural resource damages to the lower fox river and green bay 
the corporation has entered into an agreement with the wdnr and the fws that would settle claims for natural resource damages under cercla  the federal water pollution control act  and state law for approximately million  and to date has paid approximately million of this amount 
the agreement will be effective when entered by a federal district court in wisconsin 
the million to be paid under this agreement is separate and apart from any costs related to remediation of the fox river site 
in the corporation and chesapeake corporation formed a joint venture to which a chesapeake subsidiary  wisconsin tissue mills  inc  contributed tissue mills and other assets located along the fox river 
wisconsin tissue is one of the prps for the fox river site 
chesapeake and wisconsin tissue specifically retained all liabilities arising from wisconsin tissue s status as a prp  and indemnified the corporation and the joint venture against these liabilities 
in  the corporation having acquired all of chesapeake s interest sold this joint venture to svenska cellulosa aktiebolaget publ sca and indemnified sca and the joint venture against all environmental liabilities including all liabilities arising from the fox river site for which wisconsin tissue is ultimately responsible arising prior to the closing of the sca sale 
as part of the agreement pursuant to which the corporation acquired chesapeake s interest in the joint venture  chesapeake specifically agreed that the corporation would retain chesapeake s prior indemnification for such liabilities 
whatcom waterway superfund site the whatcom waterway is a federal channel located adjacent to the corporation s pulp and paper mill in bellingham  washington 
the state declared the whatcom waterway a superfund site due to historical 
table of contents contamination of sediments with woody debris  phenolics and mercury 
on march   the washington department of ecology named the corporation as a potentially liable party plp in the case 
the state is presently preparing to name other plps in the case 
an ri fs completed by the corporation identified a preferred remedial alternative comprised of a combination of dredging  capping and habitat restoration with a total estimated cost of million 
it is anticipated these costs will be paid out over the next to years 
the corporation has completed interim remedial action and habitat restoration of a portion of the site 
environmental monitoring of this portion of the site is ongoing 
the reserve for the whatcom waterway site is based on the assumptions that the million proposed remedy involving limited dredging and capping will be selected by the state of washington as the final remedy and that the cost of the remedy will be shared among a small group of plps 
the corporation has spent approximately million through december  on the whatcom waterway site  all of which was charged to earnings 
other the corporation is in discussion with the state of mississippi department of environmental quality concerning alleged prevention of significant deterioration psd violations under the clean air act

asbestos matters the corporation and many other companies are defendants in suits brought in various courts around the nation by plaintiffs who allege that they have suffered personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos containing products 
the corporation s asbestos liabilities relate primarily to joint systems products manufactured by bestwall gypsum company and the corporation s gypsum business that contained small amounts of asbestos fiber 
the corporation acquired bestwall in  and discontinued using asbestos in the manufacture of these products in these suits allege a variety of lung and other diseases based on alleged exposure to the corporation s products 
in many cases  the plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure  or that any injuries they have incurred did in fact result from exposure to the corporation s products 
virtually all asbestos suits involve multiple defendants and seek money damages 
the corporation is unable to provide any meaningful disclosure about the total amount of such damages  for the following reasons first  the corporation does not track this data in any form since it does not consider the amount of damages  if any  alleged in the initial complaint relevant in assessing its exposure to asbestos liabilities 
second  the corporation estimates that less than of the approximately  claims currently pending against it contain any specific demand for damages  as opposed to a general demand for such damages as the plaintiff may prove at trial  or a demand which is stated as being in excess of the minimum jurisdictional limit of a particular court 
third  even those complaints which do contain a specific damage demand nearly always involve multiple defendants anywhere from to over  most of which never manufactured joint systems products 
the corporation is not aware of any complaint which states a specific demand for money damages solely from the corporation 
finally  even for claims which allege specific damages  plaintiffs lawyers often allege the same amount of damages regardless of the specific disease a plaintiff may have 
in addition  in many such cases no specific disease is alleged  and thus the damages alleged are meaningless because the ultimate settlement value of any claim is significantly influenced by the actual disease the plaintiff is able to prove 

table of contents the following table presents information about the approximate number of the corporation s asbestos claims during the past three fiscal years fiscal year ended claims filed claims resolved claims unresolved at end of period claims filed includes all asbestos claims for which service has been received and or a file has been opened by the corporation and each such claim represents a plaintiff who is pursuing an asbestos claim against the corporation 
claims resolved includes asbestos claims which have been settled or dismissed or which are in the process of being settled or dismissed based upon agreements or understandings in place with counsel for the claimants 
in addition  fort james corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation  currently is defending approximately asbestos premises liability claims 
from the commencement of this litigation through december   the corporation either had settled  had dismissed or was in the process of settling a total of approximately  asbestos claims 
for this same period the corporation s asbestos payments  for liability  defense and administration  before insurance recoveries and tax benefits  totaled approximately million 
the corporation generally settles asbestos claims for amounts it considers reasonable given the facts and circumstances of each claim 
in the fall of  the corporation retained national economic research associates nera and peterson consulting  nationally recognized consultants in asbestos liability and insurance  to work with it to project the amount  net of insurance  that it would pay for its asbestos related liabilities and defense costs through based on the analysis of nera and peterson consulting  at the end of the corporation established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable asbestos liabilities and defense costs it believed it would pay through  and established receivables for insurance recoveries that were deemed probable 
in the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded a pre tax charge to earnings of million to cover the projected asbestos liabilities and defense costs  net of expected insurance recoveries  it expected to pay through nera s estimate was based on historical data supplied by the corporation and publicly available studies 
nera concluded that  based on the latency periods of asbestos related diseases both cancers and non cancers  the peak incidence of such diseases occurred prior to it expected  based on the last dates of manufacture of asbestos containing products in the united states  that the number of new diagnoses of asbestosis and other non cancerous diseases would drop beginning in it also cited annual surveys of the national cancer institutes that show the annual incidence of mesothelioma began to decline in the mid s 
nera expected these factors  as well as the advancing age of the allegedly exposed population  its movement away from work centers as its members retire  and nera s view that many asbestos claims filed in the s were based in part on mass screenings of possibly exposed individuals  would result in the number of claims filed against the corporation for asbestos related injuries beginning to decline in while the number of new claims filed against the corporation in was slightly higher than in  the corporation is of the view that the number of new claims filed against it is consistent with nera s estimate 
however  during the corporation paid  pre tax and before insurance  approximately million for its asbestos liabilities and defense costs  which was million more than the corporation expected to pay based on nera s estimate 
these higher payments were caused by a million judgment which the corporation paid in one case decided on appeal by the maryland supreme court in  and higher than expected settlements paid in less than of the total cases it resolved in  all of which involved mesothelioma claims 
during  the corporation paid  pre tax and before insurance  about million for its asbestos liabilities and defense costs 
because of s higher asbestos liabilities and defense costs  the corporation asked nera to review its original estimate and adjust it as needed 
nera s revised estimate shows that the corporation s total  undiscounted asbestos liabilities  including defense costs  over the ten year period from through will 
table of contents be slightly less than billion  before any insurance recoveries and ignoring any possible tax benefits 
the principal factor contributing to the increase in nera s total estimate is the projected effect of the higher indemnity and defense costs the corporation experienced in on its costs in future years 
in addition  nera extended its original estimate through  which accounted for approximately million of the total accrual  before insurance 
the corporation believes that nera s projection represents its best estimate of the reasonably estimable asbestos costs it will incur based upon currently available information 
as they did at the end of  peterson consulting and the corporation reviewed the corporation s existing insurance policies and agreements  engaged in discussions with counsel to the corporation  analyzed publicly available information bearing on the creditworthiness of the corporation s various insurers  and employed insurance allocation methodologies which the corporation and peterson consulting believed appropriate to ascertain the amount of probable insurance recoveries from the corporation s insurers for the accrued asbestos liabilities 
the analysis took into account self insurance reserves  policy exclusions  liability caps and gaps in the corporation s coverage  as well as insolvencies among certain of the corporation s insurance carriers 
although the corporation and peterson consulting believe these assumptions are appropriate  there are other assumptions that could have been employed that would have resulted in materially lower insurance recovery estimates 
based on this analysis  the corporation s total expected insurance recoveries for its projected asbestos liabilities and costs over the period through will be about million 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of the corporation recorded an additional pre tax charge to earnings of million which  when added to amounts remaining from charges recorded in  it believes are sufficient to cover its projected asbestos liabilities and defense costs  net of expected insurance recoveries 
the corporation has recorded the reserves for its asbestos liabilities as other current liabilities and other long term liabilities  and the related insurance recoveries as other current assets and other assets  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the following table summarizes accruals to  and payments from  the corporation s reserve for its total asbestos personal injury liabilities  and receipts from its insurance carriers  and additions to its expected insurance receivables  for the last three fiscal years dollars in thousands fiscal year ended asbestos liabilities beginning balance accruals payments ending balance insurance receivable beginning balance receipts accruals ending balance the accrual for included approximately million as a result of nera extending its original projection to include the charge to earnings taken in the fourth quarter of is due to the increase in the corporation s projected asbestos liabilities contained in nera s revised estimate  insolvencies of certain insurance companies which wrote a part of the corporation s excess layers of product liability insurance  as well as assumptions by the corporation and peterson consulting about the outcome of likely allocation and coverage issues involving such insurance 
the insurance receivable recorded by the corporation does not assume any recovery from insolvent carriers  and assumes that those carriers which are currently solvent will continue to be solvent throughout the period of nera s estimate 
however  there can be no assurances that these assumptions will be correct 
substantially all of the insurance recoveries deemed probable are from insurance companies rated a excellent 
table of contents or better by am best company 
no more than of such insurance recoveries are from any one company  though several of the insurers are under common control 
the corporation has limited amounts of product liability insurance remaining beyond the amounts recorded for the period through the analyses of nera and peterson consulting in both and are based on their professional judgment 
the more important assumptions in nera s projection of the number of claims that will be filed against the corporation include the population exposed to asbestos containing products manufactured by the corporation  the expected occurrence of various diseases in these exposed populations  the rate at which these exposed populations actually file claims  and activities of the asbestos plaintiffs bar designed to maximize its profits from such claims 
the cost of settling claims is driven by these same assumptions  as well as by prevailing judicial and social environments in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed  the rulings by judges and the attitudes of juries in those jurisdictions  the demands of the asbestos plaintiffs bar with respect to the value of each such claim  the insolvencies of other defendants to a particular claim  and the impact of verdicts against other defendants on settlement demands against the corporation 
generally  nera s projections assume that the number of new claims to be filed against the corporation each year through will decline at a fairly constant rate each year beginning in  that the percentage of claims settled by the corporation will be about three quarters of the total number of claims resolved whether by settlement or dismissal each year through  that the average estimated per case settlement costs  as adjusted to reflect the higher indemnity costs experienced in  are anticipated to decrease slightly over the period through  and that the total amounts paid by the corporation in settlements  and in defense and administrative costs  will decline at varying rates over the period through among the more important assumptions made by peterson in projecting the corporation s future insurance recoveries are the resolution of allocation issues among various layers of insurers  the application of particular theories of recovery based on decided cases  and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies 
given these assumptions  and the uncertainties involved in each of them  the corporation s actual asbestos liabilities  defense costs and insurance recoveries could be higher or lower than those currently projected and or recorded 
however  these assumptions are only some of those contained in the nera and peterson projections  and all of such assumptions are only one aspect of the overall projections made by those firms 
changes in the foregoing assumptions  or others  whether from time to time or over the period covered by such projections  may or may not affect the validity of the overall projections 
the corporation intends to monitor its accrued asbestos liabilities  defense costs and insurance recoveries against these overall projections  and will make adjustments to such accruals as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
for all of these reasons  there can be no assurance that the corporation s currently accrued asbestos liabilities will be accurate  that its accrued insurance recoveries will be realized  or that the corporation will not be required in the future to incur additional charges relating thereto 
given these uncertainties  the corporation believes that it is reasonably possible that it will incur asbestos liabilities for the period through and beyond in amounts in excess of the nera estimate  but cannot estimate such excess amount at this time 
the corporation believes that it is reasonably possible that such excess liabilities could be material to its operating results in any given quarter or year but  based on the information available to it at present  does not believe that it is reasonably possible that such excess liabilities would have a material adverse effect on its long term results of operations  liquidity or consolidated financial position 
critical accounting policies a summary of the corporation s significant accounting policies is included in note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the consistent application of these policies enables 
table of contents the corporation to provide readers of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the corporation s operating results and financial condition 
the following are accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the corporation s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
judgments and assessments of uncertainties are required in applying the corporation s accounting policies in many areas 
for example  key assumptions are particularly important when determining amounts allocated to identifiable intangible assets in a business combination and in developing the corporation s projected liabilities for pension and other postretirement benefits 
other areas in which significant uncertainties exist include  but are not limited to  projected costs to be incurred in connection with environmental and legal matters  including its asbestos liabilities 
the corporation recognizes a liability for environmental remediation and legal indemnification and defense costs when it believes it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the liabilities are developed based on currently available information and reflect the participation of other potentially responsible parties  depending on the parties financial condition and probable contribution 
the accruals are recorded at undiscounted amounts and are reflected as liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the corporation also has insurance that covers losses on certain environmental claims and records receivables to the extent that the realization of the insurance is deemed probable 
this receivable is recorded at an undiscounted amount and is reflected as an asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  management uses judgment in assessing goodwill  and other long lived assets for impairment 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 the corporation has assessed the recoverability of its goodwill 
after the transition  the corporation will review the recorded value of its goodwill annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
recoverability is determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value  including goodwill  of that reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
goodwill totaled billion at december  and represented of total assets 
the corporation assesses its long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
to analyze recoverability  the corporation projects undiscounted net future cash flows over the remaining life of such assets 
if these projected cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment would be recognized  resulting in a write down of assets with a corresponding charge to earnings 
the impairment loss is measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets 
accounting changes in the first quarter of  the corporation changed its method of computing lifo inventory increments from year to date average cost to latest acquisition cost 
the corporation believes that the latest acquisition cost more closely aligns the value of increases in inventory with physical quantities giving rise to the increases and that this method more appropriately reflects the underlying substance of changes in inventory 
in addition  the corporation changed its method of pooling lifo inventories from a statutory legal entity approach to an approach that allows the alignment by business segment 
the corporation believes that this approach results in better matching of costs to revenues in a manner that is more consistent with the way the businesses are managed 
the cumulative effect of these changes on prior years was not determinable 
these changes did not have a material effect on results of operations or financial position

factors that may affect future results some of the matters discussed in this form k and the accompanying annual review concerning  among other things  the business outlook  anticipated financial and operating results  strategies  contingencies and contemplated transactions of the corporation  constitute forward looking statements and are based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events 
there can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the corporation s results will be as estimated 
in some cases  the forward looking statements contained in this form k and the accompanying annual review can be identified by terminology such as may  will  should  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  or estimates  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements are only predictions 
therefore  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which are based on information known today and speak only as of the date of the filing of this form k 
moreover  in the future  the corporation  through its senior management team  may make additional or different forward looking statements about the matters described in this document 
the corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly revise any of these forward looking statements to reflect changes in the facts or information on which they are based or any events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof 
actual events or future results may differ materially as a result of the following factors  as well as other factors described elsewhere in this form k  or in the corporation s other sec filings  including the corporation s form k  dated october   and form k  dated january   which are incorporated herein by this reference 
the following factors  which the corporation cautions are not exclusive  are described in accordance with the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  which encourages companies to disclose these factors 
the corporation has substantial indebtedness 
as described in this form k and the accompanying annual review  the corporation has substantial indebtedness 
the corporation s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to repay its outstanding indebtedness will depend in part on cash from operations and in part on cash produced by divestitures of some of the corporation s businesses 
there can be no assurance that such divestitures will be consummated  or  if consummated  that the price and terms of such divestitures will be advantageous to the corporation 
further  there can be no assurance that the corporation s businesses will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  as they are subject to general economic  business  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond the corporation s control 
the corporation s level of indebtedness has important consequences  including limiting the corporation s ability to invest operating cash flow to expand its business  to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures or adverse changes in governmental regulation  because it must dedicate a substantial portion of these cash flows to service its debt 
in addition  the corporation could  under certain circumstances that management believes are unlikely to occur  be unable to refinance or obtain additional financing because of market conditions  its high levels of debt and the debt restrictions under its current debt agreements 
on january   moody s investors service announced that it had downgraded the corporation s senior implied and issuer debt ratings from ba to ba and the corporation s senior unsecured notes from ba to ba moody s rating actions affected approximately billion of debt securities 
on january   fitch ratings announced that it had lowered the corporation s senior unsecured long term debt ratings from bb to bb and withdrawn the corporation s commercial paper rating 
fitch s rating action with respect to the bb rating 
table of contents affected billion of debt securities 
there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances in the future so warrant 
any future reductions in the corporation s debt ratings could increase the costs of the corporation s future short term financings 
execution of transformation strategy 
the corporation s long term strategy is to improve its portfolio of businesses by divesting or exiting non strategic businesses  and by acquiring and expanding businesses which are high value added and that position georgia pacific closer to its customers 
a key to this transformation will be the corporation s tissue business  which was expanded significantly with the acquisition of fort james corporation in late although the corporation believes that it has a strong cost position  superior manufacturing expertise and excellent brands  this business faces competition from established companies that may have more experience or expertise in marketing  advertising and brand management than the corporation currently has 
to succeed  the corporation must continue to develop brand recognition and loyalty  product quality and performance  price  marketing and distribution capabilities 
aggressive reaction by competitors may lead to increased advertising and promotional spending by the corporation in order to maintain market share in this segment as well as others 
in addition  to successfully achieve its strategy the corporation will need to rely heavily on the development and introduction of new products and product line extensions as a means of achieving and or maintaining leadership in various product categories 
competition and volatility of commodity businesses 
the corporation faces intense competition from both large international and small domestic producers in most of its businesses 
however  operating results are particularly volatile for the corporation s building products and pulp and paper businesses because most of these products are commodities  for which price is the principal competitive factor 
the corporation cannot control such factors as decreasing demand from customers or increasing supply from competitors  both of which cause price decreases for such products which adversely affects the corporation s net sales  operating income and cash flows 
costs associated with environmental compliance and remediation and litigation 
as more fully discussed under note of the notes to consolidated financial statements which are presented under item of this form k  the corporation s operations are subject to significant regulation by federal  state and local environmental and safety authorities 
the costs of compliance with existing and new regulatory schemes could require significant capital expenditures that would decrease the amount of funds available for investment in other areas of the corporation s operations 
for example  the united states environmental protection agency has recently issued new air emission regulations  known as mact or maximum achievable control technology regulations 
the costs of compliance with these regulations and additional or supplementary regulations cannot be definitively quantified and there can be no assurance that the costs of such compliance will not be material to the corporation s results of operations in certain reporting periods 
in addition  the costs of remediating known environmental sites  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  in some instances has been significant and remediation of future sites could also be significant 
there can be no assurance that the final remediation costs will equal currently estimated costs or that additional sites will not require significant remediation expenses 
the corporation is subject to litigation risks that are similar to other corporations of its size and complexity in an increasingly litigious environment 
while the corporation does not believe that any of these matters will be material to its long term financial status  as disclosed under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  certain litigation related matters may be material to the corporation s results of operations in certain reporting periods 

table of contents costs associated with asbestos liabilities and litigation 
in fiscal and  working with national economic research associates nera and peterson consulting  its external consultants  georgia pacific recorded pre tax charges totaling million for asbestos liabilities and defense costs  net of anticipated insurance recoveries that it expects to pay through projecting liabilities for asbestos litigation is subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties  including the possibility that the number of asbestos claims filed against the corporation in the future will be greater than projected  the risk that the cost of defending and settling current and future asbestos claims will be higher than projected  resulting in more rapid depletion of available insurance coverage and higher out of pocket costs  the possibility of additional insolvencies among insurance carriers  the risk that final resolution of allocation  coverage or other issues affecting available insurance coverage will result in lower insurance recoveries than forecast  the possibility that adverse jury verdicts could require us to pay damages in amounts greater than the amounts for which georgia pacific now settles cases  and the risk that bankruptcies of other asbestos defendants may increase costs in the future 
these or other factors could cause the corporation s actual liabilities to be materially higher  and its insurance recoveries to be materially lower  than those projected and recorded to date 
if these or other factors cause georgia pacific to determine that the assumptions used by nera or peterson consulting in their latest projections are no longer reasonable  or if it determines that its asbestos exposure net of insurance recoveries for years after is material  the corporation may have to establish additional reserves relating to asbestos beyond the charges already taken  and the amount of these reserves may be material  but the corporation cannot estimate the amount of any such additional reserves at this time
