as a result of these transactions  we recorded a primarily non cash compensation charge of million during during we also reversed million of accruals from restructuring charges recorded in years prior to due to actual costs being lower than originally estimated

we are forecasting an effective tax rate of percent for cumulative effect of accounting change in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires the use of a nonamortization approach to account for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
under the nonamortization approach  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will not be amortized but instead will be reviewed for impairment and written down with a resulting charge to operations in the period in which the recorded value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value 
the adoption of sfas required us to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets and make any necessary amortization adjustments 
based on that assessment  no adjustments were made to the amortization period or residual values of our intangible assets 
additionally  sfas required us to perform an evaluation of whether goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were impaired as of january   the effective date of the statement for the company 
sfas provided a six month transitional period from the effective date of adoption to perform our initial assessment of whether an indication of goodwill impairment exists 
this initial assessment compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
fair value was determined using a combination of discounted cash flow and multiple of earnings valuation techniques 
to the extent that the fair value is less than the carrying value  we are required to perform a second test to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment  if any 

table of contents during  we completed our transitional assessment in accordance with sfas to determine if goodwill was impaired as of january  as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of million million  net of tax in our statement of operations reflecting the cumulative effect of the accounting change to adjust goodwill to its current fair value 
the international distribution segment and laboratory workstations segment accounted for million and million of the charge  respectively 
the impairment charge in the international distribution segment related to certain of our smaller market distribution businesses where operating performance was lower than originally forecasted 
our laboratory workstations segment is sensitive to changes in capital spending  and several of the markets to which the laboratory workstations segment sells  including the technology industry  experienced a significant economic slowdown causing a reduction in capital spending in those markets 
as a result  sales growth was significantly less than originally forecasted  resulting in decreased profitability 
sfas also requires that goodwill be tested annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have elected to perform the annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of october of each year 
as of october   there were no additional impairments of goodwill 
future impairments of goodwill  if any  will be recorded to operating income in our statement of operations 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   cash generated from operating activities was million compared with million in the increase in cash from operations is due to an increase in net income offset primarily by million in cash pension contributions and million of spending related to our restructuring plans 
we expect cash flow from operations to be between million and million in during  we used million of cash for investing activities compared with million in the change in cash used for investing activities is primarily attributable to a decrease in acquisition spending 
capital expenditures totaled million in compared with million in we expect to invest approximately million in capital expenditures in  reflecting continued facility consolidation and increased investment in our chemical manufacturing and pharmaceutical services 
in july  we acquired a netherlands based distributor operating under the names retsch and emergo for a purchase price of million and in november we acquired two companies named maybridge and mimotopes

on february   the company entered into a new credit facility the credit facility with a group of financial institutions  consisting of i a million term loan facility the term facility  which contains a provision that  upon the company s future request  and subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions  an additional million incremental term 
table of contents facility may be drawn the incremental term facility and ii a million revolving credit facility the revolving facility 
the revolving facility includes a sub limit for the issuance of letters of credit 
commitments under the revolving facility expire on march  the term facility requires the company to make quarterly repayments of principal equal to million through march   and quarterly repayments of principal equal to million beginning june  through the maturity of the term facility on march  the credit facility replaces the previous credit facility entered into in january in addition  on february   the company  through its subsidiary fisher scientific company llc  borrowed million of the million available under the revolving facility to refinance amounts outstanding under the revolving credit portion of the previous credit facility entered into in proceeds from the percent senior subordinated notes and the term facility were used to refinance the company s percent senior subordinated notes due in in conjunction with the refinancing of the percent senior subordinated notes  the company expects to incur a charge of approximately million consisting of million of call premiums to be paid in cash and million of non cash deferred financing fees and other costs 
the company is anticipating that this refinancing will reduce interest expense in by approximately million to million 
on february   the company entered into a new million receivables security facility receivables securitization  which provides for the sale  on a revolving basis  of all of the accounts receivable of fisher scientific company llc  cole parmer instrument company  fisher clinical services inc  and fisher hamilton llc to fsi receivables company llc  formerly named fsi receivables corp

we expect to satisfy our short term funding requirements from free operating cash flow  together with cash and cash equivalents on hand or available through the new credit facility 
a change in demand for the company s goods and services  while unlikely  would reduce free operating cash flow available to fund our operations 
if such a decrease in demand were significant and free operating cash flow were reduced significantly  we could utilize the receivables securitization facility see
