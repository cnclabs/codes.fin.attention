overview in analyzing the financial results of the partnership  the following matters should be considered 
the primary use of heating oil  propane and natural gas is for space heating in residential and commercial applications 
as a result  weather conditions have a significant impact on financial performance and should be considered when analyzing changes in financial performance 
in addition  gross margins vary according to customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers generate higher profit margins than sales to other customer groups  such as agricultural customers 
accordingly  a change in customer mix can affect gross margins without necessarily impacting total sales 
the following is a discussion of the historical condition and results of operations of star gas partners  lp and its subsidiaries  and should be read in conjunction with the historical financial and operating data and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  volume for fiscal  retail volume of home heating oil and propane increased million gallons  or  to million gallons  as compared to million gallons for fiscal this increase was due to a million gallon increase in the heating oil segment and a million gallon increase in the propane segment 
the increase in volume primarily reflects the impact of significantly colder temperatures and the impact of an additional million gallons provided by acquisitions 
customer attrition  largely in the home heating oil segment s lower margin commercial business  partially offset these volume increases 
the partnership also believes that a planned shift in the delivery pattern at the heating oil segment  designed to increase efficiency  decreased volume for fiscal by an estimated million gallons 
typical delivery patterns would have resulted in these gallons being delivered in fiscal but were actually delivered in the three months ended september  temperatures in the partnership s areas of operations were an average of colder than in the prior year s comparable period and approximately colder than normal as reported by the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa 
sales for fiscal  sales increased million  or  to  million  as compared to  million for fiscal this increase was due to million higher home heating oil sales  million higher propane segment sales and a million increase in tg e sales 
sales increased largely due to the higher retail volume sold and as a result of higher selling prices 
selling prices increased versus the prior year s comparable period in response to higher supply costs 
sales of rationally related products  including heating and air conditioning equipment installation and service and water softeners increased by million in the heating oil segment and by million in the propane segment from the prior year s comparable period due to acquisitions  price increases and from colder temperatures 
cost of product for fiscal  cost of product increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to million of higher cost of product at the home heating oil segment  million higher cost of product at the propane segment and a million increase in tg e cost of product 
cost of product increased largely due to the higher retail volume sold and from higher supply cost 
while selling prices and supply cost both increased on a per gallon basis  the increase in selling prices was equal to the increase in supply costs  which resulted in approximately the same per gallon margins 
cost of installations  service and appliances for fiscal  cost of installations  service and appliances increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to an additional million in the heating oil segment and by million in the propane segment from the prior year s comparable period due to the increase in sales of these products and from additional cost of service expenses resulting from the colder temperatures 
delivery and branch expenses for fiscal  delivery and branch expenses increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to an additional million of delivery and branch expenses at the heating oil segment and a million increase in delivery and branch expenses for the propane segment 
the period to period comparison was impacted by the purchase of weather insurance that allowed the partnership to record approximately million of net weather insurance recoveries in the fiscal period versus a million expense in the fiscal period for weather insurance premiums paid 
the remaining increase in delivery and branch expenses of million for fiscal  was largely due to the additional operating cost associated with increased volumes delivered  higher marketing costs at the heating oil segment of million  higher bad debt expense of million at the heating oil segment  higher bad debt expense of million at the propane segment and to the impact of operating expense and wage increases 
depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  approximately million of goodwill amortization was included in depreciation and amortization expense 
as of october   goodwill is no longer amortized in accordance to sfas no 
depreciation and amortization expense related to acquisitions and fixed asset additions acquired after september   resulted in increases which partially offset the decrease attributable to goodwill amortization 

table of contents general and administrative expenses for fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was largely due to the inclusion of million of incremental expense related to the business process redesign project in the heating oil segment  a million increase in the accrual for compensation earned for unit appreciation rights and restricted stock awards previously granted and for other increases of million  largely due to increased bonus compensation based upon results for fiscal million  higher legal and professional expenses at the partnership level million and for increased expenses at the propane segment million for its increased size 
the increase in legal and professional expenses at the partnership level largely were incurred for sarbanes compliance  acquisitions and financing related issues 
the increase was partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses at tg e of approximately million  largely due to lower bad debt million and collection expenses 
the heating oil segment continued to progress with its business reorganization project during fiscal the heating oil segment is seeking to take advantage of its large size to utilize technology to increase the efficiency and quality of services provided to its customers 
the segment is seeking to create a more customer oriented service company to significantly differentiate itself from its competitive peers 
a core business process redesign project began in fiscal with an exhaustive effort to identify customer expectations and document existing business processes 
these findings led to a conclusion that improved processes  consolidation of operations  technology investments and selective outsourcing would have a meaningful impact on improving customer services while reducing annual operating costs 
consolidation of certain heating oil operational activities have been undertaken to create operating efficiencies and cost savings 
service technicians are being dispatched from two consolidated locations rather than local offices 
oil delivery is now being managed from regional locations rather than local offices 
the organization continues to adjust to these significant operational changes 
a transition to outsourcing in the area of customer relationship management has been undertaken as both a customer satisfaction and a cost reduction strategy 
the partnership believes outsourcing customer inquiries will improve performance and leverage technology to eliminate system redundancy available from third party service organizations 
in addition  an outsourcing partner has greater flexibility to manage extreme seasonal volume 
significant challenges remain with this dramatic transition 
the complexity of customer interactions combined with the partnership s goal for service excellence has led to protracted training efforts 
the heating oil segment has begun introducing call based technology enhancements including capabilities for customer inquiries via automated interactive telephone response and the web 
while the physical transition is largely complete  the partnership anticipates that supplementary training and support will be required through the heating season 
the million incremental expense in fiscal million of actual fiscal expense related to this redesign project largely consisted of consulting fees  employee termination benefits and separation cost and travel related expenditures 
in connection with this plan  the partnership reduced the size of its work force and recognized a liability of approximately million related to certain employee termination benefits and separation costs 
by the completion of the program  total expenditures are estimated to be million 
through september   total expenditures for the program were million with the balance to be spent in fiscal it is anticipated that the program will improve operating income by approximately million annually of which million is expected to be realized in fiscal  with the remainder in fiscal and fiscal while the partnership believes that these levels of savings will be realized  there can be no assurance that these amounts will actually be forthcoming  or that other events will not offset the expected benefits 
interest expense for fiscal  interest expense increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was largely due to additional interest expense of million for higher average outstanding working capital borrowings and due to additional interest related to the higher interest rate on the partnership s million debt offering partially offset by interest expense related to the debt repaid with the offering 
income tax expense for fiscal  income tax expense increased million to million  as compared to a tax benefit of million for fiscal this increase was due to higher state income taxes based upon the higher pretax earnings achieved for fiscal and the absence in fiscal of the tax benefit from a federal tax loss carryback of million recorded in fiscal 
table of contents cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for fiscal  the partnership recorded a million decrease in net income arising from the adoption of sfas no 
to reflect the impairment of its goodwill for its tg e segment 
net income for fiscal  net income increased million  or  to million  as compared to a loss of million for fiscal the increase was due to a million increase in net income at the heating oil segment  a million increase in net income at the propane segment and by a million decrease in the net loss at tg e partially offset by a million increase in the net loss at the partnership level 
the increase in net income was primarily due to the impact of colder weather and lower depreciation and amortization partially offset by the million decrease in net income at the tg e segment resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  volume for fiscal  retail volume of home heating oil and propane increased million gallons  or  to million gallons  as compared to million gallons for fiscal this increase was due to a million gallon increase in the heating oil segment and a million gallon increase in the propane segment 
the increase in volume reflects the impact of an additional million gallons provided by acquisitions  which was largely offset by the impact of significantly warmer temperatures and to a much lesser extent by customer attrition in the heating oil segment 
the partnership also believes that a shift in the delivery pattern at the heating oil segment increased volume in fiscal by an estimated million gallons 
temperatures in the partnership s areas of operations were an average of warmer than in the prior year s comparable period and approximately warmer than normal 
the abnormally warm weather made the past heating season the warmest in over a hundred years with temperatures approximately higher than the next warmest year in the century 
sales for fiscal  sales decreased million  or  to approximately billion  as compared to approximately billion for fiscal this decrease was due to million lower propane segment sales and million lower tg e sales partially offset by a million increase in sales at the heating oil segment 
sales decreased largely as a result of lower selling prices which were only partially offset by sales from the higher retail volume in the heating oil and propane segments 
selling prices  in all segments  decreased versus the prior year s comparable period in response to lower product commodity costs 
sales of rationally related products  including heating and air conditioning equipment installation and service and water softeners increased in the heating oil segment by million and by million in the propane segment from the prior year s comparable period due to acquisitions 
tg e s sales also decreased as a result of lower electricity sales from the segment s strategic decision made during fiscal to redirect its resources toward the natural gas deregulated energy markets which tg e believes offers greater potential for new opportunities and profitability 
cost of product for fiscal  cost of product decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this decrease was due to million of lower cost of product at the heating oil segment  million lower propane segment cost of product and a million lower cost of product in tg e 
cost of product decreased due to the impact of lower product commodity cost partially offset by the cost of product for the higher retail volume sales 
tg e cost of product also decreased due to the lower electricity sales 
while selling prices and supply cost decreased on a per gallon basis  the decrease in selling prices was less than the decrease in supply costs  which resulted in an increase in per gallon margins 
cost of installations  service and appliances for fiscal  cost of installations  service and appliances increased million or to million as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to an additional million in the heating oil segment and by million in the propane segment from the prior years comparable period due to the increase in sales of these products 

table of contents delivery and branch expenses for fiscal  delivery and branch expenses increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to an additional million of delivery and branch expenses at the heating oil segment and a million increase in delivery and branch expenses for the propane segment 
delivery and branch expenses increased both at the heating oil and propane segments largely due to additional operating costs associated with increased volumes delivered by acquired companies and due to the impact of price and wage increases 
due to the fixed component of the partnership s cost structure  the significant reduction in volume caused by the extremely warm weather conditions didn t allow the partnership to completely reduce operating expenses in direct proportion to the volume reduction 
the heating oil segment s delivery and branch expense also increased by approximately million due to an increase in the estimate of the accrual required to cover certain insurance reserves 
the increase in delivery and branch expenses was mitigated by the purchase of weather insurance that allowed the partnership to record approximately million of net weather insurance recoveries 
depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization on fixed assets and intangibles other than goodwill related to heating oil and propane acquisitions 
amortization expense would be approximately million higher in fiscal if sfas no 
was not implemented 
see accounting principles not yet adopted for a further discussion of the effects of sfas no 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal the increase was due to additional general and administration expenses for acquisitions of approximately million  and for increased compensation expense of approximately million for tg e 
the increase was partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses at the partnership level of million 
the increased compensation for tg e was incurred for professional staff additions  hiring of personnel for collection efforts and for severance paid to former employees in connection with the relocation of its corporate office to new jersey 
tg e s charge to bad debt expense was approximately million in both periods 
based upon tg e s implementation of new information systems and more stringent credit policies  the partnership believes that tg e s bad debt losses should approximate the experience of the partnership s other two operating segments going forward 
general and administrative expenses were lower at the partnership level due to a reduction in the accrual for compensation earned for unit appreciation rights previously granted as well as for a million decrease in unit compensation expense 
the decrease in unit compensation expense was due to a reduction in the accrual for units expected to be earned versus the prior year under the partnership s unit incentive plan pursuant to which certain employees were granted senior subordinated units as an incentive for achieving specified objectives which were not achieved in fiscal the partnership has determined that these contingent units will not vest for fiscal general and administrative expenses also included approximately million of incremental expense related to an on going business process redesign project in the heating oil segment 
the heating oil segment is seeking to take advantage of its large size and utilize modern technology to increase the efficiency and quality of services provided to its customers 
the segment is seeking to create a more customer oriented service company to significantly differentiate itself from its competitive peers 
a core business process redesign project began this past fiscal year with an exhaustive effort to identify customer expectations and document existing business processes 
the customer remains the focal point for change  although significant improvement in operational efficiency is also a goal 
while the critical analysis and redesign of existing business processes continues  the segment has already documented near term opportunities for productivity and cost improvement 
preliminary conclusions indicate that improved processes and related technology investments could have a meaningful impact on reducing the heating oil segment s annual operating costs 
the million incremental expense in the fiscal year largely consisted of consulting fees and travel related expenditures 
the expenses related to the on going business process redesign project will continue into fiscal 
table of contents interest expense for fiscal  interest expense  increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to additional interest expense for the financing of propane and heating oil acquisitions partially offset by lower interest expense for working capital borrowings 
income tax expense benefit for fiscal  income tax expense decreased million  or  to a tax benefit of million  as compared to an expense of million for fiscal this decrease was due to the availability of carrying back certain federal tax losses resulting from a change in the tax laws enacted during fiscal year of approximately million and due to lower state income taxes based upon the lower pretax earnings achieved for fiscal year cumulative effect of adoption of accounting principle for fiscal  the partnership recorded a million increase in net income arising from the adoption of sfas no 
net loss for fiscal  net loss increased million  or  to million  as compared to million for fiscal the increased net loss was due to a million decrease in net income at the heating oil segment and a million increase in the net loss at tg e partially offset by a million increase in net income at the propane segment and a million reduction in the net loss at the partnership level 
the increase in the net loss was primarily due to decreased volume from the impact of the warmer weather  partially offset by a per gallon improvement in gross profit margins  net weather insurance recoveries  the tax benefit of the tax loss carryback and by net income generated from acquisitions 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the ability of star gas to satisfy its obligations will depend on its future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business  and weather conditions  and other factors  most of which are beyond its control 
capital requirements of star gas are expected to be provided by cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand at september  to the extent for fiscal  capital requirements exceed cash flows from operating activities a working capital will be financed by the partnership s working capital lines of credit and repaid from subsequent seasonal reductions in inventory and accounts receivable  b growth capital expenditures  mainly for customer tanks  will be financed in fiscal through the use of the partnership s credit facilities  and c acquisition capital expenditures will be financed by the revolving acquisition lines of credit  long term debt issuance  the issuance of additional common units or a combination thereof 
see also financing and sources of liquidity below for a discussion of the partnership s outstanding debt amortization requirements 
cash flows operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended september  was million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the fiscal year this decrease in cash provided by operating activities was largely due to an increase in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal from fiscal  primarily due to a million increase in accounts receivable largely due to the colder weather experienced in fiscal the net cash provided by operations of million for fiscal consisted of net income of million  adjusted for noncash charges of million  primarily depreciation and amortization of million  which were offset by an increase in operating assets and liabilities of million largely due to an increase in receivables from the colder temperatures experienced in fiscal investing activities 
star gas completed ten acquisitions during fiscal  investing million 
this expenditure for acquisitions is included in the cash used in investing activities of million along with the million invested for capital expenditures 
the million for capital expenditures is comprised of million of capital additions needed to sustain operations at current levels and million for capital expenditures incurred in connection with the heating oil segment s business process redesign program and for customer tanks and other capital expenditures to support growth of operations 
the capital expenditures made for the business process redesign program were largely for the purchase of modern technology to increase the efficiency and quality of services provided to its customers 
investing activities also includes proceeds from the sale of fixed assets of million 
financing activities 
during fiscal  cash provided by financing activities  included million of net proceeds from the partnership s million senior note offering in february  million from a common unit offering in august and million from the net increase in acquisition borrowings 
cash distributions paid to unitholders of million  debt repayments of million  decreased working capital borrowings of million and other financing activities of million resulted in net cash used in financing activities of million 
as a result of the above activity  cash decreased by million to million as of september  
table of contents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the fiscal year ended september   ebitda increased million  or to million as compared to million for fiscal this increase was due to million additional ebitda generated by the heating oil segment  a million additional ebitda at the propane segment and a million additional ebitda at tg e  partially offset by million reduction in ebitda at the partnership level largely due to the increase in the accrual for compensation earned for unit appreciation rights and restricted stock awards previously granted 
the increase in ebitda was largely due to the impact of colder temperatures in our areas of operations as reported by noaa 
tg e s ebitda was negatively impacted by the inclusion of a non cash million decrease in net income for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle arising from the adoption of sfas no 
to reflect the impairment of its goodwill 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations  but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to make the minimum quarterly distribution 
ebitda is calculated for the fiscal years ended september as follows fiscal year ended september  in thousands net income loss plus income tax expense benefit amortization of debt issuance costs interest expense  net depreciation and amortization ebitda financing and sources of liquidity the partnership s heating oil segment had a bank credit facility at september   which included a working capital facility  providing for up to million of borrowings to be used for working capital purposes  an acquisition facility  providing for up to million of borrowings to be used for acquisitions and for capital expenditures and a million insurance letter of credit facility 
the working capital facility and letter of credit facility were scheduled to expire on june  the acquisition facility was also scheduled to convert to a term loan for any outstanding borrowings on june   which balance will be payable in eight equal quarterly principal payments 
at september   million of working capital borrowings and million of acquisition facility borrowings and million of the insurance letters of credit were outstanding 
on december   the heating oil segment entered into a new credit agreement consisting of three facilities totaling million having a maturity date of june  these facilities consist of a million revolving credit facility  the proceeds of which are to be used for working capital purposes  a million revolving credit facility  the proceeds of which are to be used for the issuance of standby letters of credit in connection with surety  worker s compensation and other financial guarantees  and a million revolving credit facility  the proceeds of which are to be used to finance or refinance certain acquisitions and capital expenditures  for the issuance of letters of credit in connection with acquisitions and  to the extent that there is insufficient availability under the working capital facility 
these facilities will refinance and replace the existing credit agreements described in the preceding paragraph  which totaled million 
the partnership s propane segment has a bank credit facility  which consists of a million acquisition facility  a million parity debt facility that can be used to fund maintenance and growth capital expenditures and a million working capital facility 
the working capital facility expires on september  borrowings under the acquisition and parity debt facilities will revolve until september   after which time any outstanding loans thereunder  will amortize in quarterly principal payments with a final payment due on september  at september   million of parity debt facility borrowings  million of acquisition facility borrowings and million of working capital borrowings were outstanding 
the partnership s bank credit facilities and debt agreements contain several financial tests and covenants restricting the various segments and partnership s ability to pay distributions  incur debt and engage in certain other business transactions 
in general these tests are based upon achieving certain debt to cash flow ratios and cash flow to interest expense ratios 
in addition  amounts borrowed under the working capital facilities are subject to a requirement to maintain a zero balance for at least forty five consecutive days 
failure to comply with the various restrictive and affirmative covenants of the partnership s various bank and note facility agreements could negatively impact the partnership s ability to incur additional debt and or pay distributions and could cause certain debt to become currently payable 
as of september   the partnership was in compliance with all debt covenants 

table of contents on february   the partnership and its wholly owned subsidiary  star gas finance company  jointly issued million face value senior notes due on february  these notes accrue interest at an annual rate of and require semi annual interest payments on february and august of each year commencing on august  these notes are redeemable at the option of the partnership  in whole or in part  from time to time by payment of a premium as defined 
these notes were priced at for total gross proceeds of million 
the partnership also incurred million of fees and expenses in connection with the issuance of these notes resulting in net proceeds of million 
the partnership used the proceeds to repay existing long term debt and working capital facility borrowings in the amount of million  million for acquisitions and million to finance capital expenditures 
the partnership has million of debt outstanding as of september  amount does not include working capital borrowings of million  with significant maturities occurring over the next five years 
the following summarizes the partnership s long term debt maturities during fiscal years ending september  exclusive of amounts that have been repaid through september  million million million million million thereafter million the partnership s heating oil segment s bank facilities allow for the refinancing of up to million of existing senior debt and the partnership s propane segment s bank facilities allow for the refinancing of up to million of existing senior debt 
the refinancing capabilities are subject to capacity and other restrictions 
funding for future year s debt maturities other than what could be refinanced with bank facilities will largely be dependent upon new debt or equity issuances 
the partnership continues to evaluate strategic alternatives for its tg e business segment  including evaluating the possible sale of the business 
an investment advisor  bovaro partners  llc  has been hired to assist the partnership in this endeavor 
the partnership has not made a decision to sell the tg e business but is currently evaluating preliminary interest expressed by potential buyers as well as evaluating other alternatives for the business 
a major consideration in the partnership s evaluation process is the significant improvement that tg e demonstrated in fiscal in becoming a more profitable operation 
the partnership would not expect any potential sale to result in a significant gain or loss 
in addition  the partnership would also not expect that any potential sale would have a significant impact on liquidity on a going forward basis 
in general  the partnership distributes to its partners on a quarterly basis  all of its available cash in the manner described in note quarterly distribution of available cash of the consolidated financial statements 
available cash is defined for any of the partnership s fiscal quarters  as all cash on hand at the end of that quarter  less the amount of cash reserves that are necessary or appropriate in the reasonable discretion of the general partner to i provide for the proper conduct of the business  ii comply with applicable law  any of its debt instruments or other agreements  or iii provide funds for distributions to the common unitholders and the senior subordinated unitholders during the next four quarters  in some circumstances 
the partnership believes that the purchase of weather insurance could be an important element in the partnership s ability to maintain the stability of its cash flows 
in august  the partnership purchased weather insurance that could have provided up to million of coverage for the impact of warm weather on the partnership s operating results for the heating season 
no amounts were received under the policies during fiscal due to the colder than normal temperatures 
in addition  the partnership purchased a base of million of weather insurance coverage for each year from and purchased an additional million of weather insurance coverage for fiscal the amount of insurance proceeds that could be realized under these policies is calculated by multiplying a fixed dollar amount by the degree day deviation from an agreed upon cumulative degree day strike price 
for fiscal  the partnership anticipates paying interest of approximately million  and anticipates growth and maintenance capital additions of approximately million 
in addition  the partnership plans to pay distributions on its units to the extent there is sufficient available cash in accordance with the partnership agreement 
the partnership plans to fund acquisitions made through a combination of debt and equity 
based on its current cash position  bank credit availability and anticipated net cash to be generated from operating activities  the partnership expects to be able to meet all of its fiscal obligations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
star gas evaluates its policies and estimates on an on going basis 
the partnership s consolidated financial statements may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions 
the partnership s significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
star gas believes the following are its critical accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in june sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives  such as customer lists  continue to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
the partnership calculates amortization using the straight line method over periods ranging from to years for intangible assets with definite useful lives 
star gas uses amortization methods and determines asset values based on its best estimates using reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
star gas assesses the useful lives of intangible assets based on the estimated period over which star gas will receive benefit from such intangible assets such as historical evidence regarding customer churn rate 
in some cases  the estimated useful lives are based on contractual terms 
at september   the partnership had million of net intangible assets subject to amortization 
if circumstances required a change in estimated useful lives of the assets  it could have a material effect on results of operations 
for example  if lives were shortened by one year  the partnership estimates that amortization for these assets for fiscal would have increased by approximately million 
sfas no 
also requires the partnership s goodwill to be assessed annually for impairment 
these assessments involve management s estimates of future cash flows  market trends and other factors to determine the fair value of the reporting unit  which includes the goodwill to be assessed 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  a loss is recorded in accordance with sfas no 
at september   the partnership had million of goodwill 
intangible assets with finite lives must be assessed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
similar to goodwill  the assessment for impairment requires estimates of future cash flows related to the intangible asset 
to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceeds it future cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded based on the fair value of the asset 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from to years 
net property  plant and equipment was million for the partnership at september  if circumstances required a change in estimated useful lives of the assets  it could have a material effect on results of operations 
for example  if lives were shortened by one year  the partnership estimates that depreciation for fiscal would have increased by approximately million 
assumptions used in the measurement of the partnership s defined benefit obligations sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions requires the partnership to make assumptions as to the expected long term rate of return that could be achieved on defined benefit plan assets and discount rates to determine the present value of the plans pension obligations 
the partnership evaluates these critical assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate enables the partnership to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the rate is required to represent the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the discount rated used for fiscal would have increased pension expense by approximately million and would have increased the minimum pension liability by another million 
the partnership assumed a discount rate of as of september  
table of contents the partnership considers the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets to determine its expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is developed with input from the partnership s actuarial firm 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for fiscals and was percent 
as of september   this assumption was reduced to percent for determining fiscal net periodic pension expense 
a further basis point decrease in the expected return on assets would have increased pension expense in fiscal by approximately million 
over the life of the plans  both gains and losses have been recognized by the plans in the calculation of annual pension expense 
as of september   million of unrecognized losses remain to be recognized by the plans 
these losses may result in increases in future pension expense as they are recognized 
insurance reserves the partnership s heating oil segment has in the past and is currently self insuring a portion of workers compensation  auto and general liability claims 
in february  the propane segment also began self insuring a portion of its workers compensation claims 
the partnership establishes reserves based upon expectations as to what its ultimate liability will be for these claims using developmental factors based upon historical claim experience 
the partnership continually evaluates the potential for changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries 
as of september   the heating oil segment had approximately million of insurance reserves and the propane segment had million of insurance reserves 
the ultimate settlement of these claims could differ materially from the assumptions used to calculate the reserves which could have a material effect on results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its bank credit facilities 
the partnership utilizes these borrowings to meet its working capital needs and also to fund the short term needs of its acquisition program 
at september   the partnership had outstanding borrowings totaling million  of which approximately million is subject to variable interest rates under its bank credit facilities 
the partnership also has interest rate swaps with a notional value of million which swap fixed rate borrowings of to variable rate borrowings based on the six month libor interest rate plus 
in the event that interest rates associated with these facilities were to increase basis points  the impact on future cash flows would be a decrease of approximately million annually 
the partnership also selectively uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risk related to changes in the current and future market price of home heating oil  propane and natural gas 
the value of market sensitive derivative instruments is subject to change as a result of movements in market prices 
consistent with the nature of hedging activity  associated unrealized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the purchase price the partnership would pay for the home heating oil  propane or natural gas being hedged 
sensitivity analysis is a technique used to evaluate the impact of hypothetical market value changes 
based on a hypothetical ten percent increase in the cost of product at september   the potential impact on the partnership s hedging activity would be to increase the fair market value of these outstanding derivatives by million to a fair market value of million  and conversely a hypothetical ten percent decrease in the cost of product would decrease the fair market value of these outstanding derivatives by million to a fair market value of million
