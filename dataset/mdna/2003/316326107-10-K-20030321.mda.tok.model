factors affecting comparability 
our consolidated statements of earnings for include the results of the former operations of vista for the period from august   the acquisition date  through december  and include a full year of operations of chicago title as compared to a partial year in as a result  year over year comparisons may not be meaningful 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we recorded a million  after tax charge  reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  as a result of adopting eitf also  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded certain charges totaling million  after applicable taxes 
these charges relate to the discontinuation of small ticket lease origination at fnf capital and the wholesale international long distance business at micro general 
our consolidated statements of earnings for include the results of operations of chicago title for the period from march   the merger date  through december  in  we reviewed our existing non title operations in connection with the merger and related transition and integration 
as a result  during the first quarter of we recorded certain charges totaling million  after applicable taxes 
these charges primarily relate to the revaluation of non title assets  including our investment in express network  inc  which was sold in the second quarter of  and existing goodwill associated with express network and the write off of obsolete software 

table of contents overview 
the following table presents certain financial data for the years indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands total revenue total expenses net earnings net earnings for the year ended december  were million  or per diluted share as compared with net earnings for the corresponding periods in and of million  or per diluted share and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
revenue 
the following table presents the components of our revenue year ended december  dollars in thousands title insurance premiums escrow and other title related fees real estate related services interest and investment income realized gains and losses  net other income total revenue orders opened by direct operations orders closed by direct operations title insurance revenue is closely related to the level of real estate activity and the average price of real estate sales on both a national and local basis 
real estate sales are directly affected by changes in the cost of financing purchases of real estate ie  mortgage interest rates 
other macroeconomic factors affecting real estate activity include  but are not limited to  demand for housing  employment levels  family income levels and general economic conditions 
because these factors can change dramatically  revenue levels in the title insurance industry can also change dramatically 
for example  beginning in late and into  the level of real estate activity increased  including refinancing transactions  new home sales and resales  due in part to decreases in mortgage interest rates 
stable mortgage interest rates and strength in the real estate market  especially in california and throughout the west coast  contributed to very positive conditions for the title insurance industry throughout and however  during the second half of and through  steady interest rate increases caused by actions taken by the federal reserve board resulted in a significant decline in refinancing transactions 
as a result  the market shifted from a refinance driven market in to a more traditional market driven by new home purchases and resales in and however  beginning in january and continuing through the fourth quarter of  interest rates have been reduced by basis points  bringing interest rates down to their lowest level in recent history  which again has significantly increased the volume of refinance activity 
total revenue in increased  million to  million  an increase of over total revenue in increased  million  or to  million from  million in the increase in total revenue in and is due to increases in real estate and refinance activity as a result of decreasing interest rates 
the inclusion of the chicago title operations for a full year in versus a partial year in also contributed to the increase in revenue in  as compared with further  the increased real estate activity combined with acquisitions of real estate related service companies and the integration of those real estate related service operations into our core businesses in  also contributed to increased revenue in both and 
table of contents title insurance premiums increased to  million in in  title insurance premiums increased to  million from  million in these increases in and are due to increases in resale and refinance activity as a result of the decline in interest rates 
the increase in resale and refinance activity in and has been partially offset by a decrease in the average fee per file 
the decrease in fee per file is consistent with the overall increased level of refinance activity experienced during and the following table presents the percentages of title insurance premiums generated by our direct and agency operations year ended december  amounts amount amount dollars in thousands direct agency total title insurance premiums trends in escrow and other title related fees are primarily related to title insurance activity generated by our direct operations 
escrow and other title related fees during the three year period ended december   fluctuated in a pattern generally consistent with the fluctuation in direct title insurance premiums and order counts 
escrow and other title related fees were million  million and million  respectively  during  and revenues from real estate related services generally trend closely with the level and mix of business  as well as the performance of our title related subsidiaries 
revenues from real estate related services in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in revenue from real estate related services in is primarily the result of increases in revenue from our property appraisal services  real estate tax services  field services  mortgage loan fulfillment services hfn  which was acquired in the second quarter of and collateral risk assessment and valuation services hansen  which was acquired by fnis in the second quarter of in addition  revenue from real estate related services includes million of revenue from the former operations of vista for  as compared with million in the increase in revenues from real estate related services in is primarily the result of increases in revenue from our property appraisal services  real estate tax services  field services  home warranty insurance  property records business idm  which was acquired in the first quarter of  and multiple listing services business risco  which was acquired in the second quarter of in addition  revenues from real estate related services include the revenues of the former operations of vista from the period august   the acquisition date  through december  further  the increase in revenue in is also due to the inclusion of chicago title operations for a full year in versus a partial year in interest and investment income levels are primarily a function of securities markets  interest rates and the amount of cash available for investment 
interest and investment income in was million  compared with million in  a decrease of million  or 
average invested assets  excluding real estate  increased to  million  from  million in the tax equivalent yield in  excluding realized gains and losses was as compared with in and in the decrease in interest and investment income in as compared with  despite the increase in average invested assets  is due to a decrease in interest income reflecting lower interest rates in as compared with interest and investment income increased million  or in to million from million in average invested assets  excluding real estate  increased in from  million in the increase in interest and investment income in from is the result of increased interest and dividend income generated by the increased average invested asset base as a result of the inclusion of chicago title for a full year in versus a partial year in net realized gains and losses for  and were million  million and  respectively 
net realized gains in includes a million gain recognized on our investment in santa 
table of contents barbara restaurant group  inc sbrg common stock as a result of the merger between sbrg and cke restaurants  inc cke and a million gain on the sale of a portion of our cke common stock in the second quarter of net realized gains in were partially offset by other than temporary impairment losses of million on cke recorded during the fourth quarter of and million recorded on mci worldcom bonds in the second quarter of included in net realized gains is an other than temporary impairment loss of million recorded on enron corporation bonds 
other income represents revenue generated by micro general  our majority owned information services subsidiary  which was merged with fnis on july  see recent developments and fnf capital  our equipment leasing subsidiary 
other income was million in  million in and million in the decrease in other income from to is due to the discontinuation in the fourth quarter of of fnf capital s small ticket lease origination business and micro general s wholesale international long distance business 
the decrease in other income from to is primarily due to decreases in externally generated revenue by micro general 
expenses 
the following table presents the components of our expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands personnel costs other operating expenses agent commissions provision for claim losses goodwill amortization interest expense total expenses our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  other operating expenses and agent commissions  which are incurred as orders are received and processed 
title insurance premiums  escrow and other title related fees are generally recognized as income at the time the underlying transaction closes 
as a result  revenue lags approximately days behind expenses and therefore gross margins may fluctuate 
the changes in the market environment  mix of business between direct and agency operations and the contributions from our various business units have impacted margins and net earnings 
we have implemented programs and have taken necessary actions to maintain expense levels consistent with revenue streams 
however  a short time lag does exist in reducing variable costs and certain fixed costs are incurred regardless of revenue levels 
personnel costs include base salaries  commissions and bonuses paid to employees  and are one of our most significant operating expenses 
these costs generally fluctuate with the level of orders opened and closed and with the mix of revenue 
personnel costs totaled  million   million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
personnel costs as a percentage of total revenue have remained relatively consistent over the three year period ended december  those percentages were in  in and in we have taken significant measures to maintain appropriate personnel levels and costs relative to the volume and mix of business while maintaining customer service standards and quality controls 
we will continue to monitor prevailing market conditions and will adjust personnel costs in accordance with activity 
other operating expenses consist primarily of facilities expenses  title plant maintenance  premium taxes which insurance underwriters are required to pay on title premiums in lieu of franchise and other state taxes  postage and courier services  computer services including personnel costs associated with information technology support  professional services  advertising expenses  general insurance  depreciation and trade and notes receivable allowances 
we continue to be committed to cost control measures 
in response to market conditions  we have implemented aggressive cost control programs in order to maintain operating expenses at levels consistent with the levels of revenue 
however  certain fixed costs are incurred regardless of revenue 
table of contents levels  resulting in period over period fluctuations 
our cost control programs are designed to evaluate expenses  both current and budgeted  relative to existing and projected market conditions 
other operating expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue to in from in  and decreased in from in the decrease in other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues in and is attributable to the change in our cost structure as a result of the addition of the chicago title operations  which are primarily title and real estate related 
other operating expenses totaled  million  million and million in  and  respectively 
agent commissions represent the portion of premiums retained by agents pursuant to the terms of their respective agency contracts 
agent commissions and the resulting percentage of agent premiums we retain vary according to regional differences in real estate closing practices and state regulations 
the following table illustrates the relationship of agent premiums and agent commissions year ended december  amount amount amount dollars in thousands agent premiums agent commissions premiums we retain the provision for claim losses includes an estimate of anticipated title claims and escrow losses 
the estimate of anticipated title and title related claims is accrued as a percentage of title premium revenue based on our historical loss experience and other relevant factors 
we monitor our claims loss experience on a continual basis and adjust the provision for claim losses accordingly 
we believe that as a result of our underwriting and claims handling practices  as well as the refinancing business of the current and prior years  we will maintain the claim loss trends we have experienced over the past several years 
as such  our claim loss provision as a percentage of total title premiums was in  and a summary of the reserve for claim losses follows year ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance reserves assumed claim loss provision related to current year prior years total claim loss provision claims paid  net of recoupments related to current year prior years total claims paid  net of recoupments ending balance provision for claim losses as a percentage of title insurance premiums in connection with the chicago title merger on march   we assumed chicago title s then outstanding reserve for claim losses 
the favorable development on prior years loss reserves during  and was attributable to lower than expected payment levels on recent issue years  which included periods of increased resale activity as well as a high proportion of refinance business 
as a result  title policies issued in prior years have been 
table of contents replaced by the more recently issued policies  therefore generally terminating much of the loss exposure on the previously issued policies 
interest expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in is attributable to the decrease in outstanding notes payable and the decline in interest rates 
the decrease in interest expense in as compared with is due to a decrease in outstanding notes payable  primarily as a result of using proceeds from our common stock offering in january and our public offering of notes in august to pay down amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
also included in interest expense in is the write off of million of debt issuance costs associated with paying down our credit facility 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 we did not record goodwill amortization in see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill amortization was million in and million in the increase in as compared with is primarily due to the acquisition of idm and risco and the inclusion of a full year of amortization in compared with a partial year in related to the chicago title merger 
also  goodwill amortization in includes an million pretax write off associated with the discontinuance of two businesses in the fourth quarter of income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before income taxes for  and was  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before income taxes is attributable to our estimate of ultimate income tax liability  and the characteristics of net earnings ie  operating income versus investment income  as well as the elimination of goodwill amortization consistent with sfas no 
minority interest for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in minority interest in and is primarily attributable to increased earnings of our majority owned subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
our cash requirements include debt service  operating expenses  taxes  capital expenditures  systems development  treasury stock repurchases  lease securitizations  business acquisitions and dividends on our common stock 
we believe that all anticipated cash requirements for current operations will be met from internally generated funds  through cash dividends from subsidiaries  cash generated by investment securities and bank borrowings through public debt offerings and existing credit facilities 
our short and long term liquidity requirements are monitored regularly to match cash inflows with cash requirements 
we forecast the daily needs of all of our subsidiaries and periodically review their short and long term projected sources and uses of funds  as well as the asset  liability  investment and cash flow assumptions underlying these projections 
our two significant sources of internally generated funds are dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries 
as a holding company  we receive cash from our subsidiaries in the form of dividends and as reimbursement for operating and other administrative expenses we incur 
the reimbursements are executed within the guidelines of management agreements among us and our subsidiaries 
our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by state regulation in their ability to pay dividends and make distributions 
each state of domicile regulates the extent to which our title underwriters can pay dividends or make other distributions to us 
during  our title insurance subsidiaries can pay dividends or make other distributions to us of million 
our underwritten title companies  real estate related service companies and fnis  collect revenue and pay operating expenses 
however  they are not regulated to the same extent as our insurance subsidiaries 
positive cash flow from these subsidiaries is invested primarily in cash and cash equivalents 
seasonality 
historically  real estate transactions have produced seasonal revenue levels for title insurers 
the first calendar quarter is typically the weakest quarter in terms of revenue due to the generally low volume of home sales during january and february 
the fourth calendar quarter is typically the strongest in terms of revenue due to commercial entities desiring to complete transactions by year end 
significant changes in interest rates may alter these traditional seasonal patterns due to the effect the cost of financing has on the volume of real estate transactions 

table of contents financing 
in connection with the chicago title merger  we entered into a syndicated credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for three distinct credit facilities million  month revolving credit facility due september   which was repaid and terminated on january   million  year revolving credit facility due march   and million term loan facility with a year amortization period  due march  the credit agreement bears interest at a variable rate of interest based on the debt ratings assigned to us by certain independent agencies  and is unsecured 
in may  the interest rate was reduced to libor plus from libor plus as a result of an upgrade in our debt ratings 
amounts borrowed under the credit agreement were used to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration  to refinance previously existing indebtedness  to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger and to fund other general corporate purposes 
as of december   million was outstanding under our credit agreement and we have million in borrowings available to us 
the credit agreement and other debt facilities impose certain affirmative and negative covenants on us relating to current debt ratings  certain financial ratios related to liquidity  net worth  capitalization  investments  acquisitions and restricted payments  and certain dividend restrictions

as of december   our required annual payments relating to these contractual obligations are as follows thereafter total dollars in thousands notes payable operating lease payments purchase obligations for business acquisitions total capital stock transactions

the remainder of the cash proceeds are available for general corporate purposes 
on april   our board of directors authorized us to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
purchases may be made by us from time to time in the open market or in block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions depending on market conditions and other factors 
as part of this program  
table of contents we have repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for million  at an average purchase price of per share 
in may  we retired those  shares held as treasury stock 
on april   our board of directors approved a three year stock repurchase program  whereby we will devote a portion of our annual cash flow from operations to the systematic repurchase of shares of our common stock

the amount repurchased includes  shares of common stock purchased from certain of our officers and directors during the third quarter of  of which  shares were accepted as full payment of notes receivable  including accrued interest 
see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  we retired  of these shares held as treasury stock  totaling million 
through march   a total of  shares of common stock has been repurchased for million  or an average price of 
additional minimum pension liability adjustment 
discount rates that are used in determining our december  projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension costs were based on prevailing interest rates as of december  similar to prior years  we looked at the moody s aa corporate bond index at that date as an appropriate basis in determining the discount rate 
a decrease in the discount rate used at december  resulted in an additional minimum pension liability adjustment 
as such  we recorded a net of tax charge of million to accumulated other comprehensive earnings in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
equity investments 
our equity investments are in public companies whose security prices are subject to significant volatility 
the fair value of certain of these investments is less than our cost basis as of december  we currently believe these declines in fair value to be temporary based on the relatively short time these investments cost bases have exceeded their fair value and the financial condition and near term prospects of these companies 
however  should the fair value of these investments remain below our cost bases and or the financial condition or prospects of these companies deteriorate  we may determine in a future period that this decline in fair value is other than temporary  requiring that an impairment loss be recognized in the period such a determination is made 
merger of cke restaurants  inc cke and santa barbara restaurant group  inc sbrg 
on march   a merger between cke and sbrg was consummated  whereby sbrg became a wholly owned subsidiary of cke 
as a result of the merger  holders of sbrg common stock received 
shares of cke common stock for each whole share of sbrg common stock

in addition  our vice chairman of the board of directors also serves on the board of directors of both cke and sbrg 
as a result of the merger  our shares of sbrg common stock were converted into common shares of cke and we recognized a million gain 
in addition  during the second quarter of we recorded a million gain on the sale of a portion of our cke common stock 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on our cke investment 
our investment in cke had a cost basis of million and a fair value of million as of december  critical accounting policies 
the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
see note a of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of our significant accounting policies that have been followed in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition 
our direct title insurance premiums and escrow and other title related fees are recognized as revenue at the time of closing of the related transaction as the earnings process is considered complete 
our agency title insurance premiums are recognized as revenue when policies are reported to us and are recorded as revenue on a gross basis before the deduction of agent commissions 
we accrue for unreported agency title insurance premiums based on historical reporting patterns of our agents and current trends 
we recognize real estate related services and other income over the period the related services are provided 
investments 
our fixed maturities available for sale and our equity securities available for sale are recorded at fair value 
our other long term investments are carried at cost  market or on the equity method  as appropriate 
our short term investments are carried at amortized cost  which approximates market 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on the basis of the cost of the specific investments sold and are credited or charged to income on a trade date basis 
unrealized gains or losses on fixed maturity and equity securities that are classified as available for sale  net of applicable deferred income taxes benefits  are excluded from earnings and credited or charged directly to a separate component of stockholders equity 
if any unrealized losses on fixed maturity or equity securities are deemed other than temporary  such unrealized losses are recognized as realized losses 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have made acquisitions in the past that resulted in recording a significant amount of goodwill 
as of december   goodwill was million  of which the majority relates to goodwill recorded in connection with the chicago title merger in through december   in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  goodwill has been amortized on a straight line basis over to years and has been tested for impairment on a continual basis based on the undiscounted cash flows generated by the underlying assets 
in  we did not record goodwill amortization as a result of adopting sfas no 
as required by sfas no 
 we performed an annual goodwill impairment test on our reporting units and have determined that each of our reporting units has a fair value in excess of our carrying value 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment has been recorded 
see note a of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
reserve for claim losses 
our reserve for claim losses includes known claims as well as losses we expect to incur  net of recoupments 
each known claim is reserved based on our review as to the estimated amount of the claim and the costs required to settle the claim 
reserves for claims that are incurred but not reported are established at the time premium revenue is recognized based on historical loss experience and other factors  including industry averages  claim loss history  current legal environment  geographic considerations and type of policy written 
the reserve for claim losses also includes reserves for losses arising from the escrow  closing and disbursement functions due to fraud or operational error 
if a loss is related to a policy issued by an independent agent  we may proceed against the independent agent pursuant to the terms of the agency agreement 
in any event  we may proceed against third parties who are responsible for any loss under the title insurance policy under rights of subrogation 
see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements 
escrow accounts 
in conducting our operations  we routinely hold customers assets in escrow  pending completion of real estate transactions 
certain of these amounts are maintained in segregated bank accounts and have not been included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we have a contingent liability relating to proper disposition of these balances for our customers which amounted to billion at december  as a result of holding these customers assets in escrow  we have ongoing programs for realizing economic benefits during the year through favorable borrowing and vendor arrangements with various banks 
there were no investments or loans outstanding as of december  related to these arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements 
during the second quarter of  we adopted emerging issues task force no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  eitf 
eitf sets forth the rules for recognizing interest income on all credit sensitive mortgage and asset backed securities and certain prepay 
table of contents ment sensitive securities including agency interest only strips  whether purchased or retained in securitization  and determining when these securities must be written down to fair value because of impairment 
adoption of eitf requires the valuation of residual interests in securitizations to be recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the residual interests through a charge to earnings when any portion of the decline in fair value is attributable to an impairment loss  rather than an unrealized loss in stockholders equity 
as such  we recorded a charge of million  net of income tax benefit of million  in the second quarter of in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method 
the statement further requires separate recognition of intangible assets that meet one of two criteria 
the statement applies to all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires that an intangible asset that is acquired shall be initially recognized and measured based on its fair value 
the statement also provides that goodwill should not be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
sfas no 
is generally effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  and the amortization provisions of sfas no 
are effective for acquisitions subsequent to june  beginning in  we did not record goodwill amortization 
as required by sfas no 
 we performed an annual goodwill impairment test on our reporting units and have determined that each of our reporting units has a fair value in excess of our carrying value  therefore no goodwill impairment has been recorded 
see note a of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas no 
which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas no 
supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  sfas no 

this standard is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others fin  an interpretation of financial accounting standards board statements nos 
 and and a rescission of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
fin also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ended after december  see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 

this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
this statement also amends the disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standard no 
and accounting principles board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the 
table of contents method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements 
we will implement statement of financial accounting standard no 
effective january  regarding disclosure requirements for condensed financial statements for interim periods 
we have not yet determined whether we will voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
during  the fasb emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf provides an accounting model for an approach to determine whether a vendor should divide an arrangement with multiple deliverables into separate units of accounting 
eitf requires an analysis of whether a delivered item has stand alone value to the customer  whether there is subjective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items  and whether delivery of the undelivered items is probable and substantially in control of the vendor if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item 
companies are required to adopt eitf for fiscal periods beginning after june  companies may apply eitf prospectively to new arrangements initiated after the date of adoption or as a cumulative effect adjustment 
we are currently evaluating the impact of eitf item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks 
see business investment policies and investment portfolio and notes c and g of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with our financial activities as of our year ended december  interest rate risk our fixed maturity investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
equity price risk the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information below  since actual results could differ materially because the information was developed using estimates and assumptions as described below  and because our reserve for claim losses representing of total liabilities is not included in the hypothetical effects 
the hypothetical effects of changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of financial instruments would have been as follows as of december  a 
an approximate million net increase decrease in the fair value of fixed maturity securities would have occurred if interest rates had decreased increased by basis points 
the change in fair values was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models  primarily duration modeling 
b 
an approximate million net increase decrease in the fair value of equity securities would have occurred if there was a price increase decrease in market prices 

table of contents c 
it is not anticipated that there would be a significant change in the fair value of other long term investments or short term investments if there was a change in market conditions  based on the nature and duration of the financial instruments involved 
d 
interest expense on average debt outstanding would have increased decreased approximately million  if interest rates increased decreased basis points
