riggs national corporation for a better understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three years  you are advised that you should read all of the following discussion and analysis and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are subject to risk  uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results  performance  prospects or opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
overview riggs national corporation is a bank holding company headquartered in washington  dc the company engages in a variety of banking and financial services including community  commercial and international banking  trust and investment management services and venture capital investing 
we conduct our activities through six reportable segments banking  international banking  riggs co 
wealth management  treasury  riggs capital partners venture capital and other 
with the exception of venture capital investing  the activities of the company are conducted through its principal operating subsidiary  riggs bank  and its subsidiaries and divisions 
venture capital investing is performed through two subsidiaries of the company  riggs capital partners and riggs capital partners ii 
we have branch locations and atms in the metropolitan washington  dc area and a bank in the united kingdom 
we have additional operations or subsidiaries in london england  miami florida  berlin germany  jersey channel islands and nassau bahamas 
we serve an array of customers including individuals  partnerships  corporations  foundations  not for profit organizations and foreign embassies and delegations 
the company faces significant competitive pressure from local  regional  national and international banking institutions as well as thrifts  finance companies  credit unions  brokerage and insurance companies and other financial intermediaries 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we have 
we compete on the basis of our reputation  localized decision making  interest rates  convenient locations  hours of operation and quality of customer service 
the company also is affected by prevailing economic conditions  including federal monetary and fiscal policies  federal regulation of financial institutions and the perceptions of customers regarding stability of financial markets and the financial services industry 
these factors also affect the operations of all of the company s segments 
the international banking segment also is affected by the political  social and economic environments in those countries in which it does business 
while we strive to monitor and minimize risk  the company does in fact fund customers that have alternative  and in some instances competing  goals and strategies 
these competitive frictions may have future negative consequences to the company 
in addition  the company s international presence exposes it to various political risks and the further risk that the general public may look unfavorably upon some of its foreign customer relationships see business competition and environment and financial position and liquidity cross border outstandings 
in december  the company announced plans to implement a series of actions intended to enhance its financial performance and customer service and better position it for the current and long term economic environment 
this effort to enhance performance and service project eps consists of a technology initiative  a re design of operational processes and a realignment of our european operations to focus on private banking and embassy banking 
we intend to standardize and upgrade our technology systems and infrastructure  which will enable us to both operate more efficiently and provide better service to our customers 
during we have selected a new core systems vendor  designed a new  more efficient infrastructure  introduced new services  identified ways to improve efficiency and sold rbel s commercial and trade finance loans 
the technology upgrade is expected to be substantially completed in the second half of our year end results were adversely impacted by restructuring and other charges amounting to million see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
of this amount  million was included in noninterest expense  with million recorded in applicable income tax expense 
during  project eps continued to adversely impact noninterest expense by a total of million which included additional impairment and other charges 
through the implementation of our restructuring plan announced in  we were able to eliminate many of the anticipated employee positions such that our workforce dropped from  full time equivalent positions at december  to  at december  for the year ended december   the company had net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in our results were adversely impacted by restructuring and other charges  as noted previously 
return on average assets was 
in compared to in and return on average equity was in compared to in during  the company generated modest improvements over the prior year in noninterest income  net interest income and asset quality  as well as a reduction in losses related to venture capital investments 
excluding special charges in  noninterest expense in was slightly higher than in the previous year as a result of higher pension and other employee benefit related expenses and increased project expense related to the project eps initiative 
net interest income after provision for loan losses increased million  or from the prior year 
noninterest income increased by million  or in compared to due principally to venture capital investment losses that were lower by million 
noninterest expense decreased by million  or from the prior year due primarily to the previously mentioned million in restructuring and other charges that were taken in excluding these charges  noninterest expense increased by approximately million  or from  primarily due to increases in other employee benefit expenses of million  consulting expenses of million  and credit card processing charges of million 
included in other noninterest expense for were impairment charges of million on a property at our london operations and million on a technology contract 
in addition  we recorded million to exit long term maintenance contracts  also in london 
the provision for loan losses was thousand  a million or decrease from nonperforming assets at december  were thousand compared to million at december  riggs remains a well capitalized institution which currently has minimal nonperforming assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates management has prepared the consolidated financial statements included in this form k in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america applied on a consistent basis and which follow general practice within the banking industry 
accordingly  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes to be reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net interest income and expense during the periods presented 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes involve estimates  judgments and assumptions that are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from estimates  judgments and assumptions we use in applying these critical accounting policies 
reserve for loan losses the reserve for loan losses is maintained at a level that we believe adequate to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses is based upon an on going  analytical review of the loan portfolio 
this analysis requires application of judgment  evaluation of economic uncertainties and assessment of business conditions that may change 
because of these and other factors  adjustments to the reserve for loan losses may be required 
the analytical review of the loan portfolio performed to determine the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses includes a review of loans with balances over thousand for impairment  an analysis of historical loss experience by loan type and  for groups of loans with similar characteristics  an evaluation of current economic conditions and all other factors we consider pertinent to the analysis 
impaired loans are defined as specifically reviewed loans for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the loan agreement 
impaired loans are generally commercial and financial loans and commercial real estate loans and are usually on non accrual status 
each impaired loan with an outstanding balance equal to or greater than thousand has a specific  identified loan loss reserve associated with it 
impaired loans do not include large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans with similar collateral characteristics  such as residential mortgage and home equity loans 
loss reserves for these types of loans are established on an aggregate basis using historical loss experience 
balances related to impaired loans for which there are specific reserves are excluded when applying historical loss ratios to determine loan loss reserves 
the specific reserves for impaired loans are included in the reserve for loan losses 
impaired loans are valued based upon the fair value of the related collateral if the loans are collateral dependent 
for all other impaired loans  the specific reserves are based on the present values of expected cash flows discounted at each loan s initial effective interest rate 
provisions to the reserve for loan losses are charged against  or credited to  earnings in amounts necessary to maintain an adequate reserve for loan losses 
commercial loans are charged off when it is determined that they cannot be fully recovered and non commercial loans are generally charged off or loan foreclosure proceedings begun upon becoming days delinquent or at such time as permitted by law or other regulations 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the reserve for loan losses 
the company maintains its reserve for loan losses in accordance with a policy approved by the board of directors 
the company has an established methodology for analyzing its reserve for loan losses that includes an internal loan classification policy 
the company periodically reviews its methodology to ascertain that it produces accurate assessments of probable loan losses 
domestic and international loans are subjected to similar review procedures 
while the company believes its credit monitoring procedures are adequate  credit losses are  however  inherent to our business  and it is possible there may be unidentified losses in the loan portfolio at december  that may become apparent at a later date pursuant to our analysis or pursuant to comment following regulatory examination 
the establishment of loan loss reserves for problem credits that are currently unidentified or unanticipated would negatively impact future earnings 
a charge  if any is needed  would generally be recorded in the segment in which the loan is recorded 
venture capital investments venture capital investments are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses included in noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations 
at december   the company valued its venture capital portfolio at million 
this valuation was arrived at using a variety of factors including  but not limited to market prices  where available  and discounted  if necessary  to reflect trading history  lock up provisions  lack of market liquidity and other factors  cost  if there is no readily determinable market price and there has not been a material event  such as a follow on round of financing or strategic sale  a value higher than cost if indicated by additional financing which fulfills certain requirements  and analysis and commentary from a fund s investment manager general partner 
since the company has no present intention to sell or liquidate the venture capital portfolio  the valuation of venture capital investments is subject to uncertainties in that it does not represent a negotiated value between the company  as seller  and an independent  willing buyer that has the necessary knowledge and financial ability to complete the purchase 
additionally  if the company attempted to sell its venture capital portfolio  particularly if we deemed it necessary to liquidate our investment within a short period of time  the actual proceeds from the sale could differ significantly from our carrying value 
we note that the market for the type of venture capital investments we hold has been impacted by a slowing economy  a depressed domestic equity market in which the values of publicly traded technology companies have declined drastically  and  because of these market conditions  a decline in the number of initial public offerings and acquisitions of private companies by publicly traded firms 
although these and other factors have been assessed in determining current values  because of the subjectivity in determining values  it is possible that the company would experience a material loss if it chose to liquidate its venture capital portfolio  particularly if it attempted to do so quickly 
the loss  if any  would be recorded in the riggs capital partners segment 
deferred tax assets on venture capital losses we record a provision for income taxes based upon the amounts of current taxes payable or refundable and the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes that will reverse in future periods 
when substantial uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset  the carrying value of the asset is reduced by a valuation allowance 
establishing a valuation allowance results in an increase in income tax expense 
unrealized losses in our venture capital operations have resulted in the establishment of million of deferred tax assets as of december  of this amount  million of these assets was established in these assets can be utilized to reduce taxes payable on future capital gains but must be utilized within five years of the year in which the loss is realized for tax return purposes 
because of continuing losses in our venture capital portfolio and the lack of current suitability of alternatives to generate capital gains  riggs has established a valuation allowance of million against the deferred tax asset at december  of the million  million was established in the company believes that the unreserved deferred tax asset balance of million at december   which includes a deferred tax asset related to realized losses of million  will be realized through generation of future net capital gains within its venture capital operations or the implementation of alternative business strategies that generate net capital gains 
management has identified several alternative business strategies that we expect could produce sufficient capital gains to allow the deferred tax asset balance to be realized 
if sufficient net capital gains within the company s venture capital operations are not realized in a timely manner  or if business conditions or other factors make it impossible  impractical or imprudent to implement the identified alternative strategies  an additional valuation allowance  resulting in a charge against income  for that portion of the deferred tax asset which will not be utilized  will be recorded in the other segment 
impairment of long lived assets the company tests for impairment in the carrying value of any asset or group of assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million write down to the carrying value of a london facility that is currently being marketed for sale 
this write down was taken to align the carrying value to the estimated net realizable value 
in the company recorded an million charge related to a long term  fixed price  non cancelable project contract due to cost overruns that could not be passed on to subcontractors or other parties to the contract 
this contract involves the construction  implementation and maintenance of a computer system to be utilized by the federal government in its cash management and reporting 
the contract continues to have significant uncertainties as to the costs to complete the contract and revenues resulting from the contract 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional million impairment charge in the banking segment due to additional system requirements 
this additional impairment charge was determined by discounting the probability weighted estimated future cash flows 
we are continuing to negotiate with the contractual counterparty to limit the scope of the project and for additional funding 
since the recoverability of future costs may be dependent upon the willingness of the contractual counterparty to fund future costs  there may be additional impairment associated with this contract 
the amount of such losses  if any  cannot be estimated at this time 
at december   the company has an asset of million related to this contract 
results of operations net interest income the difference between interest income and interest expense is net interest income 
net interest income is the company s largest revenue source representing  and of all revenues in  and  respectively 
net interest income is affected by changes in the level of interest rates and the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
while the company can impact net interest income through its product pricing and promotional decisions  many factors  such as the overall condition of the economy  monetary policy  tax laws  credit demand and competition place the outcome of net interest income beyond the control of the company see tables a and b of this form k 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was million in  a million or increase from net interest income of million 
net interest income increased primarily because of a larger decrease in interest expense from million to million than in interest income from million to million 
decreases in general levels of interest rates were the major contributors to the declines in both interest income and interest expense 
in the federal reserve decreased its federal funds target rate from basis points to basis points and in it decreased its federal funds target rate from basis points to basis points 
as interest rates decreased in  the company found it increasingly difficult to pass on these decreases to its deposit customers due to market forces even though volume increased as customers sought to place their money in more secure  insured fixed income products 
in contrast  loans and other assets have repriced more quickly 
the increase in net interest income in on a taxable equivalent basis was thousand compared to net interest income of million 
net interest margin  or net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis divided by average earning assets  was in compared to and in and  respectively 
the margin was reduced from to as the basis point decrease in general levels of interest rates combined with the increase in average earning assets of million to lower the ratio 
the amount of deposits that the us government and its agencies place on deposit at riggs bank was a significant reason for the margin decline 
at december   those deposits totaled billion 
because these deposits have a lower spread relationship than that obtainable in the general marketplace  the more kept on deposit at riggs bank by these entities  the lower margin riggs bank is generally able to achieve 
conversely  the lower the amount of deposits that these institutions keep on deposit with us  generally  the higher the margin we attain 
these deposits have a lower spread relationship since they must be collateralized by government securities  which generally yield less than loans of comparable maturities 
interest income on a tax equivalent basis in was million  a decline of million  or  from million in as shown in table b of this form k  most of the decrease is attributable to a decline in market interest rates which had already contributed to the million decrease from to in  interest income declined in loans  time deposits with other banks  and federal funds sold and repurchase agreements  increasing only in securities available for sale as a result of an increase in volume 
average earning assets in increased by million from average loan balances decreased by million in compared to primarily as a result of the million decrease in average foreign loans 
over the past year we have realigned our rbel operations to focus on expatriate and embassy banking rather than corporate lending 
consequently  we sold million in loans and loan commitments at rbel in more than offsetting the decline in average loans was an increase in average securities available for sale of million 
the average rate earned on all earning assets in was  a decline of from the prior year 
average earning assets in declined by million from average loan balances decreased by million in compared to approximately of this decrease in average loans was attributable to the company s decision in to exit from its out of market syndicated loan portfolio and an additional is attributable to the de emphasis on the commercial lending function in london 
decreases in the average loan portfolio were partially offset by a million increase in average securities available for sale and a million increase in average time deposits  federal funds sold and reverse repurchase agreement balances 
the average rate earned on all earning assets was  a basis point decline from the company s decision in to exit from the syndicated loan market was made to reduce the overall credit exposure in the portfolio and to concentrate on those customers with a higher potential for using multiple banking relationships 
we have no current plans to participate in the syndicated loan market in the company anticipated that the decline in average earning assets and loans in could continue into and initiated measures to strengthen its lending function 
the company s ability to increase its loan portfolio is usually dependent  however  upon many factors including the general state of the economy and the ability to price loans so as to adequately compensate the company for the additional risk undertaken 
in addition  loan and other earning asset growth is constrained by the requirement that the company and the bank maintain certain capital ratios see table n of this form k and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
because the loan portfolio continued to decline in  we purchased million of residential mortgage loans at a premium of million 
the company also increased its overall balance of average earning assets through the million increase in average securities discussed previously 
return on average assets was 
for the year ended december   compared to 
for the same period a year ago 
return on average shareholders equity was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in both of these ratios improved in because of the previously noted restructuring and other charges recorded in the composition of average earning assets for the past three years is as follows total loans securities available for sale time deposits with other banks federal funds sold reverse repurchase agreements the decrease in average loans over the past three years reflects our decisions to decrease our exposure in both the syndicated loan business and commercial lending in london 
the decreases in loans have been offset by increases in our securities available for sale portfolio 
interest expense decreased by million from to all of this decrease was due to declining rates  partially offset by a million increase in interest bearing funds 
the average cost of all interest bearing funds decreased to in from in interest expense declined in all categories of deposits  foreign and domestic  as well as in repurchase agreements and other short term borrowings 
interest expense on long term debt increased slightly 
in  average interest bearing deposit balances increased by million  or from the average cost of interest bearing deposits was in compared to in interest expense decreased by million from to approximately of this decrease was due to declining rates and the balance was due to a million  or decrease in average interest bearing funds 
the average cost of all interest bearing funds decreased to in from in the composition of average interest bearing liabilities for the past three years is as follow interest bearing deposits federal funds purchased repurchase agreements other short term borrowings long term debt provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses in was thousand compared to million in  a decrease of million 
this compares to a provision for loan losses in of million  representing a million difference from the million provision taken in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and critical accounting policies and estimates reserve for loan losses 
noninterest income excluding net securities gains  noninterest income increased by million  or in from including net securities gains  noninterest income increased by million  or from the prior year 
the increase in noninterest income was primarily attributable to a million decrease in the value of the company s venture capital investments in compared to a million decrease in the prior year 
also contributing to the increase was a million increase in service charges and fee income 
partially offsetting these improvements was a million  or decrease in trust and investment advisory income  primarily due to a decrease in the value of assets under management  along with numerous other complex factors  and a million decrease in net securities gains 
noninterest income represented of the company s total revenue  which is comprised of net interest income plus noninterest income 
securities gains were million and million in and  respectively 
the securities gains in were recorded in conjunction with the company s shortening of the duration of its portfolio 
substantially all of the prior year s securities gains were attributable to the sale of concord efs  inc  a company in which we had an equity investment for many years 
as noted previously  the year to year decline in trust and investment advisory income was the result of lower market value of assets under management which decreased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  another factor impacting this business activity was the general uncertainty concerning the performance of the stock market 
new and existing clients were more inclined to seek less volatile investments  such as fixed income products  which typically have lower fee schedules than equity products 
the decline in trust and investment advisory income also was adversely impacted by the second quarter renegotiation of a year agreement with the real estate advisor to the multi employer property trust mept  an open commingled real estate fund 
this advisor now will perform all asset management services for the fund  but we will continue to act as trustee  investment manager and custodian  and will provide portfolio level financial and valuation reporting 
the new agreement  which became effective july   resulted in a reduction in revenue of approximately million from the annualized impact is expected to be approximately million 
trust and investment advisory income impacts the riggs co 
segment while venture capital losses impact the riggs capital partners segment 
securities gains impact the treasury segment 
service charges and fee income primarily impacts the banking segment 
excluding net securities gains  noninterest income decreased by million  or in from including net securities gains  noninterest income decreased by million  or from the prior year 
the decrease in noninterest income was primarily attributable to a million loss in the value of the company s venture capital investments in compared to a gain of million in the prior year 
also contributing to the decrease was a million decrease in trust and investment advisory income that was due principally to a decline in the value of assets under management 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million  or increase in service charges and fees and an million increase in net securities gains 
as noted previously  substantially all of the securities gains were attributable to the merger of and subsequent sale of stock in a company in which we had an equity investment for many years 
noninterest income represented of the company s total revenue in noninterest expense noninterest expense decreased by million  or  to million in compared to million in approximately million of this decrease is attributable to the restructuring and other charges that we recorded in as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding those special charges  noninterest expense increased million from year to year 
this increase was primarily due to increased consulting expenses of million related to the project eps initiative  higher pension and other employee benefit costs  as well as several impairment charges 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in salaries and wages  of which approximately million is attributable to a charge taken in to terminate an employment contract 
in we increased our matching of employee k plan contributions from for every dollar contributed up to of eligible wages to a dollar for dollar match up to of eligible wages 
this change in matching resulted in an increase in pension and other employee benefits expense of million in compared to pension and other employee benefits costs affect all segments with the exception of riggs capital partners 
in july  the company awarded  shares of its common stock to certain key executives under the terms of a plan approved by shareholders in april this award will vest in equal amounts through december for the year ended  we recorded thousand of expense related to this award which is recorded in pension and other employee benefits in the consolidated statements of operations 
we anticipate recording approximately million of expense in each of the next four calendar years 
to obtain this award  however  the individual to whom it was granted must be employed by the company on the date of distribution each year 
projected expense amounts  therefore  could vary 
during we recorded several impairment charges amounting to million 
first  as part of our overall technology upgrade  we wrote off million in costs related to prior development of an information system to support bank tellers  which will not be compatible with our future technology 
we wrote down a property in london in the amount of million after we determined that its value was impaired due to a depressed real estate market 
that amount was determined after consultation with real estate experts 
in london  we also incurred a charge of million to exit long term maintenance contracts 
domestically  we wrote down a long term  fixed price  non cancelable technology contract by million due to cost overruns that probably will not be passed on to subcontractors or other parties to the contract 
we periodically perform strategic reviews of our business operations including  but not limited to  operating segments  sub segments  products  delivery channels and back office operations to ensure that levels of performance are adequate or can be modified in such a way and within a reasonable timeframe so as to meet expected requirements 
if it is determined that our requirements cannot be met in a satisfactory way and timeframe  we may sell  wind down  abandon or take any other measures deemed necessary and prudent for the long term benefit of the company 
noninterest expense increased by million  or to million in compared to million in approximately million of this increase  or is attributable to the restructuring and other charges described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other significant changes from the prior year include an additional million or increase in salaries and wages  a million increase in pension and other employee benefits that is primarily attributable to a million increase in the actuarially determined domestic pension plan expense and a million increase in consultants and outsourcing fees  which is primarily due to increased management fees related to an additional venture capital partnership 
decreases in advertising and public relations expense of million partially offset these increases 
in  the company reduced its workforce by  from  full time equivalent positions at december  to  at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december  we employed  full time equivalent employees 
financial position and liquidity earning assets loans  securities available for sale and other short term investments are the company s primary earning assets 
at december   and  these assets represented approximately  and of the company s total assets and  and of the company s average assets for those years  respectively 
loans represent the largest earning asset category 
at december   and  loans were  and of earning assets and  and of average earning assets for those years  respectively 
the decreases in these ratios reflect our strategy over this time period to exit the syndicated loan business and continued de emphasis of commercial lending at rbel  as well as growth in the securities portfolio to secure the additional us government agency deposits 
securities available for sale  the next largest component of earning assets  were  and of earning assets at december   and  respectively  and represented  and of average earning assets for those years 
the third component of the company s earning assets mix  short term investments  was  and of earning assets at december   and  respectively  and represented  and of average earning assets for the those years 
loans loans are generated in the banking segment through both retail and commercial banking activities and in the international banking segment through embassy banking and rbel see tables c and d of this form k 
total loans at december  were billion  a million  or increase from december  the largest increase occurred in commercial and financial  and commercial real estate loans  which increased million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in foreign loans  as we continue to de emphasize commercial lending at rbel 
as part of this strategy  we sold million in loans and loan commitments at rbel in total loans at december  were billion  a million  or decrease from december  that decrease was due in part to the company s decision to limit its exposure on syndicated loans 
approximately million of the decrease was attributable to this business strategy 
at december   and  less than of loans were held pending sale 
see table i of this form k for the distribution of year end loans 
cross border outstandings we extend credit to borrowers domiciled outside of the united states primarily through our international banking segment 
cross border outstandings include loans  acceptances  interest bearing deposits with other banks  investments and other monetary assets 
in addition  cross border outstandings include guarantees issued on behalf of non local third parties and local currency outstandings to the extent they are not funded by local currency borrowings 
while we routinely review these assets  monitor the international economic climate and assess the impact of any changes on foreign domiciled borrowers  the economic value and recoverability of these assets may be affected by changing economic and political conditions in the respective countries 
in addition  some of our loans are to sovereign entities  some of which might be subject to deteriorating economic conditions  political and social upheaval  currency depreciation or devaluation  as well as nationalization or expropriation of assets or other factors over which we have no control 
if  for any reason  a loan to such a borrower became past due or a problem credit  collection efforts would be made more difficult because of the sovereign status of the borrower 
several sovereign entities also maintain significant depository relationships with the company 
the simultaneous withdrawal of funds by several of these depositors could in the short term negatively impact our liquidity position see business competition and environment 
at december   we had no cross border outstandings exceeding of our total assets to countries experiencing difficulties in repaying their external debt 
at december   we had no loans in either a nonperforming  past due or potential problem loan status to a country with cross border outstandings in excess of of our total assets 
at december  and  the united kingdom was the only foreign country with cross border outstandings in excess of of our total assets that had loans in either a nonperforming  past due or potential problem loan status see tables e and f of this form k and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
short term investments short term investments are managed in our treasury segment and include time deposits with other banks  federal funds sold and reverse repurchase agreements 
these investments are liquid assets with original maturities generally of less than days 
short term investments are generally lower yielding assets that are highly interest rate sensitive 
the amount of funds available for short term investments is a function of daily movements in our securities  loan and deposit portfolios  combined with our overall interest rate risk management strategy 
liquidity also is available through credit facilities with the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb 
we have available secured and unsecured lines of credit with various parties in the amount of million that could be drawn upon to meet potential funding requirements 
the fhlb can cancel at any time any unused portion of the credit facilities 
any borrowings under these facilities are subject to the negotiated terms 
at december   short term investments totaled million  a decrease of million from at december   short term investments totaled million  an increase of million when compared to year end average short term investments was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the average yield on short term investments was in  in and in securities available for sale all of the company s securities at december   and are classified as available for sale and are managed by the treasury segment as part of the company s liquidity and interest rate risk management programs 
securities are reflected on the consolidated statements of condition at fair value 
any unrecognized differences between amortized cost and fair value are reported net of applicable taxes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity 
at december   and  the portfolio totaled billion  billion and billion and yielded an average of   and  respectively 
the percentage composition at fair value of the securities portfolio at december is as follows us treasury securities government agency securities mortgage backed securities other securities gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses at december  were million and thousand  respectively 
substantially all of our available for sale securities have been issued by the us treasury  an agency of the us government or a government sponsored entity such as the federal national mortgage association or the federal home loan mortgage corporation and therefore the repayment of substantially all of our securities is either guaranteed by the government or a aaa rated entity 
as a result  we believe that timely payment of principal and interest is assured and any unrealized gain or loss is therefore attributable to changes in market interest rates 
at december   and   and of the portfolio matures within one year and the portfolio duration is   and years  respectively 
although most of our contractual maturity dates are greater than one year  many of our securities have call features which allow the issuer to call the securities away from the bank 
because of the low level of interest rates many of these securities are now more likely to be called rather than mature and this is reflected in the duration calculation 
in addition  the bank owns mortgage backed securities which allow the borrowers of the underlying mortgages to prepay their mortgages 
because of the interest rate environment  prepayments on our mortgage backed securities is expected to be rapid and this is also factored into the overall portfolio duration calculation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
venture capital investments venture capital investments amounted to million at december  and million at the close of the prior year 
the company recorded a substantially unrealized loss of million on its venture capital investments in that is primarily attributable to unrealized losses in the fair value of its venture capital investments 
in  the company recorded a million loss  substantially unrealized  on these investments see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the losses in and are attributable to several factors 
first  there has been a general slowing of the domestic economy that was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks in september and continued uncertainty about potential military conflict 
this slowing resulted in large corporations reducing their spending on information technology assets  which in turn affected the financial performance and valuations of information technology asset vendors to which the company s venture capital portfolio was exposed 
second  the domestic stock market in general declined in and and  in particular  the valuations of publicly traded technology companies declined dramatically 
as a result  the company reduced the carrying value of a number of privately held investments in order to better align its valuations with those of comparable publicly traded companies 
third  initial public offerings ipos and acquisitions by public companies of private companies has declined significantly from prior years 
since venture capital investors typically look to the ipo process and acquisitions as a means of liquidating investments  the lack of such markets was detrimental to the value of investments held 
because of these factors and an uncertain economic outlook  the company in reduced its agreement to fund the operating costs of the venture capital partnerships for from million to thousand 
in  the company had reduced this agreement for from million to million 
also in  the company reduced its agreement to fund venture capital investments from a total of million to million 
at december   the company  since the inception of the venture capital segment  had funded approximately million of venture capital investments 
as previously noted  the company established a million valuation allowance against total deferred tax assets of million relating to venture capital losses 
the company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets which are attributable to losses from venture capital operations will be realized through capital gains generated by its venture capital operations or through such gains generated elsewhere within the company 
commitments and liquidity at december   the company had approximately billion of loan commitments outstanding and was contingently liable for million of letters of credit 
the company also is contractually obligated to fund million of venture capital investments and has various other contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company has the necessary liquidity to meet these obligations 
as noted previously  the company maintains a significant short term investment portfolio and has approximately million of unused credit lines 
the securities available for sale portfolio has a short duration 
in addition  deposits  the company s primary funding source  have been a very stable and low cost source of funds 
we operate with higher levels of liquidity than our peers do and our deposit base has been very stable for the three years ended december  however  changes in the stability of the economic  social or political environments  or a deterioration of the public s confidence in the banking system in general or the company in particular  could be very detrimental 
at december   the united states government directly or through its agencies and departments had deposits with the company of approximately billion 
a withdrawal of these funds by this depositor  for whatever reason  would significantly impact the company s short term liquidity position 
the simultaneous withdrawal of funds by a combination of large depositors also would have an adverse impact on company operations 
in addition  the fhlb has the authority to cancel the company s unused lines of credit 
another potential constraint on liquidity is regulatory limitations on dividends that the bank can pay to the company 
generally  such dividends are limited to the earnings of the bank for the current and prior two years less any dividend payments during the same period 
however  dividends payable by the bank and its subsidiaries are further limited by requirements for the maintenance of adequate capital and the underlying strength of the bank 
any restrictions on dividends that the bank can pay to the company could adversely impact the holding company s cash flow and its ability to fund future debt payments and dividends 
since regulatory authorities maintain that a holding company should be a source of financial strength for its subsidiary bank  dividends paid by the bank to the company  or by the company to its shareholders  might be restricted if the regulators conclude that the company s operating condition so warrants 
asset quality credit risk administration since the loan portfolio is the company s largest component of earning assets  one of the company s primary objectives is to maintain a high quality loan portfolio 
this is achieved through promulgation of and adherence to loan underwriting standards and regular evaluation of credit risk within the portfolio 
the potential for loss is  however  inherent to the lending process 
we attempt to minimize this risk by stressing the integrity  financial strength and liquidity of borrowers and  if integral to the granting of credit  the stability of supporting collateral values 
the credit administration function establishes credit policies including those related to credit underwriting  limits on the ability of an individual loan officer or group of loan officers to extend credit  policies addressing concentrations of credit risk and internal credit scoring 
the credit administration function reports to a chief credit officer who works with the various business units to ensure the integrity of established procedures and policies 
in addition  we maintain a loan review group that monitors compliance with these policies and thereby further ensures the integrity of the credit process see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
provision and reserve for loan losses the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses is determined based on our analysis of the composition of the loan portfolio  the level and trend of loan delinquencies  the financial condition of specific delinquent or problem borrowers and related guarantors  historical charge off rates  general economic and industry specific conditions and all other factors deemed relevant  including supervisory comment during the examination process 
based upon this analysis  which is performed quarterly and reviewed by a standing committee  we record a provision to maintain the reserve for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb probable losses in the portfolio 
for loan pools with homogeneous characteristics  such as residential mortgage  home equity and consumer loans  provisions are determined using historical loss factors 
for non homogeneous loans  the company allocates specific reserves for loan losses to individual loans in the highest risk categories and provides for the remainder using historical factors 
in addition  the company maintains a qualitative component in its reserve for loan losses 
this portion of the reserve is adjusted when the company concludes that recent charge off experience may not be indicative of future experience  either adverse general economic or industry specific conditions are not manifested as specific problem credits or in delinquency ratios  or we have knowledge of specific potentially adverse events or conditions of a borrower 
the company maintains its reserve for loan losses in accordance with a board of directors approved policy 
based upon the above  the company recorded a loan loss provision of thousand in at december   the reserve for loan losses was million  or approximately 
of loans and of the company s nonaccrual  renegotiated  days past due and other potential problem credits 
the foreign reserve for loan losses was million  or approximately of foreign loans 
reserve coverage was greatly improved as nonperforming assets decreased from million at december  to thousand a year later 
foreign nonperforming assets represent approximately of consolidated nonperforming assets 
the foreign loan loss provision in was approximately million and the domestic provision was million 
the foreign reversal was taken as those reserves were no longer necessary since foreign nonperforming assets decreased by million  or  from the prior year end  aggregate loan balances decreased due to significant pay downs and maturities  and we sold million in commercial loans and commitments at our london operations 
we recorded loan loss provisions of million and million in and  respectively 
the provision was comprised of a million foreign provision and a domestic provision 
the domestic provision was the result of a reduction in domestic nonperforming loans from million at december  to thousand a year later 
the provision included million for the discovery of a borrower s fraud in a commercial credit in the international banking segment as well as a million loss incurred on the sale of a syndicated loan in the banking segment 
these provisions were also the result of additions to nonperforming loans during these years and increased loan charge offs 
the reserve for loan losses to loans at december  and was and  respectively 
at december  and  the reserve for loan losses was and  respectively  of the company s nonaccrual  renegotiated  days past due and other potential problem credits 
during the three years ended december   the reserve for loan losses as a percentage of loans has decreased from to 
during this same period  nonaccrual  renegotiated  days past due and other potential problem credits decreased from million to million 
in addition  of the company s portfolio is secured by residential real estate at december  traditionally  net losses on such loans have been minimal see table h of this form k 
foreign exchange translation adjustments in the reserve for loan losses were thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
these adjustments relate to reserves recorded in british pounds sterling  and are made to account for changes in our reserve for loan losses resulting from fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
the estimated allocation of the reserve for loan losses by loan category is detailed in table i of this form k and represents our assessment of existing conditions and risk factors within these categories 
changes in the risk characteristic and loan amounts within the loan portfolio affect the overall level of required reserves 
during  the commercial and financial allocation of the reserve for loan losses increased thousand from the increased allocation was based on the growth in the balance of these loans discussed previously under loans along with a refinement in our reserve allocation methodologies see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  renegotiated loans  other real estate owned and other repossessed assets 
nonaccrual loans are loans for which recognition of interest income has been discontinued 
impaired loans are nonaccrual loans for which it is probable that all amounts due will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement see tables j and k of this form k 
we evaluate each past due commercial loan commercial and financial loans and commercial real estate loans and discontinue the accrual of interest based on the delinquency status  an evaluation of any collateral and the financial condition of the borrower 
if there is doubt as to the collection of either principal or interest  or when interest or principal is days past due and the commercial loan is not well secured and in the process of collection  it is placed into nonaccrual status 
a nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual status when interest and principal payments are brought current and the collection of future payments is not in doubt 
nonaccrual loans totaled thousand at december   a decrease of thousand from december  the decrease in nonaccrual loans was primarily attributable to payoffs of thousand and charge offs of thousand  mostly on foreign commercial loans  partially offset by additions to the foreign portfolio of thousand 
income recognition on non commercial loans is discontinued and the loans are generally charged off or loan foreclosure proceedings begun upon becoming days delinquent or at such time as permitted by law or other regulations 
at this point  any uncollected interest is eliminated from income 
renegotiated loans are those where there have been extensions of the original repayment period or a reduction of the obligation to pay principal or interest because of a deterioration in the borrower s financial position 
at december   and  none of the renegotiated loans was accruing interest 
there were no renegotiated loans at december  as the remaining two loans in that category were paid off and charged off  respectively  compared with balances of thousand at year end and thousand at december  loans are transferred to other real estate and other repossessed assets owned when collateral securing the loans is acquired through foreclosure 
other real estate and other repossessed assets owned totaled thousand on december   compared to million on december  and million at december  in our only remaining real estate owned property  with a balance of thousand  was sold 
at our operations in london  other assets owned activity included sales  write offs and additions that netted to a million decrease in the portfolio 
the ending balance consists entirely of these other assets  which are automobiles and other equipment that secured problem loans which were seized as part of the loan liquidation efforts of the company in that location see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
past due and potential problem loans the days past due loan category amounted to million  million  and million at december   and  respectively 
the balances for all three years are primarily attributable to secured residential real estate loans that are in the process of collection and are accruing interest 
potential problem loans are defined as loans that are currently performing but which have certain attributes that may lead to nonaccrual or past due status in the foreseeable future 
at december   we identified million of potential problem loans compared to thousand of such loans at december  and million at december  the current year balance consists primarily of a commercial lease financing loan of million at our london operation 
at december   this loan is performing but is considered to be a potential problem credit because the borrower is in technical violation of a loan covenant 
we are closely monitoring this credit 
foreign loans and other credits may be adversely affected by social  economic and political instabilities  including military confrontations 
the company cannot estimate the losses  if any  associated with any such instabilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
deposits and funding sources deposits  short term borrowings  fhlb and long term debt and trust preferred securities are our principal funding sources 
for  these funding sources averaged billion  an increase of million from the billion for in  these funding sources averaged billion 
deposits deposit balances are the primary funding source of the company 
the average deposit balance at december  was billion and for each of the two years ending december  and was billion 
average interest bearing deposits were billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
average demand deposits were million  million and million in  and as a means of reducing deposit reserve requirements  we periodically sweep excess demand funds into money market accounts 
the average balances transferred  which are not included in demand deposits in table a of this form k  were million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits was  and in  and  respectively 
the change in the cost of these funds is primarily attributable to actions of the federal reserve 
from december  to year end  the federal reserve lowered its target federal funds rate by basis points  from to 
short term borrowings short term borrowings consist primarily of repurchase agreements and  to a lesser extent  federal funds purchased and short term fhlb borrowings 
these obligations are an additional source of funds used to meet liquidity and interest rate risk management objectives 
on average  short term borrowings were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the cost of these funds was  and for  and see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fhlb borrowings and other long term debt the million balance of long term debt at december  consists of million subordinated debentures due in and million in fhlb advances 
the million balance of long term debt at december  and consists of the subordinated debentures only 
these debentures have a fixed interest rate of and are not callable in advance of maturity 
the effective cost of this debt is 
the fhlb advances were taken in december they have maturity dates through and carry a blended interest rate of 
average long term debt was million in  compared to million in and because of its strong capital position  in the bank completed a million leverage strategy by purchasing mortgage backed securities  funded primarily with advances of varying maturities from the fhlb of atlanta noted above 
the goal of this strategy is to increase net interest income 
the assets purchased had an average yield of and an average life of years 
the funding sources had an opportunity cost of and an average life of years see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
minority interest in trust preferred securities trust preferred securities totaled and million at december  and  respectively 
included in these securities are million of securities issued in and million of securities issued in the securities were issued by two of our wholly owned subsidiaries and are classified on the consolidated statements of condition as guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
the related expense is included on the consolidated statements of operations as part of minority interest in income of subsidiaries  net of taxes 
dividends are paid semi annually and these securities cannot be redeemed for ten years from the date of issuance 
the securities have a final maturity of years from their issuance date 
dividends are cumulative and deferrable for a period not to exceed five years 
these securities qualify as tier i capital  with certain limitations 
amounts not included in tier i capital are included in tier ii capital see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the company repurchased  for cash  million of the securities and million of the  with a blended coupon rate of 
these repurchases will result in future after tax annual savings of million in minority interest expense 
these repurchases were at a discount and resulted in a direct after tax increase to shareholders equity of million 
since cash was utilized to repurchase the trust preferred securities  this cash will be unavailable for alternative investments 
we continue to evaluate the repurchase of additional trust preferred securities 
the repurchase of the trust preferred securities primarily impacts the other segment 
if the sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity ballot draft  issued as a draft on january   becomes effective as currently written  beginning in the third quarter of these guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures will no longer be classified as minority interest on the consolidated statements of condition  but will be classified as long term debt 
the related interest expense  currently classified as minority interest  net of taxes  on our consolidated statements of operations  will be reported as interest expense  thereby decreasing net interest income 
sensitivity to market and other risk as previously noted  the company is exposed to various business risks 
two types of market risk that could materially impact the operating results of the company are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange exposure 
though our asset liability committee alco closely monitors our exposure to these risks  shortcomings in assumptions utilized or modeling techniques employed may prevent or limit the company from controlling or mitigating such risks 
we manage our interest rate risk through the use of an income simulation model  which forecasts the impact on net interest income of a variety of different interest rate scenarios 
a most likely interest rate scenario is forecasted based upon an analysis of current market conditions and expectations 
the model then evaluates the impact on net interest income of rates moving significantly higher or lower than the most likely scenario 
most likely is defined as the outlook of the bank s treasury group on the path of future interest rates 
as of december   the most likely interest rate scenario calls for the federal funds target rate to be flat at through december the federal funds target rate then rises gradually to by april  holding at that level for the remainder of the forecast horizon 
the results are compared to risk tolerance limits set by corporate policy 
the model s results as of december  are shown in table m of this form k 
current policy establishes limits for possible changes in net interest income for and month horizons 
the interest rate scenarios monitored by alco are based upon a basis point gradual increase or decrease in rates over a month time period versus the most likely scenario and a basis point gradual increase or decrease in rates over a month time period versus the most likely scenario 
as of december   the forecasted impact of rates rising or falling basis points versus the most likely scenario over a month time period was a change in net interest income not exceeding 
for a basis point movement in rates versus the most likely scenario over a month period  the impact on net interest income did not exceed 
the results of the simulation for december  indicated that the bank was liability sensitive due to a large portion of its assets being comprised of fixed rate instruments 
earnings benefit in a declining rate environment from increasing spreads on fixed rate assets but are offset somewhat by floors on deposit rates and faster prepayment rates on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
in managing our interest rate risk  alco uses financial derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps 
financial derivatives are employed to assist in the management and or reduction of our interest rate risk and can effectively alter the interest rate sensitivity of the company 
along with financial derivative instruments  the income simulation model includes assumptions about short term financial instruments  investment securities  loans  deposits  and other borrowings 
though we find that the methodologies previously discussed provide a meaningful representation of our interest rate and market risk sensitivity  factors other than changes in the interest rate environment  such as levels of non earning assets  and changes in the composition of earning assets  may affect our risk sensitivity  and  therefore  our net interest income 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in our model 
as such  the predictive value of our model is not guaranteed 
at december  and  our cumulative one year gap was million and million  respectively 
a small negative gap  such as that which exists at december   indicates that the company s interest rate position is balanced 
a negative gap position indicates that the company would be adversely impacted by rising interest rates since interest bearing deposits would reprice more quickly than interest earning assets 
at december   we had a foreign currency exchange contract for a notional amount of million to hedge the investment we have in rbel 
we had million in commitments to purchase foreign currency and million in commitments to sell foreign currency 
most of these commitments were undertaken to hedge intercompany loans 
in addition  interest rate swaps were used to hedge interest rate risk 
some were used to hedge the fair value of fixed rate assets while others were used to hedge cash flows of variable rate liabilities 
there were such agreements at december   totaling million in notional principal balance see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our current interest rate sensitivity level is appropriate considering our economic outlook and conservative approach taken in the review and monitoring of our sensitivity position see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to interest rate and market risk  we are exposed to customer relationship risk  which may be increased because we have foreign customers 
as with credit risk  we strive to monitor and minimize this risk exposure 
nonetheless  these customers may be subject to deteriorating economic conditions  political and social upheaval  currency depreciation or devaluation  as well as nationalization and expropriation of assets or other factors over which we have no control 
these customers also may have national goals and strategies  with political overtones  which could conflict with ours and therefore have a future negative impact on the company 
some of our foreign loans are loans to sovereign entities 
if  for any reason  such a loan became past due or a problem credit  collection efforts would be made more difficult because of the sovereign status of the borrower 
capital resources one of our fundamental objectives is to maintain a level of capitalization that promotes depositor and investor confidence 
in addition to maintaining conservative loan underwriting standards  the company places an emphasis on capital strength and our ability to withstand unfavorable economic conditions and business losses 
we maintained a strong capital position at december  and  even after the operating loss incurred in the company s policy is to ensure that the bank is capitalized in accordance with regulatory guidelines 
as discussed  the bank is subject to minimum capital ratios as prescribed by the occ  which are essentially the same as those prescribed by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies 
total shareholders equity at december  was million  a million increase from year end the increase was primarily the result of net income of million  unrealized securities gains of million  and a million increase in paid in capital due to the previously described trust preferred securities repurchases 
these increases were partially offset by million in dividend payments for the year 
shareholders equity at december  was million  a million decrease from year end the decrease was the result of the million operating loss the company incurred in banking regulators have issued risk based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies 
these requirements provide minimum total  tier i  and leverage capital ratios that measure capital adequacy 
the total capital ratio measures combined tier i and tier ii capital to risk weighted assets 
the tier i capital ratio measures tier i capital to risk weighted assets 
the leverage capital ratio measures tier i capital to quarterly average assets 
at december  and  the company s and bank s capital ratios significantly exceeded the well capitalized levels under each of the regulatory ratios see table n of this form k and note of notes to consolidated financial statements

sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was issued in june it addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
unlike eitf  sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  instead of at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
this statement does not affect the company at the present time  but will be complied with when and if it becomes necessary 
sfas  acquisitions of certain financial institutions  an amendment of fasb statements and and fasb interpretation  was issued in july it removes acquisitions of financial institutions from the scope of both fasb statement and fasb interpretation  except for transactions between two or more mutual enterprises 
instead  it requires that acquisitions of financial institutions be accounted for in accordance with sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement does not affect the company at the present time  but will be complied with when and if it becomes necessary 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement  was issued in december it amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provision of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
finally  this statement amends apb opinion  interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
this statement does not affect the company at the present time as we currently have no plans to change to the fair value based method 
on january   the fasb directed its staff to prepare a ballot draft of sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity 
the final statement is expected to be issued in early sfas establishes standards for issuers classification as liabilities in the statement of financial position of financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity  including financial instruments that are mandatorily redeemable on a fixed or determinable date 
our trust preferred securities  currently classified on our consolidated statements of condition as a minority interest item  meet that description 
sfas will be effected by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for contracts created before the issuance date of this statement and still existing at the beginning of the reporting period 
we will begin reporting our trust preferred securities as a liability once sfas becomes effective 
the related interest expense  currently classified as minority interest  net of taxes  on our consolidated statements of operations  will be reported as interest expense  thereby decreasing net interest income 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantors  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and recission of fasb interpretation no 
under fin  a liability must be recognized at the inception of certain guarantees whether or not payment is probable 
when the guarantor has assumed a stand ready obligation  the fair value of the guarantee must be recorded as a liability 
this interpretation was effective at december   with the disclosure provisions of fin effective in and the accounting provisions effective in in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the issue of consolidation of variable interest entities  which were previously commonly referred to as special purpose entities spes 
generally  in a variable interest entity the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to allow the entity to function without subordinated financial support from other parties that absorb some of the expected losses and the equity investors do not have the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  as defined 
according to fin  if a business has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities and operating results of the variable interest entity should be consolidated with the business  even if the business does not have voting control of the variable interest entity 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to interests in variable interest entities acquired after that date 
fin also applies to the first interim or fiscal periods beginning after june  for those variable interest entities in which a business holds an interest that was acquired before february  riggs is currently evaluating the impact fin will have on its operations 
fourth quarter vs

noninterest income totaled million in the fourth quarter of  an increase of million from the million in the comparable quarter of the prior year primarily due to the decreases in venture capital losses noted previously 
also contributing to the increase was an additional million in securities gains  from thousand in the fourth quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of trust and investment advisory income was million and million for the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
the decrease is attributable to the decline in the value of assets under management and to the previously mentioned renegotiated agreement with the real estate advisor to mept 
as a result of that renegotiation  revenues related to this business activity were million for the quarter ended december   a decrease of million from the comparable period of noninterest expense for the fourth quarter was million  compared to million in the year ago quarter  a decrease of
