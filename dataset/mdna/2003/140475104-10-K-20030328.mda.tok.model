item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis addresses the company s results of operations on a historical consolidated basis for the years ended december   and the following should be read in conjunction with the company s historical consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data contained elsewhere in this report 
the company is one of the largest operators of senior living communities in the united states in terms of resident capacity 
the company s operating strategy is to provide high quality senior living services at an affordable price to its residents  while achieving and sustaining a strong  competitive position within its chosen markets  as well as to continue to enhance the performance of its operations 
the company provides a wide array of senior living services to the elderly at its communities  including independent living  assisted living with special programs and living units at some of its communities for residents with alzheimer s and other forms of dementia  skilled nursing and home care services 
the company has acquired interests in and operates senior living communities 
the company generates revenue from a variety of sources 
for the year ended december   the company s revenues were derived as follows from the operation of owned communities  from lease rentals from triple net leases  from management fees arising from management services provided for affiliate owned senior living communities and third party owned senior living communities  and from development fees earned for managing the development and construction of new senior living communities for affiliate owned senior living communities 
the company believes that the factors affecting the financial performance of communities managed under contracts with third parties do not vary substantially from the factors affecting the performance of owned and leased communities  although there are different business risks associated with these activities 
the company s third party management fees are primarily based on a percentage of gross revenues 
as a result  the cash flow and profitability of such contracts to the company are more dependent on the revenues generated by such communities and less dependent on net cash flow than for owned communities 
further  the company is not responsible for capital investments in managed communities

the company s current management contracts expire on various dates through september and provide for management fees based generally upon of net revenues 
in addition  certain of the contracts provide for supplemental incentive fees that vary by contract based upon the financial performance of the managed community 
the company s development fees are generally based upon a percentage of construction cost and are earned over the period commencing with the initial development activities and ending with the opening of the community

management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience  observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require managements most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition resident and health care revenue is recognized at estimated net realizable amounts  based on historical experiences  due from residents in the period to which the rental and other services are provided 
revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs accounted for of the company s net revenues in under the medicare program  payments are determined based on established rates that differ from private pay rates 
revenue from the medicare program is recorded at established rates and adjusted for differences between such rates and estimated amounts payable from the program 
any differences between estimated and actual reimbursements are included in operations in the year of settlement  which have not been material 
under the medicaid program  communities are entitled to reimbursement at established rates that are lower than private pay rates 
patient service revenue for medicaid patients is recorded at the reimbursement rates as the rates are set prospectively by the state upon the filing of an annual cost report 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
the company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
regulatory inquiries occur in the ordinary course of business and compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines  penalties  and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
management services revenue and development fees are recognized when earned 
management services revenue relates to providing certain management and administrative support services under management contracts 
the company s management contracts include contingent management services revenue  usually based on exceeding certain gross revenue targets 
these contingent revenues are recognized based on actual results according to the calculations specified in the various management agreements 
investments in partnerships and amounts due from affiliates triad entities the company has opened  in connection with its management agreements  seventeen new waterford and wellington communities and two expansions in the last four years pursuant to arrangements with the triad entities

the company has loan commitments to the triad entities for construction and pre marketing expenses  in addition to requirements to fund the triad entities operating deficits through operating deficit guarantees provided for in its management agreements with the triad entities and other advances  totaling million at december  the company evaluates the carrying value of these receivables by comparing the cash flows expected from the operations of the triad entities to the carrying value of the receivables 
these cash flow models consider lease up rates  expected operating costs  debt service requirements and various other factors 
in addition  the company entered into a support agreement with the triad entities during the third quarter of  whereby  each of triad ii  triad iii  triad iv and triad v agreed to loan excess cash flow of such triad to any one or more of triad i  triad ii  triad iii  triad iv and triad v 
the carrying value of the notes receivable from the triad entities could be adversely affected by a number of factors including the triad communities experiencing slower than expected lease up  lower than expected lease rates  higher than expected operating costs  increases in interest rates  issues involving debt service requirements  general adverse market conditions  other economic factors and changes in accounting guidelines 
management believes that the carrying value of the notes receivable are fully recoverable  based on the support agreement  factors within its control and the future achievement of the assumptions used in these cash flow models  which are consistent with the company s operating experience 
deferred interest income is being amortized into income over the life of the loan commitment that the company has with each of the triad entities 
deferred development and management fee income is being amortized into income over the expected remaining life of the triad partnerships 
under equity accounting  the company has recognized losses in the triad entities of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the recognition of these losses has reduced the company s investments in the triad entities to zero and additional losses of million have been recorded as a reduction to the company s notes receivable from the triad entities 
the company s share of future losses will also be recorded as a reduction of notes receivable from the triad entities 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january  and effective for the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  for variable interest entities that existed prior to february  the company will adopt the provisions of this interpretation  in the third quarter of  and its adoption will result in the company consolidating the financial statements of the triad entities  currently accounted for separately under the equity method of accounting 
the company expects the implementation of fasb interpretation no
