item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  our consolidated historical financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this report 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december of each year 
our first quarter consists of weeks  and the other three quarters consist of weeks 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under forward looking statements and risk factors elsewhere in this report 
general at december   we had  stores operating under the advance auto parts trade name  in states in the northeastern  southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states 
additionally  we operated stores under the advance discount auto parts trade name and stores operating under the discount auto parts trade name in florida 
we also had stores operating under the western auto trade name primarily located in puerto rico and the virgin islands 
we operate in the united states automotive aftermarket industry  which includes replacement parts excluding tires  accessories  maintenance items  batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks pick ups  vans  minivans and sport utility vehicles 
we are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items to diy customers in the united states  based on store count and sales 
we currently are the largest specialty retailer of automotive products in the majority of the states in which we operate  based on store count 
our combined operations are conducted in two operating segments  retail and wholesale 
the retail segment consists of our retail operations operating under the trade names advance auto parts  advance discount auto parts and discount auto parts in the united states and western auto primarily in puerto rico and the virgin islands 
our wholesale segment includes a wholesale distribution network which provides distribution services of automotive parts  accessories and specialty items to approximately independently owned dealer stores in states primarily operating under the western auto trade name 
our wholesale operations accounted for 
table of contents approximately of our net sales for the year ended december  acquisitions trak auto parts acquisition 
in july  we announced we had received bankruptcy court approval to acquire certain assets of trak including the leases on stores in virginia  washington  dc and maryland 
in september  we agreed to acquire two additional trak stores 
we believe the trak acquisition gave us the number one market position  based on store count  in the washington dc baltimore area with stores 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  each store s results of operations has been included in our financial statements from the date each store was transferred to us 
negative goodwill of million  resulting from excess fair value over the purchase price  was allocated proportionately as a reduction to certain noncurrent assets 
as of december   we had taken ownership and converted all stores to the advance auto parts store format  assumed the respective lease obligations and had paid million for inventory and fixtures 
discount acquisition 
on november   we acquired discount in a transaction in which discount s shareholders received per share in cash or approximately million in the aggregate plus shares of our common stock for each share of discount common stock 
we issued approximately million shares of our common stock to the former discount shareholders  which represented of our total shares outstanding immediately following the acquisition 
at november   discount had stores in six states  including the leading market position in florida  based on store count  with stores 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations for discount for the periods from december  are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
negative goodwill of million  resulting from total excess fair value over the purchase price  was allocated proportionately as a reduction to non current assets  primarily property and equipment 
during  we reduced negative goodwill by million due to purchase accounting adjustments primarily made to adjust the fair market value of certain inventory  equipment  the related deferred income tax effects and to reduce certain severance and relocation liabilities 
during  we integrated all of the acquired discount stores located outside the state of florida and in the florida panhandle 
this conversion included both a system conversion to our store system and a physical conversion to the advance auto parts store format and merchandise offerings 
we also completed the alignment of merchandise offerings in all discount stores in the state of florida to our product offerings  physically converted of the florida stores and converted approximately half of the florida stores to our store systems 
the physically converted stores have undergone the complete conversion to the new advance discount auto parts format 
we anticipate completing the store system conversions by the end of the physical conversion will continue through fiscal during the integration  we closed discount stores in overlapping markets with our existing stores 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of these accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are used in the preparation of the financial statements as discussed above 
vendor incentives we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other functional discounts 
many of the incentives are under long term agreements terms in excess of one year  while others are negotiated on an annual basis 
our vendors require us to use certain cooperative advertising allowances 
table of contents exclusively for advertising 
we define these allowances as restricted cooperative advertising allowances and recognize them as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses as advertising expenditures are incurred 
the remaining cooperative advertising allowances not restricted by our vendors  or unrestricted  rebates and other functional incentives are earned based on purchases and or the sale of the product 
amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets included in the financial statements in part iv 
item of this report 
we record unrestricted cooperative advertising and volume rebates earned as a reduction of inventory and recognize the incentives as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 
short term incentives are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the annual agreement term and are not recorded as reductions to inventory 
we recognize the other functional discounts earned related to long term agreements as a reduction to cost of sales over the life of the agreement based on the timing of purchases 
these incentives are not recorded as reductions to inventory 
the functional amounts earned under long term arrangements are based on our estimate of total purchases that will be made over the life of the contracts and the amount of incentives that will be earned 
the incentives are generally recognized based on the cumulative purchases as a percentage of total estimated purchases over the life of the contract 
our margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates but over the life of the contract would be the same 
inventory inventory shrink reserves are recorded related to our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent cycle counting program 
our estimates related to these shrink reserves depend on the effectiveness of the cycle counting programs 
we evaluate the effectiveness of these programs on an on going basis and believe they provide reasonable assurance for the recorded reserves 
reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories are recorded as well 
the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal 
in addition  we have historically been able to return excess items to the vendor for credit 
we provide reserves where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
warranties our vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims 
merchandise and services sold under warranty  which are not covered by vendors warranties  include batteries  tires  road side assistance and craftsman products 
we record accruals for future warranty claims based on current sales of the warranted products and historical claim experience 
if claims experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required 
we have recently seen positive trends in the defective rates of our batteries sold  which have offset historically higher trends used to develop our battery warranty accrual 
we believe these positive trends are a result of quality enhancements of our currently offered battery line and better policies and procedures surrounding the testing and defecting of batteries by our store personnel 
restructuring and closed store liabilities we recognize a provision for future obligations at the time a decision is made to close a store location and includes future minimum lease payments  common area maintenance and taxes 
additionally  we make certain assumptions related to potential subleases and lease buyouts that reduce the recorded amount of the accrual 
these assumptions are based on our knowledge of the market and the relevant experience 
however  the inability to enter into the subleases or obtain buyouts due to a change in the economy or prevailing real estate markets for these properties within the estimated timeframe may result in increases or decreases to these reserves 
contingencies we accrue for obligations  including estimated legal costs  when it is probable and the amount is reasonably 
table of contents estimable 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position both with respect to gain contingencies and accrued liabilities and other potential exposures 
estimates that are particularly sensitive to future change include tax  environmental and legal matters  which are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process 
components of statement of operations net sales net sales consist primarily of comparable store sales  new store net sales  service net sales  net sales to the wholesale dealer network and finance charges on installment sales

relocations are included in comparable store sales from the original date of opening 
the stores acquired in the carport acquisition are included in the comparable store sales calculation following complete accounting periods after their system conversion to the advance auto parts store system 
stores acquired in the discount acquisition were included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning in december  which was complete accounting periods after the acquisition date of november  we do not include net sales from the western auto retail stores in our comparable store sales calculation as a result of their unique product offerings  including specialty merchandise and service 
cost of sales our cost of sales includes merchandise costs and warehouse and distribution expenses as well as service labor costs of our western auto stores 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix  price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs and vendor programs 
we seek to avoid fluctuation in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into long term purchasing agreements with vendors when we believe it is advantageous 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised of store payroll  store occupancy including rent  net advertising expenses  other store expenses and general and administrative expenses  including salaries and related benefits of corporate team members  administrative office expenses  data processing  professional expenses and other related expenses

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had outstanding indebtedness consisting of million of senior discount debentures  million of senior subordinated notes and borrowings of million under our senior credit facility 
additionally  we had borrowed million under our revolving credit facility and had million in letters of credit outstanding  which reduced our availability under the revolving credit facility to million 
our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion program  including new store openings and store acquisitions  store relocations and remodels  inventory requirements  the construction and upgrading of distribution centers  the development and implementation of proprietary information systems and our strategic acquisitions 
we have financed our growth through a combination of cash generated from operations  borrowings under the credit facility and issuances of equity 
our new stores  if leased  require capital expenditures of approximately  per store and an inventory investment of approximately  per store  net of vendor payables 
a portion of the inventory investment is held at a distribution facility 
pre opening expenses  consisting primarily of store set up costs and training of new store team members  average approximately  per store and are expensed when incurred 
our future capital requirements will depend on the number of new stores we open or acquire and the timing of those openings or acquisitions within a given year 
we opened new stores during each of and including stores acquired in the trak and carport acquisitions  but excluding stores acquired in the discount acquisition

we anticipate that inventory levels will continue to increase primarily as a result of new store openings 
our capital expenditures were million in excluding consideration paid in the trak acquisition 
these amounts related to the new store openings  the upgrade of our information systems including our new point of sale and electronic parts catalog system and remodels and relocations of existing stores  including our conversion of discount stores 
in  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million  of which approximately million will involve the continued conversion of stores associated with the discount acquisition 
as part of normal operations  we continually monitor store performance  which results in our closing or relocating certain store locations that do not meet profitability objectives

at december   the restructuring reserves had a remaining balance of million  of which million is recorded as a current liability 
additionally  at december   the total liability for the deferred compensation plans was million  of which million  is recorded as a current liability

we reserve the right to change or terminate the 
table of contents benefits or contributions at any time 
we also continue to evaluate ways in which we can better manage these benefits and control costs 
any changes in the plan or revisions to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may have a significant impact on the amount of the reported obligation and annual expense 
effective december  we amended our plan to only include benefits for team members who are eligible at january  this negative plan amendment resulted in a curtailment gain of million which will be amortized over years to offset corresponding increases in health care cost trends

is effective immediately for goodwill and intangibles acquired after june  for fiscal year  we had amortization expense of approximately related to existing goodwill of  at december  such amortization has been eliminated upon adoption of sfas no 
we implemented sfas no 
during the first quarter of the implementation had no material impact on our financial position or the results of our operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and an associated asset retirement cost 
this statement applies to all entities that have legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal use of the assets and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
this statement replaces both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and accounting principles board  or apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions from both sfas no 
and apb no 
but includes changes to improve financial reporting and comparability among entities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of fiscal with no material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
as a result of rescinding fasb statement no 
 reporting gains losses from extinguishment of debt  gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in apb no 
this statement also amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
additional amendments include changes to other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
during the first quarter of fiscal for  we recorded an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of debt  net of tax  of million 
accordingly  reclassifications of this loss to income from continuing operations will be made throughout fiscal to maintain comparability for the reported periods 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for cost associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred instead of at the date an entity commits to an exit plan 
the statement is effective for exit and disposal activities entered into after december  we do not expect adopting this 
table of contents statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september as subsequently updated in november  the fasb released eitf issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
this eitf addresses how a reseller should account for consideration received from a vendor since eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer only addresses the accounting treatment from the vendor s perspective 
the consensus is that cash received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the vendor s products or services and should  therefore  be characterized as a reduction in the cost of sales when recognized in the customer s income statement  unless a reimbursement of costs is incurred by the customer to sell the vendor s products  in which case the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost when recognized in the customer s income statement 
additionally  any rebate or refund should also be recognized as a reduction of the cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation 
the release is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  we believe our current accounting policy for vendor incentives meets the requirements of this eitf and therefore we do not expect adopting this release will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation to allow for alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock issued to team members 
this statement also amends fasb no 
to require disclosure of the accounting method used for valuation in both annual and interim financial statements 
this statement permits an entity to recognize compensation expense under the prospective method  modified prospective method or the retroactive restatement method 
if an entity elects to adopt this statement  fiscal years beginning after december  must include this change in accounting for stock based team member compensation 
we are currently evaluating the effect of voluntarily adopting the fair value provisions of sfas no 
and will elect a transition method if the fair value method is adopted 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation sets forth expanded disclosure requirements in the financial statements about a guarantor s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that  under certain circumstances  a guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation at the inception of the guarantee 
certain types of guarantees  such as product warranties  guarantees accounted for as derivatives  and guarantees related to parent subsidiary relationships are excluded from the liability recognition provisions of interpretation no 
 however  they are subject to the disclosure requirements 
the initial liability recognition provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of interpretation no 
are effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december  we have no guarantees of third party indebtedness and do not believe the adoption of these new rules will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
interpretation no 
prescribes how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
interpretation no 
is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
the interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we do not have interests in variable interest entities and do not believe the adoption of interpretation no 
will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors risks relating to our business 
table of contents we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful 
we have increased our store count significantly from  stores at the end of to  stores at december  we intend to continue to expand our base of stores as part of our growth strategy  primarily by opening new stores 
there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors  including  among other things  our ability to manage the expansion and hire  train and retain qualified sales associates  the availability of potential store locations in highly visible  well trafficked areas and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms for new locations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales 
the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on our ability to properly merchandise  market and price the products required in their respective markets 
furthermore  we may acquire or try to acquire stores or businesses from  make investments in  or enter into strategic alliances with  companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence 
any future acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks  including the difficulty of identifying appropriate acquisition candidates  the difficulty of assimilating and integrating the operations of the respective entities  the potential disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our management s attention  the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and the impairment of relationships with team members and customers as a result of changes in management 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances or related efforts 
we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy  including increasing comparable store sales  enhancing our margins and increasing our return on capital  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales  enhance our margins and increase our return on capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow 
if these initiatives are unsuccessful  or if we are unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
successful implementation of our growth strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control 
these include adverse changes in general economic conditions and conditions in local markets  which could reduce our sales  the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices or increase spending  the automotive aftermarket parts manufacturing industry  such as consolidation  which may disrupt or sever one or more of our vendor relationships  our ability to anticipate and meet changes in consumer preferences for automotive products  accessories and services in a timely manner  and our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  which depends in part on the types of recruiting  training and benefit programs we adopt 
disruptions in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors operations could increase our cost of goods sold 
our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and upon the vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and other terms 
many factors outside of our 
table of contents control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms 
for example  financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them 
in addition  the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or sever our relationship with some vendors  and could lead to less competition and  consequently  higher prices 
if demand for products sold by our stores slows  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow for a number of reasons  including the weather  as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of inclement weather  and the economy  as during periods of good economic conditions  more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own cars 
in periods of declining economic conditions  both diy and difm customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair 
if any of these factors cause demand for the products we sell to decline  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
we depend on the services of our existing management team and may not be able to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executive officers and senior management team 
if for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management  our business could suffer 
we have entered into employment agreements with some of our executive officers and senior management  however  these agreements do not ensure their continued employment with us 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain additional qualified senior executives as needed in the future  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the retail automotive parts industry  we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 
the retail sale of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas  including price  name recognition  customer service and location 
we compete primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains  wholesalers or jobber stores  independent operators  automobile dealers that supply parts  discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts  accessories and maintenance items 
some of our competitors possess advantages over us  including substantially greater financial and marketing resources  a larger number of stores  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger and more established customer bases and more established vendor relationships 
our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices or increase our spending  which would lower revenue and profitability 
competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines or require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies 
if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages  we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 
because we are involved in litigation from time to time  and are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations  we could incur substantial judgments  fines  legal fees and other costs 
we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers  employees or other third parties for various actions 
in particular  we are currently involved in litigation involving claims relating to  among other things  breach of contract  anti competitive behavior  tortious conduct  employment discrimination  asbestos exposure and product defect 
the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial 
although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims  if one or more of the claims greatly exceeds our coverage limits or our insurance policies do not cover a claim  it could have a material adverse affect on our business and 
table of contents operating results 
additionally  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to employment matters  environmental protection and building and zoning requirements 
if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions 
in addition  our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these or future laws or regulations 
we may not be able to successfully complete the integration of discount  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we acquired discount to capitalize on its leading market position in florida  to increase our store base in our southeastern markets and to create the opportunity for potential cost savings through operational synergies 
achieving the expected benefits of the discount acquisition will depend in large part on our completion of the integration of discount s operations and personnel in a timely and efficient manner 
some of the objectives we still need to accomplish include successfully converting discount s operations in the state of florida to our information and accounting systems  converting the lakeland distribution center to our distribution center management system  successfully completing the format and signage conversion of discount stores to advance discount auto parts stores in the florida market  and transitioning customer awareness and loyalty to new store formats and merchandising strategy 
if we cannot successfully complete the integration of discount  our ability to manage discount s business effectively and profitably could suffer 
in addition  key team members may leave and customer service standards could deteriorate 
moreover  the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business and discount s business as it will divert the attention of management from its normal operational responsibilities and duties 
our failure to successfully complete the integration of discount could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to our financial condition our level of debt and restrictions in our debt instruments may limit our ability to take certain actions  including obtaining additional financing in the future  that we would otherwise consider in our best interest 
we currently have a significant amount of debt 
at december   we had total debt of approximately million 
our high level of debt could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could impair our ability to implement our growth strategy  impair our ability to obtain additional financing  if needed  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes in the future  place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt  restrict our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions  increase our vulnerability to adverse economic  industry and business conditions  or cause our interest expense to increase if interest rates in general were to increase because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at a floating rate 
our ability to service our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our operations may not generate the amount of cash we need 
we will need a significant amount of cash to service our debt 
our ability to generate cash depends on our successful financial and operating performance 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations 
our financial and 
table of contents operational performance also depends upon a number of other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include economic and competitive conditions in the automotive aftermarket industry  and operating difficulties  operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience 
if we are unable to service our debt  we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as selling assets  refinancing or restructuring our debt or raising additional equity capital 
however  we cannot assure you that any alternative strategies will be feasible or prove adequate 
also  some alternative strategies would require the consent of at least a majority in interest of the lenders under our senior credit facility  the holders of our senior subordinated notes and the holders of our senior discount debentures  and we can provide no assurances that we would be able to obtain this consent 
if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations and alternative strategies are unsuccessful or unavailable  our lenders would be entitled to exercise various remedies  including foreclosing on our assets 
under those circumstances  our investors may lose all or a portion of their investments 
the covenants governing our debt impose significant restrictions on us 
the terms of our amended senior credit facility and the indentures for our senior subordinated notes and senior discount debentures impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests 
these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions  including incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness  paying dividends or making distributions or certain other restricted payments  making capital expenditures and other investments  creating liens on our assets  issuing or selling capital stock of our subsidiaries  transferring or selling assets currently held by us  repurchasing stock and certain indebtedness  engaging in transactions with affiliates  entering into any agreements that restrict dividends from our subsidiaries  and engaging in mergers or consolidations 
the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our indentures and other debt agreements 
furthermore  our senior credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including establishing a maximum leverage ratio and requiring us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and a funded senior debt to current assets ratio  which  if not maintained by us  will cause us to be in default under our senior credit facility 
any of these defaults  if not waived  could result in the acceleration of all of our debt  in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable 
if this occurs  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if new financing were available  it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our long term debt 
while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our debt  exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of outstanding balances on our senior discount debentures and senior subordinated notes 
our variable rate debt relates to borrowings under our senior credit facility 
our variable rate debt is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor  prime  federal funds and base cd rates 
our future exposure to interest rate risk decreased during due to decreased interest rates and reduced variable rate debt 
additionally  during  we entered into a hedge agreement in the form of a zero cost collar  which will protect against interest rate fluctuations in the libor rate on million of our variable rate debt 
the collar consists of an interest rate ceiling of and an interest rate floor of for a term of twenty four months 
under this hedge agreement  we continue to pay interest at prevailing rates plus any spread  as defined by our credit facility  but are reimbursed for any amounts paid on the libor rate in excess of the ceiling 
accordingly  we are 
table of contents required to pay the financial institution that originated the collar if the libor rate is less than the floor 
in march and in conjunction with the restatement and amending of our senior credit facility  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements on an aggregate of million of our variable rate debt 
the first swap allows us to fix our libor rate at thereby limiting our cash flow risk on million of debt for a term of months 
the remaining swap allows us to fix our libor rate at limiting our cash flow risk on an additional million of debt for a term of months
