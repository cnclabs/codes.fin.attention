critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  some of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
our accounting policies are generally straightforward  but inventory valuation requires more significant management judgments and estimates 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
cost is calculated using the retail inventory method 
the retail inventory method is used to estimate the ending inventory at cost by employing a cost to retail selling price ratio 
the ending inventory is first determined at selling price and then converted to cost 
purchases  sales  net markdowns less mark ups  charity  discounts and estimated shrink are considered in arriving at the cost to retail ratio 
inventories include items that have been marked down to management s best estimate of their fair market value 
management s decision to mark down merchandise is based on maintaining the freshness of our product offering 
markdowns are taken regularly to effect the rapid sale of slow moving inventory and to make room for new merchandise arriving daily to the stores 
to the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may be required that could reduce our gross margin  operating income and carrying value of inventories 
our success is largely dependent on our ability to anticipate the changing fashion tastes of our customers and to respond to those changing tastes in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changing styles  trends or brand preferences of our customers  we may experience lower sales  excess inventories and more frequent and extensive markdowns which would adversely affect our operating results 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
our accounting policies and estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
current trends and outlook sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal continued to be weak in all three divisions with continued declining comparable store sales following the lower than expected results of the third quarter 
the holiday selling season for fiscal did not meet our expectations 
there was no dominant fashion trend driving sales  compared to fiscal starting with the back to school season  we were not able to capitalize on a fashion trend to replace the bohemian style apparel  which was the dominant fashion trend for spring of fiscal we have made substantial efforts to evaluate our key customers in the wet seal division  and concluded that our wet seal division focused on a sophisticated product line while girls and young women were gravitating toward a more basic and junior look 
the initial stages of the wet seal division s change in presentation to reach out to its customers and carry basics are reflected in its spring assortment 
our gross margins during the second through fourth quarters were further eroded by the large amount of markdowns necessary to move the poor performing merchandise in order to make room for new receipts 
this was especially true during the fourth quarter  including a write down of inventory at year end through a mark out of stock process 
we are also evaluating our cost structure  given the disappointing results for fiscal cost saving strategies are being developed and implemented 
we recently reduced our staffing levels  and plan to continue this process by eliminating positions where practical 
other cost saving initiatives are also under way to reduce selling  general and administrative and distribution and buying costs 
during fiscal  we anticipate opening fewer stores than originally anticipated  with approximately new locations  consisting of arden b 
locations  zutopia location with the remainder of the openings being wet seal locations 
total capital expenditures anticipated for fiscal are now expected to be less than million 
this capital expenditure estimate includes the anticipated costs of renovating stores whose leases will expire but that we expect to renew 
results of operations fiscal and consisted of the week periods ended february  and february   respectively and fiscal consisted of the week period ended february  comparable store sales are defined as sales in stores that were open at least months 
the following table sets forth selected income statement data expressed as a percent of sales for the years indicated as a percentage of sales fiscal year ended fiscal year fiscal year ended february  february  february  net sales cost of sales including buying  distribution and occupancy costs gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended february  
sales in fiscal were million compared to sales for fiscal of million  an increase of million  or 
the dollar increase in sales was due to the net increase of stores  stores were open and operating at the end of fiscal compared to stores at the end of fiscal comparable store sales decreased for fiscal compared to an increase of for fiscal the comparable store sales decrease reflected the negative sales trends in the second half of fiscal  which did not have a dominant fashion trend to drive sales as compared to fiscal sales in the first half of fiscal were fueled by the bohemian trend 
as the bohemian trend waned during the period leading up to the back to school season  we had a more sophisticated product offering  while we believe our competitors were gaining ground with a more basic presentation 
cost of sales  including buying  distribution and occupancy costs  was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
cost of sales was of sales for fiscal  compared to of sales in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in cost of sales as a percent of sales for fiscal was driven by an increase in markdowns and in shrink  offset partially by a slight improvement in the cumulative mark up 
the increased markdowns in the third and fourth quarters were the result of reacting to the declining comparable store sales  and included a substantial markdown reserve at year end to reduce the value of inventory marked out of stock in february in addition  the de leverage stemming from negative comparable store sales caused fixed costs such as buying  distribution and occupancy to rise as a percentage of sales in fiscal  versus fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales in fiscal  above the of sales for fiscal the increase in selling expenses was primarily due to higher store wages and benefits 
this was due to supporting more stores as well as actions taken early in the year to improve the quality and therefore the average salary of many of the store level employees 
the catalog business also contributed to higher selling expenses for the promotion  production and distribution support costs  reflecting our entry into the catalog business in fiscal in addition  we have incurred higher advertising costs in fiscal to support the retail locations 
the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily caused by a reserve established for costs we expect to incur relating to kathy bronstein s employment status 
the remaining increase was due to central office payrolls  reflecting salary increases and an increase in the number of employees  offset partially by savings in legal fees incurred in negotiating store leases as a result of establishing an in house legal department 
selling  general and administrative expenses rose  as a percent of sales  due to de leveraging of fixed costs caused by lower sales per store than in the same stores in the prior year 
interest income  net  was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
this decrease was due to a reduction in market interest rates on the invested balances  as well as a drop later in the year in the amount invested 
total cash and investments were million at the end of fiscal  compared to million at fiscal the income tax provision was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal  was compared to in fiscal this decrease reflected the net loss during the fourth quarter  which increased the proportion of the full year net income that was in the form of tax exempt interest  as well as the proportion of income offset by charitable deductions of merchandise 
based on the factors noted above  net income was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of sales  net income was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended february  
sales in fiscal were million for the week fiscal year compared to sales in fiscal of million for the week fiscal year  an increase of million  or 
on a pro forma basis  comparing the week period ended february  to the week period ended january   the increase in sales would have been million  or 
the dollar increase in sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the impact of new store openings and the acquisition of stores in fiscal the increase in sales was also due to the increase in comparable store sales of for the weeks ended february  compared to the weeks ended january  these increases were somewhat offset by the closing of stores in fiscal cost of sales  including buying  distribution and occupancy costs  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales related primarily to an increase in the initial mark up over the prior year and a decrease in markdowns from the prior year 
we also experienced a decrease in occupancy costs due to the leverage on landlord expenses resulting from an increase in comparable store sales and due to a decrease in distribution costs resulting from lower depreciation as the original distribution equipment was fully depreciated in the prior year 
offsetting the overall decrease in cost of sales was an increase in buying costs 
the increase in buying costs was due to additional headcount added to support new divisions and to further augment current infrastructure 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to an increase in advertising costs related to the use of print media campaigns and a television sponsorship not used in the prior year 
the increase is also due to an increase in selling wages in an effort to improve customer service 
delivery charges increased due to the change in the freight strategy to use three day air in fiscal versus the use of ground transportation in fiscal interest income  net  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million 
this increase was due primarily to an increase in the average cash balance invested during the year offset in part by lower interest rates during fiscal versus fiscal the income tax provision was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the apportionment among various states  resulting in lower effective state tax rates 
based on the factors noted above  net income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of sales  net income was in fiscal compared to in fiscal liquidity and capital resources working capital at the end of fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in working capital of million in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in cash and short term investments  net of reductions in construction payables  merchandise payables  and an income tax payable in the prior year compared to an income tax receivable in the current year 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was largely the result of lower net income of million  offset slightly by million in non cash depreciation expense increase 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities  whose balance changes increased cash flow by nearly million in fiscal  dropped nearly million during fiscal this shift reflects nearly million less in accrued construction costs at the end of fiscal compared to fiscal  and million more in net owned inventory at the end of fiscal compared to fiscal finally  there was an increase of approximately million from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal in other receivables due to an income tax receivable of million  reflecting the drop in income in the latter part of fiscal in fiscal  and  we invested million  million and million  respectively  in property and equipment and leasehold improvements 
these expenditures related primarily to new store openings and remodels 
in fiscal  we opened stores and remodeled stores 
there were no acquisitions in fiscal in fiscal  we opened stores  remodeled stores and we acquired the leases  merchandise inventory and furniture and fixtures of zutopia stores from gymboree  inc for million 
capital expenditures for fiscal are currently projected to be million or less  relating primarily to planned new store openings  remodels and minor store renovations  as well as implementing a planning and allocation system and other key store support programs 
in september  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock 
from this authorized plan   shares split adjusted were repurchased at a cost of million 
these repurchased shares were reflected as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheets  until they were retired on december   as authorized by the board of directors 
on october   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our outstanding class a common stock 
this amount included the remaining shares previously authorized for repurchase by the board of directors 
during october  we repurchased  shares under the new repurchase plan for million 
these repurchased shares under the new plan were immediately retired as authorized by our board of directors 
as of the end of fiscal  there were approximately million shares remaining for future repurchases under the october  authorization 
as of the date of this report  all treasury shares have been retired 
we have a revolving line of credit arrangement with bank of america  na in an aggregate principal amount of million  maturing on july  at february   there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit arrangement  and there were million open letters of credit related to imported inventory orders and an insurance standby letter of credit for million 
as of the date of this report we are in compliance with all financial covenants of the credit arrangement 
we invest our excess funds in short term investment grade money market funds  investment grade commercial paper and us treasury and agency obligations 
the long term marketable securities consist of high credit quality municipal and corporate bonds 
we believe that our working capital and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements in the foreseeable future 
seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal by nature with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending the first week of september  historically accounting for the largest percentage of sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of approximately of our annual sales  after adjusting for sales increases related to new stores 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the past three years 
however  we cannot assure you that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
commitments and contingencies our principal contractual obligations consist of minimum annual rental commitments under non cancelable leases  including our corporate office  warehouse facility  automobiles  computer equipment and copiers 
at february   our contractual obligations under these leases were as follows in thousands contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases our principal commercial commitments consist primarily of open letters of credit  related to imported inventory orders  secured by our revolving line of credit arrangement

in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs

accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of either by sale or other than by sale 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
we adopted the provisions of sfas for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirement of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have determined not to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation but have adopted the additional disclosure requirements of sfas in fiscal in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and  and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we believe the adoption of such interpretation will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position and we intend to adopt the recognition provisions of such interpretation on february   as required 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin no 
requires that variable interest entities be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin no 
also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that companies are not required to consolidate but in which a company has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
will apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements will apply to entities established prior to january  in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  the disclosure requirements will apply in all financial statements issued after january  we believe the adoption of fin no 
will have no impact on our results of operations or financial position  as we have no interests in variable interest entities
