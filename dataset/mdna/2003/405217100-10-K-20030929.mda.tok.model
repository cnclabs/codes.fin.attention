on january   we acquired fruit chips bv  a netherlands based company  who manufactures  distributes and markets low fat fruit  vegetable and potato chips 
all of the foregoing acquisitions the acquisitions or acquired businesses have been accounted for as purchases 
consequently  the operations of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition 
results of operations restructuring and non recurring charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded charges aggregating million  before taxes  related to the expected sale of the manufacturing assets of our health valley facility in irwindale  california million and the discontinuance of our supplements business million and weight watchers licenses million 
approximately million of these charges were non cash in nature 
during the second half of  we decided to pursue and execute a plan to sell the health valley irwindale plant 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell the manufacturing assets of the facility to a co packer 
our decision to dispose of this facility was largely the result of our inability to reach practical capacity at the facility 
accordingly  we identified a co packer who can produce our products and bring more production into the plant by offering other branded and private label companies the opportunity to have their products manufactured by the co packer 
this agreement went into effect on october  and currently we purchase our products from this co packer on a cost plus basis 
this pricing structure was not expected to provide us with any immediate increase in margins  but allows us to share in the potential operating efficiencies of the plant through reduced product pricing in our cost plus arrangement when and if the co packer brings more production into the plant 
as of june   with the expected sale of all plant assets and certain inventories to this co packer  we recorded this restructuring and non recurring charge 
the charge included million of charges associated with reduced values of inventories of raw ingredients and packaging  certain lease obligations and other items  none of which included employee severance costs 
of this million of charges  our gross profit was reduced by million charged to cost of sales as required by accounting rules 
at june  approximately million of future costs were accrued  principally related to lease exit costs 
in addition  we recorded million of impairment charges to reduce the health valley plant s manufacturing assets to their net realizable values 
additional restructuring charges of approximately 
million were incurred during the year ended june  for severance liabilities and related employee costs and trade items that could not be accrued at june  in addition  at the time of lease termination in fiscal  we were able to reduce our potential lease exit costs by 
million  which was recorded as a credit to restructuring and other non recurring charges 
through june   approximately million was charged against the health valley facility charge accrual in the aggregate 
in june  we announced that we had discontinued our supplements business at celestial seasonings  and that we would not renew our license to sell certain weight watchers products 
these product lines did not represent our core product category of natural and organic foods  and further  the supplements business had faced increasing competition over the last few years along with reduced consumer interest 
our operating results and financial position have been only minimally enhanced in fiscal without these non core product lines 
in addition  we can now better utilize our management resources away from these non core product lines 
in connection with these discontinuances  we recorded charges of million related to supplements  principally for inventories  packaging and trade items 
of this million charge  million had the effect of reducing our gross profit 
the charge for the non renewal of the weight watchers license amounted to million  principally for inventories  packaging and trade items  of which 
million reduced our gross profit 
approximately million had been accrued at june  associated with these future costs 
at june   it was determined that million of the accruals for sales returns and other trade incentives would no longer be required and  therefore  such amount was reversed 
through june   approximately million has been charged against these accruals in the aggregate 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in were million  an increase of over net sales of million in the increase in sales came principally from the net sales of businesses acquired in as well as from the full year of our operation of businesses acquired in net sales in were favorably impacted by the normal winter weather across the united states after the unusually warm winter of the prior year  which provided higher unit sales volumes for tea  soups and hot cereals while the net sales of our terra chips products experienced declines during the year caused principally by weaker frites and red bliss sales 
our sales were favorably impacted by approximately due to the weaker us dollar 
gross profit in increased to million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the gross profit adjusted for the restructuring and non recurring charges in that year was million  or of net sales 
the improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales in came from more efficient trade spending as a percentage of sales and improvements in our delivery and warehousing costs as a percentage of sales  offset by higher ingredient costs and the lower gross profits associated with businesses acquired in europe 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million  in from million in the increase in spending in selling  general and administrative expenses came principally from million of costs brought on by businesses acquired in as well as from the full year of our operation of businesses acquired in  
million of increased consumer marketing  and increases across all levels of general and administrative expenses to support our growing business 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in to from in this decrease was caused principally by the increase in sales at a faster rate than the increase in general and administrative costs as we leverage the infrastructure in place as we acquire additional new businesses and add them to existing infrastructures  particularly in the united states 
operating income increased to million in from million in the amount was reduced by the restructuring and non recurring charges of million in that year 
the increase in operating income came from the elimination of those charges  and from the higher level of sales and gross profits  offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses  all discussed above 
interest and other expenses  net  decreased to million in from million in this decrease is principally comprised of an increase in interest expense by approximately 
million in  such increase coming from the increased borrowings during to fund the three acquisitions of businesses we made during the year  offset by the elimination of the million charge we incurred in when we closed the terra chips former manufacturing facility in brooklyn  ny 
income before income taxes increased to million in from million in this increase is the result of the aforementioned increase in operating income and the overall reduction of interest and other expenses  net 
income taxes increased to million in from million in our effective tax rate was in compared to in the small reduction in our effective tax rate came principally from the departure of our terra chips manufacturing facility from new york city and the resulting elimination of the related local income taxes 
net income for amounted to million compared to million in this million increase in net income is primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in income before income taxes offset by the increase in income tax expense 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal were million  an increase of over net sales of million in adjusted for sales derived from acquired businesses and a continuation of the redirection of management focus from certain non core product lines principally supplements and non core food product categories  our net sales increased 
our net sales were impacted during fiscal by the tragic events of september   the unusually warm winter which slowed sales of teas and other cold weather products  and product availability issues affecting our terra chips products caused first by capacity limitations at our original brooklyn  new york plant and further by the delays in the start up of production at our moonachie  new jersey plant 
our internal growth was derived principally from our terra and garden of eatin snack brands and from our refrigerated westsoy brand 
gross profit for decreased by million to million of net sales as compared to million of net sales in gross profits in adjusted for the restructuring and non recurring charges discussed above were million  or of reported net sales 
the decline in adjusted gross profit percentage of was caused by changes in the mix of sales driven principally by unusually warm winter weather million or  higher than anticipated start up production costs at our new terra chips manufacturing facility in moonachie million or  higher freight and warehousing costs associated with certain strategic initiatives to increase inventory levels in order to reduce stock outs with the objective of increasing customer satisfaction million or  and lower gross profits associated with certain of our recent business acquisitions 
million or 
selling  general and administrative expenses excluding amortization expense increased by approximately million to million of net sales in as compared to of net sales in the increase is a result of million of costs brought on by the aforementioned acquisitions during the second half of fiscal and first half of fiscal  million of increased consumer marketing  million of higher depreciation associated with continuing improvements to our information systems and the capital expenditures related to our headquarters office relocation  and increases across all levels of general and administrative costs to support the growing infrastructure required for our business 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was million for compared to approximately 
million for the results for include the effect of adopting statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which resulted in a million reduction in overall expenses million net of tax and a 
increase in basic and diluted earnings per share 
the million pre tax reduction of amortization expense in represents the amount of amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets that arose from acquisitions prior to july  and is no longer being amortized 
as discussed above  during we recorded million of restructuring and other non recurring charges  and a million impairment of long lived assets charge 
there were no such charges in these charges are related to certain asset write offs  trade costs and employee severance costs associated with the discontinuance of the celestial seasonings supplements business and weight watchers brand license and the expected health valley facility sale 
merger related charges amounted to million for  resulting from certain employee costs associated with the celestial seasonings merger in may operating income decreased to million during compared to million in the decrease of million is due to the aforementioned restructuring and non recurring charges of million  decreased gross profits and higher selling  general and administrative expenses  all discussed above 
interest expense income net  and other expenses amounted to expense of million in compared with income of million in the decrease of million is primarily the result of the interest expense we incurred in while using our credit facility as compared to the interest we earned in on the investible cash we had during that year 
since june  we have used that cash to fund the yves and lima acquisitions  and to fund the construction of our new terra chips manufacturing facility in moonachie  new jersey 
in addition  in we incurred a full year of carrying costs for our credit facility  which we entered into on march  in  we also incurred other costs and expenses totaling million resulting from the closure of our terra chips brooklyn  ny manufacturing facility in december  and the return of the leased premises to the owner 
we disposed of machinery and equipment and leasehold improvements deemed unusable which totaled million  and we were required to retrofit the leased brooklyn facility to its original condition at a cost of approximately 
million 
income before income taxes decreased million to million in as compared to million in the decrease is a result of the aforementioned decrease in operating income and higher interest and other costs 
income taxes decreased to million for compared to million in the effective tax rate was in compared to in the reason for our lower tax rate was the elimination of nondeductible goodwill amortization discussed above 
net income for amounted to million compared to million in this million decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to the aforementioned decrease in income before income taxes offset by the reduction in income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations and growth primarily with the cash flows we generate from our operations and from borrowings under our credit facility 
we have available to us a million revolving credit facility the credit facility which provides us with a million revolving credit facility through march   and a million renewable day facility through march  the credit facility is unsecured  but is guaranteed by all of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries 
we are required to comply with customary affirmative and negative covenants for facilities of this nature 
this access to capital provides us with flexible working capital needs in the normal course of business and the opportunity to grow our business through acquisitions or develop our existing infrastructure through capital investment 
net cash provided by operations was million and million for and  respectively 
our working capital and current ratio were million and to  respectively  at june  compared with million and to respectively  at june  our improvement in working capital was derived principally from the net income earned during the year ended june net cash provided by financing activities was million for during  we borrowed cash to fund the three acquisitions made during the year 
net cash used in financing activities was million for during  we repaid certain debt obligations of acquired businesses totaling million and we used million of cash for a stock buyback program 
during the year ended june   we acquired 
million shares of our common stock in open market purchases at a cost of approximately million 
obligations for all debt instruments  capital and operating leases and other contractual obligations are as follows payments due by period less than total year years thereafter debt instruments     capital lease obligations    operating leases     total contractual cash obligations     we believe that cash on hand of million at june   as well as projected fiscal cash flows from operations  and availability under our credit facility are sufficient to fund our working capital needs  anticipated capital expenditures of approximately million  and the million of debt and lease obligations described in the table above  during the next fiscal year 
we currently invest our cash on hand in highly liquid short term investments yielding approximately interest 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the accounting principles we use require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented 
we believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting policies  however  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using assumptions different from those that we have consistently applied 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as follows  including our methodology for estimates made and assumptions used valuation of accounts and chargebacks receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations on existing and new customers daily 
we apply reserves for delinquent or uncollectible trade receivables based on a specific identification methodology and also apply a general reserve based on the experience we have with our trade receivables aging categories 
credit losses have been within our expectations over the last few years 
while two of our customers represent approximately of our trade receivable balance at june   we believe there is no credit exposure at this time 
based on cash collection history and other statistical analysis  we estimate the amount of unauthorized deductions that our customers have taken to be repaid and collectible in the near future in the form of a chargeback receivable 
while our estimate of this receivable balance could be different had we used different assumptions and judgments  historically our cash collections of this type of receivable have been within our expectations and no significant write offs have occurred  however  during the fourth quarter of  we reduced our chargebacks receivable by million 
our chargebacks receivable balance at june was million as compared to million at june there can be no assurance that we would have the same experience with our receivables during different economic conditions  or with changes in business conditions  such as consolidation within the food industry and or a change the way we market and sell our products 
inventory our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost has been derived principally using standard costs utilizing the first in  first out method 
we provide write downs for finished goods expected to become non saleable due to age and specifically identify and reserve for slow moving or obsolete raw ingredients and packaging 
property  plant and equipment our property  plant and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful lives or lease life  whichever is shorter 
we believe the asset lives assigned to our property  plant and equipment are within ranges guidelines generally used in food manufacturing and distribution businesses 
our manufacturing plants and distribution centers  and their related assets  are periodically reviewed to determine if any impairment exists by analyzing underlying cash flow projections 
at this time  we believe no impairment exists on the carrying value of such assets 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
intangibles goodwill is no longer amortized and the value of an identifiable intangible asset is amortized over its useful life unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life 
the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment 
revenue recognition and sales incentives sales are recognized upon the shipment of finished goods to customers and are reported net of sales incentives 
allowances for cash discounts and returns are recorded in the period in which the related sale is recognized 
shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales 
supplementary quarterly financial data unaudited quarterly financial data in thousands  except per share amounts for fiscal and is summarized as follows three months ended september  december  march  june  net sales     gross profit     restructuring and non recurring charges operating income     income before income taxes     net income     basic earnings per common share 



diluted earnings per common share 



gross profit for the three months ended june  was positively impacted by the following offsetting items a reduction by million of chargebacks receivable from customers  and a million reduction of reserves established last year in connection with similar items included in the charges recorded for supplements and other items 
these offsetting items increased gross profit by million 
three months ended september  december  march  june  net sales     gross profit     restructuring and non recurring charges  impairment of property  plant equipment  operating income loss     income loss before income taxes     net income loss     basic earnings per common share 



diluted earnings per common share 



gross profit for the three months ended june  was negatively impacted by approximately million of charges to cost of sales resulting from the restructuring and non recurring charges related to the expected sale of the health valley manufacturing facility  and the discontinuance of the supplements business and weight watchers license 
seasonality our tea business consists primarily of manufacturing and marketing hot tea products and  as a result  its quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends resulting from increased demand for its hot tea products in the cooler months of the year 
this is also true for our soups and hot cereals businesses  but to a lesser extent 
quarterly fluctuations in our sales volume and operating results are due to a number of factors relating to our business  including the timing of trade promotions  advertising and consumer promotions and other factors  such as seasonality  abnormal and inclement weather patterns and unanticipated increases in labor  commodity  energy  insurance or other operating costs 
the impact on sales volume and operating results  due to the timing and extent of these factors  can significantly impact our business 
for these reasons  you should not rely on our quarterly operating results as indications of future performance 
in some future periods  our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could harm our business 
inflation management does not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are o interest rates on debt and cash equivalents  and o foreign exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses 
interest rates we centrally manage our debt and cash equivalents considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
our cash equivalents consist primarily of commercial paper and obligations of us government agencies 
assuming year end variable debt and cash equivalents levels  a one point change in interest rates would have the effect of increasing our interest expense by approximately 
million  thereby reducing our net income by approximately 
per share 
foreign operations operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause adjustments to our financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales were generated from sales outside the united states  while such sales outside the united states were of net sales in and less than in we expect sales from non core us markets to possibly represent an increasing portion of our total net sales in the future 
our non us sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including o periodic economic downturns and unstable political environments  o price and currency exchange controls  o fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  o unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  and o difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  collecting accounts receivable and managing distributors
