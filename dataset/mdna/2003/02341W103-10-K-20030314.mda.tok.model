item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations describes relevant aspects of the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to select accounting policies that are appropriate for the company s business  and to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain in applying those policies 
on an ongoing basis  the company re evaluates these estimates  judgments and assumptions for reasonableness because of the critical impact that these factors have on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company s management has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which the financial statements are based and that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments 
these policies relate to the valuation of accounts receivable and inventories  the recognition of depreciation and impairment in the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  and accounting for pension benefits 
senior management of the company has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the members of the audit committee of our board of directors 
these accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the discussion which follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
described here are the critical accounting policies of the company valuation of accounts receivable the company provides credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and performs ongoing credit evaluations 
the company s customer base is diverse and includes customers located throughout the world 
payment terms in certain of the foreign countries in which the company does business are longer than those that are customary in the united states  and as a result  may give rise to additional credit risk related to outstanding accounts receivable from these non us customers 
likewise  a change in the financial position  liquidity or prospects of any of the company s customers could have an impact on the company s ability to collect amounts due 
while concentrations of credit risk related to trade receivables are somewhat limited by the company s large customer base  the company does extend significant credit to some of its customers 
the company makes estimates of the amounts of its gross accounts receivable that will not be collectible  and records an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of accounts receivable to the amount that is expected to be realized 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon the company s historical bad debt experience  a review of the overall aging of the accounts  and an analysis of specific customer accounts  particularly those with past due balances 
the recorded allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to cover specific customer collection issues identified by management at the balance sheet date  and to provide for potential losses from other accounts based on the company s historical experience 
increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as an expense and included in general  selling and administrative expenses in the period identified 
the company s estimate of the required allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future collectibility of customer accounts 
inventory valuation inventories are recorded at the lower of actual manufactured or purchased cost  or estimated net realizable value 
in order to determine net realizable value  management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and evaluates significant items to determine whether they are excess or obsolete 
the company records the value of estimated excess or obsolete inventory as a reduction of inventory and as an expense which is included in cost of sales in the period it is identified 
the company s estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future demand for inventory 
in order to quantify excess or obsolete inventory  management prepares lists of inventory quantities on hand and determines the amount of such inventories that  based on projected demand  are not anticipated to be sold within the next to months or  based on our current product offerings  are excess or obsolete 
this list is then reviewed with sales and production management personnel to determine whether this list of potential excess or obsolete inventory is complete 
factors which impact this evaluation include  for example  whether there has been a change in the market or packaging for particular products  and whether there are components of inventory that incorporate obsolete technology 
in certain businesses in which the company is engaged  such as the domestic cat litter business  product and packaging changes can occur rapidly and expose the company to excess and obsolete inventories 
goodwill and long lived assets the company has made substantial investments in property  plant and equipment and has a moderate investment in goodwill 
for property  plant and equipment  the company evaluates the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
for goodwill  the company performs an annual impairment assessment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in analyzing the fair value of goodwill and assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  management uses models which are based on estimates of future operating performance and related cash flows 
in preparing these models  management must make estimates in projecting future cash flows attributable to the reporting unit or assets being tested  in selecting a discount rate that reflects the related business risks  and in determining the appropriate perpetuity or disposal value 
in developing these projections of future cash flows  the company makes a variety of important assumptions and estimates that have a significant impact on management s assessments of whether the carrying values of goodwill and property  plant and equipment should be adjusted to reflect impairment 
among these are assumptions and estimates about the future growth and profitability of the related business unit or asset  and assumptions about anticipated future economic  regulatory and political conditions in the relevant market 
the company s estimates related to the carrying values of goodwill and property  plant and equipment are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they are susceptible to change from period to period based on a variety of factors 
for example  judgment is required to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  in performing assessments of the carrying values of these assets  management is required to make judgments about the future business  economic  regulatory  and political conditions affecting these assets  as well as to select the appropriate risk related rates for discounting estimated future cash flows  and to develop reasonable estimates of disposal values 
retirement benefits the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all of its domestic employees 
in order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these retirement benefits  management must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to value certain liabilities  expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these liabilities  rate of compensation increase  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
the company s benefit plan committee determines the key assumptions related to the discount rate  expected investment rate of return and compensation increases after consulting with the actuarial firm that performs the calculations 
other assumptions are also set based on consultation with the company s actuaries 
the company bases its estimates on its historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances 
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments on the measurement date 
the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date 
an increase in the discount rate reduces pension expense and liabilities 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined using historic market return trends combined with current market conditions 
an increase in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reduces pension expense and liabilities 
the expected rate of compensation increase is determined based on the company s near term outlook and assumed inflation 
higher compensation rate increases increase pension expense and liabilities 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
mortality rates are based on tables published by the insurance industry 
different estimates used by management could result in the company recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time

such forward looking statements include statements relating to the company or its operations that are preceded by terms such as expects  believes  anticipates  intends and similar expressions  and statements relating to anticipated growth  levels of capital expenditures  future dividends  expansion into global markets and the development of new products 
such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from the results  performance or achievements expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including without limitation the following competition minerals 
the minerals market is very competitive 
we believe competition is essentially a matter of product quality  price  delivery  service and technical support 
several of our competitors in the us market are larger and have substantially greater financial resources 
if we fail to compete successfully based on these or other factors  we may lose customers or fail to recruit new customers and our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
reliance on metalcasting and construction industries approximately of our minerals segment s sales and of our environmental segment s sales in were to the metalcasting and construction markets  respectively 
the metalcasting and construction markets depend heavily upon the strength of the domestic and international economies 
if these economies weaken  demand for products by the metalcasting and construction markets may decline and our business or future financial results in the minerals and environmental segments may be adversely affected 
regulatory and legal matters our operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment and to health and safety matters 
substantial penalties may be imposed if we violate certain of these laws and regulations even if the violation was inadvertent or unintentional 
if these laws or regulations are changed or interpreted differently in the future  it may become more difficult or expensive for us to comply 
in addition  investigations or evaluations of our products by government agencies may require us to adopt additional safety measures or precautions 
if our costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future materially increase  our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
the company may also be subject to adverse litigation results in addition to increased compliance costs arising from future changes in laws and regulations that may negatively impact its operations and profits 
risks of international expansion an important part of our business strategy is to expand internationally 
we intend to seek acquisitions  joint ventures and strategic alliances globally 
currently  our business outside the united states represents approximately of our consolidated sales 
the approximate breakdown of the sales outside of the united states for was as follows europe  latin america including mexico  asia  and africa along with the middle east 
as we expand internationally  we will be subject to increased risks  which may include the following o currency exchange or price control laws  o currency translation adjustments  o political and economic instability  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o tariffs and other trade barriers  o longer accounts receivable collection cycles  and o adverse tax consequences 
the above listed events could result in sudden  and potentially prolonged  changes in demand for the company s products 
also  we may have difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting accounts receivable through a foreign country s legal system 
at december   approximately of the gross accounts receivable were due from customers outside of the united states and canada 
the breakdown of the overseas balance was as follows europe  latin america including mexico  asia  and africa and the middle east volatility of stock price the stock market has been extremely volatile in recent years 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  factors such as the following may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock o fluctuations in our financial results  o our introduction of new services or products  o announcements of acquisitions  strategic alliances or joint ventures by us  our customers or our competitors  o changes in analysts recommendations regarding our common stock  and o general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will increase in the future or be maintained at its recent levels
