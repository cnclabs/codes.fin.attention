although the c band market continues to decline  the number of subscribers to the subscription ppv tv group s networks is not declining as quickly  and its average revenue earned per sale has remained relatively stable 
the subscription ppv tv group terminated its third party c band distributor contracts during the year ended march  because management felt the contracts were no longer favorable to the group 
the termination of these contracts was responsible for a decrease in subscriptions to its networks from to the increase in the subscription ppv tv group s cable dbs revenues year over year are a result of launching new services and the addition of addressable subscribers to its networks through affiliations with new cable dbs providers and the online growth of current affiliates

in august  dish moved ten xtsy to its satellite at degrees 
significantly more addressable subscribers view dish s satellite at degrees than its satellite at degrees 
ten xtsy is available on dish as both a subscription and ppv service  as well as part of a monthly combination subscription with ten

internet group net revenue total net revenue for the internet group was million  million  and million for the years ended march   and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and from to the internet group s revenue is comprised of membership revenue from its consumer based web sites  revenue from the sale of its content feeds to webmasters  revenue from the sale of exit traffic  and revenue from its data center services 
net membership revenue was million  million  and million for the years ended march    and  respectively  representing decreases of from to and from to the decline in gross membership revenue from to is a direct result of a decrease in traffic to the internet group s web sites 
the decrease in traffic to the internet group s sites was primarily due to changes made to the group s traffic acquisition model 
the internet group changed its traffic acquisition model during the fiscal year ended march  to compensate an affiliated webmaster for traffic directed to the internet group s web sites only upon the conversion of a referral into a paying member 
prior to this change  the group was paying for traffic based upon the amount of traffic directed to the group s web sites  regardless of whether this traffic resulted in a paying member to one of the group s sites 
this change to the internet group s traffic acquisition programs resulted in a decline in webmaster payouts from to the internet group also believes that its membership revenue and traffic volume declined from due to the proliferation of free adult content available on the internet 
in addition  portals such as microsoft corporation s msn msn  no longer default words typed into a browser dialogue box to the dot com web site associated with such word  and have begun to sell off their adult word searches to outside companies  impacting the amount of type in traffic to the internet group s web sites 
the decline in net membership revenue from to was a result of a continued decline in traffic to the internet group s web sites due to the elimination of all traffic generating programs 
the internet group ceased actively purchasing traffic for its web sites during the fiscal year ended march  instead  the internet group has depended upon its adult domain names to generate traffic to its sites  and has focused on cross selling its flagship web site  www 
ten 
com  on the subscription ppv tv group s networks 
the standard one month membership prices to the group s web sites ranged from to for the fiscal years ended march  and during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march   the internet group decreased the monthly retail price of its flagship web site  www

during the fiscal year ended march  the internet group decreased the number of consumer web sites marketed from to  which also contributed to the decline in net membership revenue year over year 
the decrease in the number of web sites marketed allowed the internet group to ensure that its sites were always updated with new content on a daily weekly basis resulting in an increase in the depth  breadth and relevance of the content included in each site 
revenue is earned from traffic sales by forwarding exit traffic and traffic from selected vanity domains to other affiliated webmaster marketing programs domestically  monetizing foreign traffic via international dialer companies  marketing affiliated webmaster sites through the internet group s double opt in email list  and by directing traffic to its pay per click ppc search engine  www

revenue from the sale of traffic was million  million  and million for the years ended march    and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and from to the internet group experienced a corresponding decrease in revenue from the sale of traffic from to because of a decline in overall traffic purchased by the internet group under its new traffic acquisition model discussed above 
the decline in traffic continued into the fiscal year as the internet group ceased all traffic purchasing programs 
the decline in traffic to the internet group s web sites results in less traffic available to sell both domestically and internationally and less traffic to direct through its ppc search engine 
the internet group changed its methodology for monetizing the exit traffic from its sites ie  traffic that comes through its web sites and does not convert into a paying member during the fiscal year ended march  instead of selling its traffic to affiliated webmasters  the internet group directed its exiting consumers to its own ppc search engine 
the ppc search engine allowed the internet group to monetize its exit traffic by auctioning off keyword searches to advertisers that prepaid for placement within the search engine 
this resulted in a pure market model for the advertiser 
the more the advertiser bid for the keyword  the higher their site was shown in the list of search results returned to the consumer 
the result for the advertiser was qualified traffic that was more likely to convert into a paying member  while the consumer received immediate access to relevant results 
in addition to revenue from its ppc search engine  the internet group s sale of traffic revenue also included revenue from the marketing of its double opt in email program 
revenue was earned by selling email campaigns to customers that were marketed to the group s million opt in email users 
email campaigns were sold on a cost per click or cost per acquisition basis 
revenue from the sale of content was million  million  and million for the years ended march    and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and from to the decrease in revenue from the sale of content is a result of a softening in demand for content by third party webmasters 
webmasters are decreasing their reliance on outside sources for content and demanding lower prices for the content that they purchase 
during the fiscal year ended march  the internet group focused more of its efforts on this revenue stream by hiring a dedicated sales team  establishing a fixed matrix of competitive prices for its products  creating new content offerings  ensuring current content products were updated on a timely basis  and establishing a billing and collection process that required prepayment for its products 
despite these efforts  the continued reluctance on the behalf of webmasters to pay for content makes this a difficult market segment to compete in for the internet group 
the internet group s other revenue was earned from the sale of services such as hosting  co location and bandwidth management isp services to non affiliated companies 
the group s other revenue was  million  and million for the years ended march    and the decrease in revenue from to is a result of the internet group s non affiliated customers changing service providers 
during the fiscal year ended march   the internet group ceased selling its isp services to outside customers and focused its data center operations solely on its internal needs 
cost of sales cost of sales for the internet group was million  million  and million for the years ended march    and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and from to cost of sales consists of variable expenses associated with credit card fees  bandwidth  traffic acquisition costs purchase of traffic  web site content costs and depreciation of assets related to the internet group s data center operations 
cost of sales  as a percentage of revenue  was   and for the years ended march    and  respectively 
approximately of the traffic to the internet group s web sites was acquired through affiliate programs marketed to webmasters 
these programs compensated webmasters for traffic referrals to the internet group s web sites 
a webmaster was paid a fee of per referral that resulted in a paying monthly membership to one of the internet group s web sites 
the internet group s traffic acquisition costs also included payments made to affiliated webmasters for the acquisition of email addresses as part of its double opt in email program 
the internet group discontinued paying for traffic to its sites and the acquisition of email addresses during the year ended march  because it determined  based on analyzing conversion rates and retention rates  that this traffic was not profitable

the decline in traffic acquisition costs from to is primarily due to changes made to the group s traffic acquisition model 
the internet group changed is traffic acquisition model during fiscal to compensate an affiliated webmaster for traffic directed to the internet group s web sites only upon the conversion of a referral into a paying member 
prior to this change  the group was paying for traffic based upon the amount of traffic directed to the group s web sites  regardless of whether this traffic resulted in a paying member to one of the group s sites 
the decline in traffic acquisition costs from to is a result of the internet group s decision to completely cease marketing its traffic acquisition programs 
merchant banking fees  including fees for credits and chargebacks  were million  million  and million for the years ended march    and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and from to merchant banking fees were   and of net membership revenue for the years ended march    and  respectively 
the increase in merchant banking fees as a percentage of net membership revenue is a direct result of the internet group outsourcing its credit card processing and customer service functions to a third party 
the internet group outsourced these functions during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march  this increase in merchant banking fees as a percentage of net membership revenue is offset by a decrease in payroll associated with the termination of its own in house customer service and credit card processing functions 
bandwidth costs were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  representing decreases of from to and from to the decrease in bandwidth costs is a result of the renegotiation of bandwidth contracts with each of the internet group s providers and a decrease in the amount of bandwidth used as a result of a decline in traffic to its web sites 
the internet group expects to see a further decline in this cost due to new contracts negotiated with its bandwidth providers in conjunction with the move of its in house data center to boulder  colorado 
operational expenses  the majority of which relates to depreciation and amortization of internet equipment and domain names  were million  million and million for the years ended march    and  respectively  representing a increase from to and a decrease from to the increase in operational expenses from to is primarily related to increases in operating lease costs  maintenance costs  and depreciation expense related to data center equipment purchases and the build out of the internet group s data center facility 
the decrease in operational costs from to is attributable to the write off of excess equipment during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended march  which related to the relocation of the internet group s data center from los angeles to boulder  and impaired assets written off during the same time period see restructuring expenses and asset impairment charges below 
operating income loss operating income loss for the internet group was an operating loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  and operating income of million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively  representing decreases of from to and from to operating income is declining primarily as a result of lower revenues and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenue 
operating expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended march    and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and from to operating expenses were   and of net revenue for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the decrease in operating expenses from to was attributable to a decrease in bad debt expense from million in to million in and a decline in personnel costs during the fiscal year related to the elimination of certain positions and the elimination of bonuses paid to employees 
the decrease in operating expenses from to was related to a the elimination of the internet group s in house customer service and credit card processing functions  b a decrease in payroll  benefits  and facility costs related to the restructuring and relocation of the sales  marketing  engineering and web development departments to boulder  colorado  c a decrease in trade show related costs  and d a decrease in travel related costs 
future outlook for the internet group in connection with the settlement with edward bonn see legal proceedings  the internet group transferred to mr 
bonn approximately of its domain names 
as a result of this transfer  as of march   the internet group merged all of its dial up web sites and corresponding members into its premiere broadband site  www 
ten 
com 
the transfer of these urls  coupled with the already declining traffic to its sites as a result of the internet group s decision to cease purchasing traffic  has resulted in a substantial decrease in new monthly members to its web site 
the internet group expects to see continued declines in its monthly recurring membership revenue as it is primarily marketing this site only on the subscription ppv tv group s networks 
the traffic generated from this effort is not enough to sustain its membership revenue base 
consequently  the internet group continues to experience a decline in its renewing membership base each month 
however  it is important to note that the internet group does not consider the monthly membership model to be the focus of its future growth plans 
the recurring monthly membership model on the internet is too competitive  there are no barriers to entry  it is too dependent upon credit card processing  and it is very difficult to attract profitable traffic to a web site 
also because of this decline in traffic  the internet group has terminated its ppc search engine and sale of traffic email marketing revenue streams see restructuring expenses below as of march  although the ppc search engine is a viable business model  the internet group does not have the traffic volume to support this business in a profitable manner 
going forward  the internet group will be focusing its efforts on forming revenue sharing partnerships with third party gatekeepers such as cable companies  hospitality providers and portals  whereby it can gain direct access to consumers in search of adult entertainment 
the internet group executed its first such revenue sharing agreement with on command during the fiscal year ended march  under the terms of the agreement  the internet group will be the exclusive provider of adult content for on command s tv internet service 
the internet group is providing a customized version of its www 
ten

in addition  the internet group vacated its office facilities in sherman oaks  california that were being utilized by these functions 
as a result of these measures the company saved approximately million in payroll  benefits  facility costs and other operating expenses

asset impairment the internet group recognized impairment losses on certain urls of approximately million during the fiscal year ended march  management identified certain conditions  including a declining gross margin due to the availability of free adult content on the internet and decreased traffic to the internet group s urls  as indicators of asset impairment 
these conditions led to operating results and forecasted future results that were substantially less than had been anticipated at the time of the company s acquisition of the internet group 
the company revised its projections and determined that the projected results would not fully support the future amortization of the urls associated with the internet group 
in accordance with the company s policy  management assessed the recoverability of the urls using a cash flow projection based on the remaining amortization period of two to four years 
based on this projection  the cumulative cash flow over the remaining amortization periods was insufficient to fully recover the intangible asset balance

the increase in these expenses was offset by a decline in the company s legal fees 
the increase in corporate administration expenses from to is primarily due to an increase in legal fees related to the company s lawsuit filed against edward bonn  bradley weber  jerry howard  and response telemedia  inc see legal proceedings these lawsuits have been settled and there will be no ongoing costs associated with them  a increase in general insurance and directors and officers insurance premiums  the addition of fees paid to the company s outside board members  and a increase in expenses related to the proxy fight that the company defended itself against public relations  printing and postage 
the increase in these expenses was offset by a decrease in payroll and benefit costs due to the elimination of several senior manager positions and a decrease in travel costs 
the company estimates that approximately million of its corporate administration expenses related to the proxy fight and its lawsuit with edward bonn  bradley weber  jerry howard and response telemedia  inc and will  therefore  be nonrecurring for its fiscal year 
other income expense other income expense was expense of million  income of million  and expense of million for the years ended march    and  respectively 
other income expense for the fiscal years ended march  and includes a nonrecurring item related to the legal reserve established for the jp lipson lawsuit lipson lawsuit 
the company was a defendant in a lawsuit filed on january  in which jp lipson sought to enforce an alleged agreement with the company 
on september   a jury entered a verdict awarding to the plaintiff million in liquidated damages and  in the alternative  million in actual damages and million in punitive damages 
subsequent to this verdict  the boulder district court entered an order granting the company s motion to reduce the actual damages against the company from million to million  thereby reducing mr 
lipson s total award  exclusive of interest  to million 
for the year ended march   the company established a reserve on its books for these damages in the amount of million 
since the company already had a portion of this reserve booked subsequent to the fiscal year  the total amount expensed in connection with this reserve during the year ended march  was million 
during the third quarter of its fiscal year ended march   the company announced that it had settled the lipson lawsuit in its entirety for a lump sum payment of  made to his attorneys 
for the year ended march   the company reversed the remaining million of its legal reserve 
other income expense for the fiscal years ended march   and include items related to an agreement entered into with metro global media  inc metro 
in july  the company entered into an agreement with metro in which it received  shares of metro common stock for services it was to provide 
the market value of this stock on the date of the transaction was per share 
during the fiscal year ended march   the stock was delisted from the nasdaq  it began trading on the over the counter market  and its value declined to per share 
due to the permanent impairment in the value of the stock at that time  the company wrote the stock down to a value of  and took a non cash loss of  the company recognized million in other revenue during the fiscal year ended march   in connection with metro releasing the company from its obligations to perform services under the contract signed in july  for which the company was given the  shares of metro stock 
at the time the contract was signed  the company recognized deferred revenue in the amount of million  the fair market value of the metro stock on that date 
since that time  the company had amortized this deferred revenue over months for services it was providing to metro 
the company ceased providing services to metro and metro released the company from its obligation of providing any future services 
accordingly  the remaining deferred revenue was considered earned and was recognized during the fiscal year ended march  in the amount of million 
during the fiscal year ended march   the metro stock ceased trading on the over the counter market and the company wrote off the remaining  deferred taxes sfas  accounting for income taxes requires  among other things  the separate recognition  measured at currently enacted tax rates  of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
a valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all or a portion will not be realized 
the company routinely evaluates its recorded deferred tax assets to determine whether it is still more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 
as of march   the company estimated that it had million in net operating loss carryforwards 
based on its recent history of operating profits at that time and the expected profitability of the company in future periods  the company provided a valuation allowance of for its deferred tax assets and recognized the tax benefit of million based on the company concluding that it was more likely than not that the full benefit of its deferred tax assets would be realized in future years 
during the third quarter of the fiscal year ended march   the company determined that it was more likely than not that sufficient taxable income would not be generated in future years to fully realize its deferred tax assets 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in the amount of million was reflected in the financial statements for that quarter 
as of march   the company had accumulated net operating losses of million and its valuation allowance increased by million to reflect additional tax losses generated during the year 
if the company generates future taxable income against which these tax assets may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding increase in net income would be reported in future periods 
internal revenue code section places a limitation on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards when an ownership change  as defined in the tax law  occurs 
generally  an ownership change occurs when there is a greater than percent change in ownership 
if such a change should occur  the actual utilization of the company s net operating loss carryforwards  for tax purposes  would be limited annually to a percentage of the fair market value of the company at the time of such change 
critical accounting policies new frontier media s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation allowances  goodwill impairment  and prepaid distribution rights content licensing 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues for the subscription ppv tv group are primarily related to the sale of our network services to cable dbs affiliates 
the cable affiliates do not report actual monthly sales for each of their systems to the subscription ppv tv group until days after the month of service ends 
this practice requires management to make monthly revenue estimates based on the subscription ppv tv group s historical experience for each affiliated system 
revenue is subsequently adjusted to reflect the actual amount earned upon receipt by the subscription ppv tv group 
adjustments made to adjust revenue from estimated to actual have historically been immaterial 
the recognition of revenues for both the subscription ppv tv and internet groups is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
valuation allowances we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for both the subscription ppv tv and internet groups 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event new frontier media were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should new frontier media determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
we maintain a reserve for chargebacks and credits for estimated refunds related to customers whose transactions were processed via credit cards for both the subscription ppv tv and internet groups 
should our actual chargebacks and credits be higher than estimated we would have an additional expense for the period in which this was experienced 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination accounted for under the purchase method 
through the end of fiscal year  the company amortized its goodwill over years using the straight line method 
as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles fas  that was effective for the company as of the beginning of fiscal year  goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are no longer amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually 
the company completed the initial impairment test during the first quarter of fiscal year and concluded that the fair value of the company s reporting unit subscription ppv tv group exceeded its respective carrying value as of june  and  therefore  no impairment existed at that date 
in addition to the initial impairment test completed during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company elected to perform the first of its annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and concluded that the fair value of the company s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no impairment charge was required 
the company engaged a financial advisory firm to assist management in completing the impairment tests and to prepare certain analysis regarding the fair value of the company s reporting unit 
in developing its analysis  the financial advisory firm reviewed plans prepared by management  interviewed senior managers of the company and performed independent research 
calculations regarding the fair value of the company s reporting unit  including the analysis prepared by the financial advisory firm  rely primarily on forecasts and projections regarding future operating results and cash flows  which require management to make estimates and assumptions 
if actual operating results or cash flows are different than management s estimates and assumptions  the company could be required to record impairment charges in future periods 
in future years  the company will be required to complete the annual impairment test during its fourth fiscal quarter 
prepaid distribution rights the company s subscription ppv group s film and content library consists of newly produced and historical film licensing agreements 
the company accounts for the licenses in accordance with fas financial accounting by broadcasters 
accordingly  the company capitalizes the costs associated with the licenses and amortizes the costs on a straight line basis over the life of the licensing agreement usually to years 
pursuant to fas the costs associated with the license agreements should be amortized based on the relative revenues earned for each showing of the film 
management has determined that it is appropriate to amortize these costs on a straight line basis under the assertion that each showing of the film is expected to generate similar revenues 
the company regularly reviews and evaluates the appropriateness of amortizing film costs on a straight line basis and assesses if an accelerated method would more appropriately reflect the revenue generation of the content 
through its analysis  management has concluded that the current policy of recognizing the costs incurred to license the film library on a straight line basis most accurately reflects the revenue generated by each showing of the film 
management periodically reviews the film library and assesses if the unamortized cost approximates the fair market value of the films 
in the event that the unamortized costs exceed the fair market value of the film library  the company will expense the excess of the unamortized costs to reduce the carrying value of the film library to the fair market value 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended march    and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily related to an increase in the net loss of the company from million in to million in  an increase in accounts receivable from million to million  and a million increase in prepaid distribution rights related to the licensing of content 
the net loss of million for the year ended march  includes non cash charges of million for the valuation allowance established for the company s deferred tax assets  million in depreciation and amortization  and million with respect to asset impairments 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended march  was million 
this use of cash relates primarily to purchases of software licenses  minor equipment upgrades to the subscription ppv tv group s digital broadcast facility and the purchase of encrypting equipment for new cable launches 
the company anticipates capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended march  to be million million which will include improvements to its digital broadcast facility for upgrades to the facility s hvac  electrical and generator systems 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended march  this use of cash was related to million paid on the company s capital lease obligations 
this use of cash was offset by the issuance of million shares of class a redeemable preferred stock at per share 
the proceeds from this offering were used to repay million of the company s notes payable 
an additional million in debt was converted to million shares of class a redeemable preferred stock 
the class a redeemable preferred stock pays dividends at on a monthly and quarterly basis and is redeemable anytime at the company s option until january  by which time it must be redeemed 
in april  new frontier media  inc successfully negotiated a decrease in the dividend rate on million shares of its class a redeemable preferred stock from to for the remainder of the term 
in april and may  the company issued million shares of class b redeemable preferred stock at per share 
the proceeds from this offering were used to redeem million of the company s class a redeemable preferred stock and to fund the purchase and subsequent retirement of  shares of new frontier media  inc common stock as part of the bonn settlement 
the class b preferred stock pays dividends at on a quarterly basis and is redeemable at the company s option until october the class a and b preferred stock is subject to full or partial early redemption at the option of the holder if the company experiences a change in control defined as i a replacement of more than one half of the members of the company s board of directors which is not approved by a majority of those individuals who are members of the board of directors on the date of the issuance of the preferred or by those individuals who are serving as members of the board of directors on any date whose nomination to the board of directors was approved by a majority of the members of the board of directors who are members on the date of the issuance of the preferred  ii the merger of the company with or into another entity that is not wholly owned by the company  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the company in one or a series of related transactions  or iii the execution by the company of an agreement to which the company is a party or by which it is bound  providing for any of the events set forth in i or ii 
the company expects to fund the dividends due on the class a and b redeemable preferred stock from its cash flows from operations 
the company is also confident that it can fund the redemption of the class a and b redeemable preferred stock in through cash flows from operations or a refinancing of the obligation prior to the time of redemption 
in the event the preferred stock should become due by reason of a change in control  the company s liquidity and capital resources is likely to be materially and adversely impaired 
new frontier media believes that existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its operating requirements and believes that any capital expenditures that may be incurred can be financed through its cash flows from operations or lease financing 
if new frontier media were to lose its major customer that accounts for of its revenue  its ability to finance its operating requirements would be severely impaired

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk is principally confined to cash in the bank  money market accounts  and notes payable  which have short maturities and  therefore  minimal and immaterial market risk 
interest rate risk 
as of june   the company had cash in checking and money market accounts 
because of the short maturities of these instruments  a sudden change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these assets

the company does not have any foreign currency exposure because it currently does not transact business in foreign currencies
