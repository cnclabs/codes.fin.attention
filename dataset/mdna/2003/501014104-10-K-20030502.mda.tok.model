krispy kreme is a leading branded specialty retailer of premium quality doughnuts 
we have established krispy kreme as a leading consumer brand with a loyal customer base through our longstanding commitment to quality and consistency 
the combination of our well established brand  our one of a kind doughnuts  a unique retail experience featuring our stores fully displayed production process  our doughnut making theater  our vertical integration and our strong franchise system creates significant opportunities for continued growth 
our principal business  which began in  is owning and franchising krispy kreme doughnut stores where we make and sell over varieties of premium quality doughnuts  including our hot original glazed 
each of our stores is a doughnut factory with the capacity to produce from  dozen to over  dozen doughnuts daily 

table of contents consequently  each store has significant fixed or semi fixed costs  and margins and profitability are significantly impacted by doughnut production volume and sales 
our doughnut stores are versatile in that most can support multiple sales channels to more fully utilize production capacity 
these sales channels are comprised of on premises sales and off premises sales as described further under business model store operations 
we believe that krispy kreme has significant opportunities for continued growth 
our sales growth has been driven by new store openings  as well as systemwide comparable store sales growth of in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we believe our success is based on the strengths described below 
competitive strengths the universal appeal of our product 
our market research indicates that krispy kreme s breadth of appeal extends across major demographic groups  including age and income 
in addition to their taste  quality and simplicity  our doughnuts are an affordable indulgence 
this has contributed to many of our customers purchasing doughnuts by the dozen for their offices  clubs and families 
demand for our doughnuts occurs throughout the day  with approximately half of our on premises sales occurring in the morning and half in the afternoon and evening 
a proven concept 
krispy kreme is a focused yet versatile concept 
each of our distinctive krispy kreme stores is a doughnut making theater with the capacity  depending on equipment size  to produce from  dozen to over  dozen doughnuts daily 
our stores serve as our primary retail outlets 
they are also designed to create a multi sensory experience around our unique product and production process  which is important to our brand building efforts 
in addition to these on premises sales  we have developed multiple channels of sales outside our stores  which we refer to as off premises sales 
these sales channels improve the visibility of our brand  increase the convenience of purchase and capture sales from a wide variety of settings and occasions 
additionally  the ability to generate sales outside of our stores  utilizing the stores existing production capacity  minimizes the risk of an underperforming on premises sales location 
strong growth potential 
we believe the following represent significant growth opportunities for our company domestic store development 
we believe our factory stores stores which contain a full doughnut making production line as of february  represent less than one third of the total traditional factory stores we can ultimately build in north america 
our highest priority expansion plans in our recent store development efforts have focused on markets with over  households 
we will continue to expand in these markets because of their dense population characteristics which enable us to achieve economies of scale in local operations infrastructure and brand building efforts 
in fiscal  we announced an initiative to enhance our expansion through the opening of factory stores in small markets  those with less than  households 
through value engineering  we believe we have reduced the level of investment in property and equipment required to open a krispy kreme store  making the opportunity to enter small markets economically viable 
we also expect that stores in these small markets will participate in fund raising programs and develop off premises business  further enhancing the opportunity in these markets  although we believe that their retail sales alone will generate attractive financial returns 
we expect the stores opened in these markets will primarily be franchised stores and will be opened by our existing franchisees 
we are currently in the process of awarding concurrent development agreements for certain small markets to many of our existing franchisees 
international store development 
in fiscal  we began to expand our development efforts to include markets outside the continental united states 
through a joint venture  we began opening stores in canada 
in fiscal  we entered into a joint venture to develop the australian and new zealand markets and a joint venture to develop stores in the united kingdom and the republic of ireland 
we opened our first store in australia in fiscal  a commissary to be used for training and sampling prior to the opening of the first retail store  which is expected in fiscal we expect to open our first retail store in the united kingdom in fiscal as well 
based upon our initial research and experience with our first stores in canada  we are focusing our current international development efforts primarily on opportunities in australia and new zealand  the united kingdom  the republic of ireland  japan  mexico  south korea and spain 
we anticipate that development efforts in all of these markets will be through joint 
table of contents ventures 
our ability to expand in these or other international markets  however  will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our product  our ability to supply or obtain the ingredients and equipment necessary to produce our products and local laws or policies of the particular countries 
ultimately  we believe that the opportunity for growth through expansion internationally is at least as great as the domestic opportunity 
expanded beverage offerings 
one of our focus areas has been on creating a best in class beverage opportunity to complement our doughnut offering 
with the acquisition of digital java  inc  a small chicago based coffee company  in fiscal  we acquired significant coffee roasting expertise 
we relocated the acquired assets and operations to a newly constructed coffee roasting facility at our ivy avenue plant in winston salem  nc 
we have now formulated a complete beverage program  including four drip coffees  a complete line of espresso based coffees including flavors  and both coffee based and noncoffee based frozen drinks 
these drinks will complement our existing juices  sodas  milks and waters 
we introduced the first component of this program  the drip coffee offering  to our stores in fiscal  replacing the previous product which was purchased from an unrelated third party 
as of february   approximately krispy kreme locations offer the new  full beverage program  most of which are new stores that opened with the full program 
we anticipate introducing the remaining components of the new beverage program  primarily espresso and frozen beverages  in all remaining stores over the next twelve to eighteen months 
we believe this new beverage program represents an opportunity to increase beverage sales in a meaningful way  which in turn will enhance our profitability due to the attractive margins associated with beverage sales 
hot doughnut machine technology 
during fiscal  we developed a new hot doughnut machine technology which can provide our customers with virtually the same hot doughnut experience as the equipment in our factory stores 
this machine  however  has significant advantages over the factory store doughnut machine in that it is smaller in size  involves a less complicated production process and costs less 
we began our initial tests of the concept with doughnut and coffee shops in three different markets and venues in north carolina and continue to develop and enhance the technology 
as of february   five doughnut and coffee shops were open  four of which are owned by the company 
we plan to continue our tests of this concept 
we believe this technology will facilitate our expansion into smaller markets and into dense urban areas 
satellite store concept 
in addition to the doughnut and coffee shop concept  we plan to experiment with a new generation satellite concept  which will sell fresh doughnuts  beverages and krispy kreme collectibles 
the doughnuts will be supplied by a nearby factory store  multiple times each day 
we view the satellite concept  which we believe will have attractive financial returns  as an additional way to achieve market penetration in a variety of market sizes and settings 
we expect to begin our tests of this concept in the second half of fiscal montana mills bread co  inc in april  we completed the acquisition  through an exchange of stock  of montana mills bread co  inc montana mills  an owner and operator of upscale village bread stores in the northeastern and midwestern united states 
montana mills stores produce and sell a variety of breads and baked goods prepared in an open view format 
we believe krispy kreme s unique brand building and operational capabilities represent a significant leverage opportunity 
we will spend up to the next months refining and expanding the montana mills concept  retaining its core best in class breads  but expanding the offering to include bread based meals and appropriate accompaniments in an inviting  fast casual setting 
once developed  we plan to leverage our existing franchise network and the infrastructures our franchisees have created to roll out the concept 
we believe this network will substantially expedite a national expansion 
we also believe that this acquisition will provide an opportunity to leverage our existing capabilities  such as our distribution chain  off premises sales and coffee roasting expertise  to expand montana mills business 
the ingredients for market leadership 
the doughnut industry is highly fragmented and characterized by low volume outlets with undifferentiated product quality 
we believe that we have the ability to become the recognized leader in every market we enter through our unique combination of a strong brand a highly differentiated product a high volume production capacity 
table of contents a market penetration strategy using multiple sales channels a proven franchise system 
krispy kreme is committed to growth in part  through franchising 
our franchisees consist of associates who operate under our original franchising program developed in the s and area developers who operate under our franchising program developed in the mid s 
see store ownership 
we intend to continue to strengthen our franchise system by attracting and retaining experienced and well capitalized area developers who have the management capacity to develop multiple stores 
our development strategy permits us to grow in a controlled manner and enables us to ensure that each area developer strictly adheres to our high standards of quality and service 
we prefer that area developers have ownership and successful operating experience in multi unit food operations within the territory they propose for development 
to ensure a consistent high quality product  we require each franchisee to purchase our proprietary mixes and doughnut making equipment 
we devote significant resources to providing our franchisees with assistance in site selection  store design  employee training and marketing 
many of our franchisees are also our shareholders 
additionally  we intend to continue to acquire equity positions in selected franchisee businesses and also intend to continue to periodically repurchase associate or area developer markets to take advantage of opportunities for synergies and market expansion 
we believe that common ownership of equity will serve to further strengthen our relationships and align our mutual interests 
direct store delivery capabilities 
krispy kreme has developed a highly effective direct store delivery system  or dsd  for executing off premises sales 
we deliver fresh doughnuts  both packaged and unpackaged  to a variety of retail customers  such as supermarkets  convenience stores and other food service and institutional accounts 
through our company and franchised store operations  our route drivers are capable of taking customer orders and delivering products directly to our customers retail locations  where they are typically merchandised from krispy kreme branded displays 
we have also developed national account relationships and implemented electronic invoicing and payment systems with many large dsd customers 
we believe these strengths  coupled with our premium products  will provide us with significant sales opportunities by allowing us to assume the role of category manager for doughnut products in both the in store bakery and food service distribution channels 
a controlled process ensuring consistent high quality 
krispy kreme has a vertically integrated  highly automated system designed to create quality  consistency and efficiency 
our doughnut making process starts well before the store level operations with our owned and operated manufacturing plants  which produce our proprietary mixes our state of the art laboratories that test all key ingredients and each batch of mix produced our self manufactured  custom stainless steel doughnut making equipment additionally  at the store level  we provide a week manager training program covering the critical skills required to operate a krispy kreme store and a comprehensive training program for all positions in the store 
the manager training program includes classroom instruction  computer based modules and in store training 
the comprehensive training program for store personnel includes procedures for producing and finishing our doughnuts  as well as customer service 
a balanced financial model 
krispy kreme generates sales and income from three distinct sources company stores  which we refer to as company store operations  franchise fees and royalties from our franchise stores  which we refer to as franchise operations  and a vertically integrated supply chain  which we refer to as krispy kreme manufacturing and distribution  or kkm d 
in addition to lowering the cost of goods sold for our stores  kkm d generates attractive margins on sales of our mixes  equipment and coffee 
our franchising approach to growth minimizes our capital requirements and provides a highly attractive royalty stream 
we believe this financial model provides increased stability to our revenues and earnings and improves our return on investment 
our company store operations  franchise operations and kkm d comprise three reportable segments under generally accepted accounting principles 
you can review financial data for these segments in note business segment information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal business model 
table of contents krispy kreme is a vertically integrated company structured to support and profit from the high volume production and sale of high quality doughnut products 
high volume with high quality has always been the foundation of our business strategy 
our business is driven by two complementary business units our company and franchised stores  which we refer to collectively as store operations  and kkm d 
independently  each is designed to ensure quality and to benefit from economies of scale 
collectively  both function as an integrated  cost efficient system 
store operations 
the principal source of revenue for stores is the production and distribution of doughnuts 
as part of our unique business model  our stores are both retail outlets and highly automated  high volume producers of our doughnut products and can sell their products through our multiple sales channels 
on premises sales 
each of our stores offers at least of our more than varieties of doughnuts  including our signature hot original glazed and nine other prescribed varieties 
we also sell our drip coffee  other beverages  other bakery items and collectible memorabilia such as tee shirts  sweatshirts and hats 
fundraising sales  described under marketing  are another component of on premises sales 
in order to establish our brand identity with the total store experience and because of the higher margins associated with on premises sales  we typically focus our initial sales efforts in new markets on this channel 
off premises sales 
we accomplish off premises sales through our direct store delivery system which is designed to generate incremental sales increase market penetration and brand awareness increase customer convenience optimize utilization of our stores production capacity improve our stores return on investment as of february   approximately of our stores sold to major grocery store chains  including kroger  food lion  albertsons  speedway  giant food and acme markets  and to local and national convenience stores  as well as to select co branding customers 
kkm d 
the mission of kkm d is to create competitive advantages for our stores while operating as a profitable business enterprise 
we have developed important operating competencies and capabilities  which we use to support our stores  including strong product knowledge and technical skills control of all critical production and distribution processes collective buying power the basic raw materials used in our products are flour  sugar  shortening and packaging materials 
we obtain most of these materials under long term purchase agreements and in the commodity spot markets 
although we own the recipe to our glaze flavoring a key ingredient in many of our doughnuts we are currently dependent on a sole source for our supply 
however  we are in the process of establishing an alternative source 
we implement the mission of kkm d through three strategic business units mix manufacturing 
we produce all of our proprietary doughnut mixes at our manufacturing facilities in winston salem  nc and effingham  il 
we control production of this critical input in order to ensure that our products meet quality expectations and to maximize our profit potential 

table of contents manufacturing and selling our own mixes allows us to capture the profit that normally would accrue to an outside supplier and is more cost effective than purchasing from third party vendors 
our mixes are produced according to our high quality standards  which include requiring each carefully selected supplier to meet or exceed industry standards receiving truckloads of our main ingredients daily testing each incoming key ingredient testing each batch of mix equipment manufacturing 
we manufacture proprietary doughnut making equipment  which our franchisees are required to purchase 
our carefully engineered equipment  when combined with our proprietary mixes  produces doughnuts with uniform consistency and high quality 
manufacturing our equipment results in several advantages  including flexibility 
we manufacture several models  with varying capacities  which are capable of producing multiple products and fitting unusual store configurations 
cost effectiveness 
we believe our costs are lower than if we purchased our equipment from third parties 
efficiency 
we continually refine our equipment design to ensure maximum automation in order to manage labor costs and or improve consistency 
distribution centers 
we operate three distribution centers winston salem  nc  effingham  il  and greater los angeles  ca which are capable of supplying our stores with all of their key supplies  including all food ingredients  coffee  juices  signage  display cases  uniforms and various other items 
stores must use our doughnut mixes exclusively 
in addition  most of our store operators have agreed contractually through our supply chain alliance program to purchase all of their requirements for the critical areas of their business from kkm d through fiscal we believe that our ability to distribute supplies to our operators produces several advantages  including economies of scale 
we are able to purchase at volume discount prices  which we believe are lower than those that would be available to our operators individually 
in addition  we are selective in choosing our suppliers and require that they meet certain standards with regard to quality and reliability 
also  inventory is controlled on a systemwide basis rather than at the store level 
convenience 
our distribution centers offer our operators the convenience of one stop shopping 
we are able to supply our operators with all of the key items they need to operate their stores  which enables them to focus their energies on running their stores  rather than managing supplier relationships 
beverage program 
we provide many of the beverages offered in our stores  most of which are purchased from third parties 
however  one of our focus areas has been on creating a best in class beverage program 
through the acquisition in fiscal of digital java  inc  a small chicago based coffee company  we acquired significant coffee roasting expertise 
subsequent to the acquisition  we relocated the operations to a newly constructed coffee roasting facility at our ivy avenue plant in winston salem  nc  which became operational in fiscal we have now formulated a complete beverage program including four drip coffees  a complete line of espresso based coffees including flavors and both coffee based and noncoffee based frozen drinks 
we introduced the first component of this program  the drip coffee offering  to our stores in fiscal  replacing the previous product which was purchased from an unrelated third party 
as of february   the operation was supporting the new  full beverage program in approximately krispy kreme locations  most of which are new stores that opened with the full program 
we believe our new beverage program presents an opportunity to 
table of contents ensure a high quality product offering  increase beverage sales through an expanded product offering  and enhance profitability as a result of the higher margins associated with beverage sales 
krispy kreme brand elements krispy kreme is a blend of several important brand elements which has created a special bond with many of our customers 
the key elements are one of a kind taste 
the taste experience of our doughnuts is the foundation of our concept and the common thread that binds generations of our loyal customers 
our doughnuts are made from a secret recipe that has been in our company since we use only premium ingredients  which are blended by our custom equipment  to create this unique and very special product 
doughnut making theaters 
each of our stores showcases our doughnut making process 
our goal is to provide our customers with a unique entertainment experience and  in addition  visibly reinforce our commitment to quality and freshness 
hot doughnuts now 
the hot doughnuts now sign  when illuminated  is a signal that our hot original glazed are being made 
the hot doughnuts now sign is a strong impulse purchase generator and an integral contributor to our brand s mystique 
our hot original glazed are made for several hours every morning and evening  and at other special times during the day 
destination locations 
our full service stores incorporate doughnut making theaters  which are designed to produce a multi sensory customer experience and establish a strong brand identity 
our research indicates that many of our stores have the geographic drawing power comparable to a regional shopping mall and that our customers  on average  drive miles from their homes to our stores 
affordable indulgences 
our doughnuts are reasonably priced to ensure that they are affordable for the widest audience possible 
community relationships 
we are a national company  yet we are committed to strong local community relationships 
our store operators support their local communities through fundraising programs and the sponsorship of charitable events 
many of our loyal customers have warm memories of selling krispy kreme doughnuts to raise money for their schools  clubs and community organizations 
industry overview the doughnut industry is highly fragmented 
we expect doughnut sales to continue to grow due to a variety of factors  including the growth in two income households and corresponding shift towards foods consumed away from home  increased snack food consumption and further growth of doughnut purchases from in store bakeries 
we view the fragmented competition in the doughnut industry as an opportunity for our continued growth 
we also believe that the premium quality of our products and the strength of our brand will help enhance the growth and expansion of the overall doughnut market 
growth strategy krispy kreme is a proven concept with an established heritage 
the strength of our brand  our relatively small store population  and our attractive unit economics position us very well for growth in our domestic markets 
we plan to increase our revenues and profits by expanding our store base through small markets and satellite stores  improving on premises sales at existing stores and increasing off premises sales 
we have additional growth opportunities through our expansion in international markets  the introduction of our new beverage program and the hot doughnut machine 
the acquisition of montana mills presents further opportunities for growth 
we believe this acquisition gives us an opportunity to apply our experience and strength in creating a national franchise network toward building a franchise network for montana mills 
through these additional opportunities  our future growth prospects have expanded significantly 

table of contents expand our store base 
we view our stores as platforms from which we pursue on premises as well as off premises sales opportunities 
in fiscal  we anticipate opening approximately new stores under existing agreements  the majority of which are expected to be franchised stores located in the united states 
our franchisees  including the area developers in which we had a majority ownership interest as of february   freedom rings  llc freedom rings  the area developer with rights to develop stores in the philadelphia market  glazed investments  llc glazed investments  the area developer with rights to develop markets in colorado  minnesota and wisconsin  and golden gate doughnuts  llc golden gate  the area developer with rights to develop stores in northern california  are contractually obligated to open over new stores in both the united states and internationally in the fiscal through fiscal period 
the addition of new stores will be accomplished primarily through franchising with area developers following a prescribed development plan for their respective territories  although we also intend to open new company stores on a limited basis in existing or repurchased markets to take advantage of synergies and growth opportunities 
the development plan for most franchisees was created to optimally penetrate territories with over  households 
the plan assumes stores will be built in high density  prime retailing locations in order to maximize customer traffic and on premises sales volumes 
we believe a territory based development strategy creates substantial benefits to both krispy kreme and our area developers 
these benefits include real estate procurement and development scale to cost justify a strong local support infrastructure brand building and advertising ability to make marketwide commitments to chain store customers with respect to new store growth  we announced in fiscal an initiative to enhance our expansion through the opening of factory stores in small markets  those with less than  households 
we believe we have reduced the level of investment in property and equipment required to open a krispy kreme store  making the opportunity to enter small markets economically viable 
we will also continue to consider opportunities to acquire or increase an equity interest in franchisees or repurchase market rights from franchisees to take advantage of opportunities for synergies and market expansion 
during fiscal  we repurchased market rights  as well as the related assets  from franchisees in akron  ohio  destin  florida  pensacola  florida and toledo  ohio 
in march  we purchased the market rights  as well as related assets  from our franchisee with rights to certain markets in kansas and missouri 
improve existing stores on premises sales 
our area developers have demonstrated that a store employing our updated design located in a densely populated area is capable of generating and sustaining high volume on premises sales 
many of our stores built prior to were designed primarily as wholesale bakeries and their formats and site attributes differ considerably from newer stores 
in order to improve the on premises sales of some of these stores  we plan to remodel selected company stores and  in some limited instances  close or relocate certain stores to more dynamic locations within their territories 
finally  we consistently evaluate improvements or additions to our product line in order to increase same store sales levels and balance seasonality of sales 
increase off premises sales 
in new markets  we typically focus our initial efforts on on premises sales and then use the store platform to capitalize on off premises opportunities 
we intend to secure additional grocery and convenience store customers  as well as increase sales to our existing customer base  by offering premium quality products  category management and superior customer service 
in addition  we believe the food service and institutional channel of sales offers krispy kreme a significant opportunity to extend our brand into colleges and universities  business and industry complexes and sports and entertainment venues 
in new markets where capacity utilization remains high from servicing on premises sales  we may develop commissary production facilities to service off premises sales 
we believe that once high brand awareness has been established in a market  a commissary has the potential to improve market penetration and profitability 

table of contents international expansion 
as of february   we had entered into joint ventures to develop krispy kreme stores in canada  australia  new zealand  the united kingdom and the republic of ireland 
six stores were open in international markets as of february   five of which were located in canada 
the remaining store is in australia and is a commissary which will be used for training and sampling prior to the opening of the first retail store in that market  expected in fiscal under the terms of their development agreements  these joint ventures are committed to open an additional stores in the period from fiscal through fiscal we anticipate entering into additional joint ventures to develop markets outside the united states as our initial research and experience indicates that other markets present viable opportunities for the krispy kreme concept 
other markets we are focusing on include japan  mexico  south korea and spain 
expanded beverage offerings 
in addition to our juices  sodas  milk and waters  we have formulated a beverage program which includes four drip coffees  a complete line of espresso based coffees including flavors and both coffee based and noncoffee based frozen drinks 
we introduced the first component of this program  the drip coffee offering  to our stores in fiscal the drip coffee  roasted in our facility  replaced the existing product which was purchased from a third party 
approximately krispy kreme locations currently offer the full  new beverage program 
we plan to introduce the remaining components of the program  espresso based coffees and frozen drinks  in our remaining stores over the next twelve to eighteen months 
we believe that our expanded beverage offering will increase beverage sales as well as enhance our profitability  due to the higher margins generally associated with beverage sales 
doughnut and coffee shops 
during fiscal  we introduced a new concept store  the doughnut and coffee shop 
this store uses the new hot doughnut machine technology  which completes the final steps of the production process and requires less space than the full production equipment in our traditional factory store 
this technology combines time  temperature and humidity elements to re heat unglazed doughnuts  provided by a traditional factory store  and prepare them for the glazing process 
once glazed  customers can have virtually the same hot doughnut experience in a doughnut and coffee shop as in a factory store 
additionally  the doughnut and coffee shop offers our new full line of coffee and other beverages 
as of february   five doughnut and coffee shops were open  four of which are owned by the company 
we plan to continue our tests of this concept 
satellite store concept 
in addition to the doughnut and coffee shop concept  we plan to experiment with a new generation satellite concept 
in this concept  we will sell fresh doughnuts  beverages and krispy kreme collectibles  however  the doughnuts will not be produced on site  but rather will be supplied by a nearby factory store  multiple times each day 
we view the satellite concept  which we believe will have attractive financial returns  as an additional way to achieve market penetration in a variety of market sizes and settings 
we expect to begin our tests of this concept in the second half of fiscal montana mills bread co  inc in april  we completed the acquisition  through an exchange of stock  of montana mills bread co  inc  an owner and operator of upscale village bread stores in the northeastern and midwestern united states 
montana mills stores produce and sell a variety of breads and baked goods prepared in an open view format 
we believe krispy kreme s unique brand building and operational capabilities represent a significant leverage opportunity 
we will spend up to the next months refining and expanding the montana mills concept  retaining its core best in class breads  but expanding the offering to include bread based meals and appropriate accompaniments in an inviting  fast casual setting 
once developed  we plan to leverage our existing franchise network and the infrastructures our franchisees have created to roll out the concept 
we believe this network will substantially expedite a national expansion 
we also believe that this acquisition will provide an opportunity to leverage our existing capabilities  such as our distribution chain  off premises sales and coffee roasting expertise  to expand montana mills business 
unit economics we believe that krispy kreme unit economics represent an attractive investment opportunity for our area developers and as such are a significant factor contributing to the growth and success of the krispy kreme concept 
we estimate that the investment for a typical new store  excluding land and pre opening costs  is approximately  for a building of approximately  square feet and approximately  to  for equipment  furniture and fixtures 
the following table provides certain financial information relating to company and franchised stores 
average weekly sales per store are calculated by dividing store revenues by the actual number of sales weeks included in 
table of contents each period 
company stores operating cash flow is store revenues less all direct store expenses other than depreciation expenses 
year ended january  february  february  dollars in thousands average weekly sales per store company franchised company stores operating cash flow as a percentage of store revenues average weekly sales for company stores are higher than for franchised stores due to lower average weekly sales volumes of older associate stores that are included in the franchised stores calculations  as well as the impact in company stores sales of the sales of our consolidated joint ventures stores  most of which are new stores opened in the last three fiscal years 
franchised stores average weekly sales have been increasing  however  as higher volume area developer stores become a larger proportion of the franchised store base 
additionally  new area developer stores sales are principally on premises sales  which have higher operating margins than off premises sales 
company stores  excluding the consolidated joint ventures stores  and associate stores generate a significant percentage of revenues from lower margin off premises sales 
store development and operations site selection 
our objective is to create highly visible destination locations 
our comprehensive site selection process focuses on high volume traffic high household density proximity to both daytime employment and residential centers proximity to other retail traffic generators we work closely with our franchisees to assist them in selecting sites 
a site selection team visits each site and the surrounding area before approving a store location 
we believe that this process ensures that each new store will comply with our standards 
store operations 
our new stores are approximately  square feet 
they are equipped with automated doughnut making equipment capable of producing from  dozen to  dozen doughnuts daily 
this capacity can support sales in excess of  per week 
we outline uniform specifications and designs for each krispy kreme store and require compliance with our standards regarding the operation of the store  including  but not limited to varieties of products product specifications sales channels packaging sanitation and cleaning signage furniture and fixtures image and use of logos and trademarks training marketing and advertising 
table of contents we also require the use of a computer and cash register system with specified capabilities to ensure the collection of sales information necessary for effective store management 
all of our franchisees provide us with weekly sales reports and periodic financial statements 
we routinely assist our franchisees with issues such as operating procedures advertising and marketing programs administrative  bookkeeping and accounting procedures public relations generation of sales and operating data we also provide an opening team  which consists of up to nine people  to provide on site training and assistance during the first two weeks of operation for each initial store opened by a new franchisee 
the number of opening team members providing this assistance is reduced with each subsequent store opening for an existing franchisee 
our stores which engage in off premises sales typically operate on a hour schedule 
other stores generally operate from am to am  seven days a week  excluding some major holidays 
traditionally  our sales have been slower during the christmas holiday season and the summer months 
quality standards and customer service 
we encourage all of our employees to be courteous  helpful  knowledgeable and attentive 
we emphasize the importance of performance by linking a portion of both a company store manager s and an assistant store manager s incentive compensation to profitability and customer service 
we also encourage high levels of customer service and the maintenance of our high quality standards by frequently monitoring our stores through a variety of methods  including periodic quality audits and mystery shoppers 
in addition  our customer experience department handles customer comments and conducts routine satisfaction surveys of our off premises customers 
management and staffing 
it is important that our corporate staff and store managers work as a team 
our chief operating officer  along with other corporate officers responsible for store operations  are responsible for corporate interaction with our store operations division directors and store management 
through our divisional directors  each of whom is responsible for a specific geographic region  we communicate frequently with all store managers and their staff using store audits  weekly communications by telephone or e mail and both scheduled and surprise store visits 
we offer a comprehensive week training program  conducted both at our headquarters and at certified training stores  which provides store managers the critical skills required to operate a krispy kreme store 
the program includes classroom instruction  computer based training modules and in store training 
our staffing varies depending on a store s size  volume of business  and number of sales channels 
stores with sales through all sales channels have approximately employees handling on premises sales  processing  production  bookkeeping and sanitation and between delivery personnel 
area developers frequently hire employees from leasing agencies and employ staff based on store volume and size 
hourly employees  along with delivery personnel  are trained by local store management through hands on experience and training manuals 
we believe that our success is a natural result of the growth and development of our people 
we are developing a career model for both management and non exempt employees  which will focus on personal development and career growth 
the program will link an individual s economic  career and personal goals with our corporate and store level goals 
store ownership we divide our stores into three categories of ownership company stores  associate stores and area developer stores 
we refer to associates and area developers as franchisees  collectively 
store counts include retail stores and commissaries and exclude the doughnut and coffee shops and the current version of our satellite concept stores 

table of contents company stores 
as of february   krispy kreme owned stores  including which are operated by consolidated joint ventures 
a majority of these stores were developed between and and were designed as wholesale bakeries generate a majority of their sales volume through off premises sales are located in the southeast are larger than new krispy kreme stores of the company stores owned by area developers in which we have a controlling interest  four are owned by freedom rings  in which we own a interest  twelve are owned by glazed investments  in which we have an approximate interest and thirteen are owned by golden gate  in which we own a interest 
the terms of our arrangements with area developers as described below are applicable to our agreements with these joint ventures as well 
associates 
we had associates who operated stores as of february  associate stores have attributes which are similar to those of company stores 
this group generally concentrates on growing sales within the current base of stores rather than developing new stores or new territories 
with two exceptions  associates are not obligated to develop additional stores within their territories 
we cannot grant licenses to other franchisees or sell products bearing the krispy kreme brand name within an associate s territory during the term of the license agreement 
associates are typically parties to year licensing agreements  which generally permit them to operate stores using the krispy kreme system within a specific territory 
associates pay royalties of of on premises sales and of all other sales  with the exception of private label sales for which they pay no royalties 
although they are not required to contribute to the public relations and advertising fund  in fiscal most of the associates voluntarily contributed of all sales to the public relations and advertising fund 
our associates who were shareholders prior to our initial public offering in april have franchise agreements which were extended automatically for a period of years following that offering and thereafter are renewed automatically for five year periods  unless previously terminated by either party 
we do not plan to license any new krispy kreme franchisees under the terms of the associate license agreement 
area developers 
under our area developer franchise program  which we introduced in the mid s to strategically expand nationally into new territories  we license territories  usually defined by metropolitan statistical areas  to area developers who are capable of developing a prescribed number of stores within a specified time period 
area developer stores typically are designed and developed in locations favorable to achieving high volume on premises sales  although they are also equipped to generate off premises sales 
as of february   we had area developers operating stores 
these area developers have contractual commitments to open over stores in their territories during their initial development schedule 
of these area developers  we had a controlling interest in three and a minority equity interest in twelve 
those in which we have a controlling interest operated stores as of february  and those in which we have a minority interest operated stores as of february  we believe equity investments in our area developer territories more closely align our interests with our area developers and also create greater financial opportunity for the company 
effective march   the company acquired the rights to certain franchise markets in kansas and missouri  as well as the related assets  which included five stores  from an area developer franchisee  in exchange for cash of approximately  the operations and assets acquired  primarily inventory and equipment  will be included with those of the company effective march  our area developers are typically multi unit food operators with a high level of knowledge about the local territory or territories they will develop and a proven financial capability to fully develop their territories 
our strategy  in part  is to grow through area developers 
our area developer program includes a royalty and fee structure that is more attractive to krispy kreme than that of our associate program  as well as territory development requirements 

table of contents each of our area developers is required to enter into two types of agreements a development agreement which establishes the number of stores to be developed in an area and a franchise agreement for each store opened 
area developers typically pay franchise fees ranging from  to  for each store they develop 
our current standard franchise agreement provides for a year term 
the agreement is renewable subject to our discretion and can be terminated for a number of reasons  including the failure of the franchisee to make timely payments within applicable grace periods  subject to state law 
area developers pay a royalty fee on all sales and are required to contribute of all sales to a company administered public relations and advertising fund 
in addition to a franchise agreement  all area developers have signed development agreements which require them to develop a specified number of stores on or before specific dates 
generally  these agreements have a five year term 
if area developers fail to develop their stores on schedule  we have the right to terminate the agreement and develop company stores or develop stores through new area developers or joint ventures 
generally  we do not provide financing to our franchisees other than in our capacity as an equity investor as described above 
when we are an equity investor  we contribute equity or guarantee debt or lease commitments of the joint venture generally proportionate to our ownership interest 
see note joint ventures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in the past  however  we maintained a program permitting franchisees to lease proprietary krispy kreme equipment from our primary bank and we guaranteed the leases 
one franchisee took advantage of this program  which we no longer offer 
marketing krispy kreme s approach to marketing is a natural extension of our brand equity  brand attributes  relationship with our customers and our values 
we believe we have a responsibility to our customers to engage in marketing activities that are consistent with  and further reinforce  their confidence and strong feelings about krispy kreme 
accordingly  we have established certain guiding brand principles  which include we will not attempt to define the krispy kreme experience for our customer  we prefer to have our customers tell their krispy kreme stories and share their experiences with others  we will focus on enhancing customer experiences through product focused  value added activities  and we will develop local  community based relationships in all krispy kreme markets 
to build our brand and drive our comparable store sales in a manner aligned with our brand principles  we have focused our marketing activities in the following areas store experience 
our stores are where customers first experience a hot original glazed 
customers know that when our hot doughnuts now sign in the store window is illuminated  they can see our doughnuts being made and enjoy a hot original glazed within seconds after it passes through the glaze waterfall 
we believe this begins a lifetime relationship with our customers and forms the foundation of the krispy kreme experience 
relationship marketing 
most of our brand building activities are grassroots based and focus on developing relationships with various constituencies  including consumers  schools  communities and businesses 
specific initiatives include product donations to local radio and television stations  schools  government agencies and other community organizations good neighbor product deliveries to create trial uses sponsorship of local events and nonprofit organizations 
table of contents a good grades program  which recognizes scholastic achievement with certificates and free doughnuts our krispy kreme ambassador program  which enlists our fans as ambassadors in new markets to generate awareness and excitement around a new store opening friends of krispy kreme enewsletter sent to those customers that have registered to receive monthly updates about new products  promotions and store openings 
fundraising sales 
fundraising sales are high volume sales to local charitable organizations at discounted prices 
charities in turn resell our products at prices which approximate retail 
we believe that providing a fundraising program to local community organizations and schools helps demonstrate our commitment to the local community  enhances brand awareness  increases consumer loyalty and attracts more customers into our stores 
product placement 
since fiscal  as we began growing nationally  there has been a significant increase in our product placements and references to our products on television programs and in selected films  including nbc s today show  rosie o donnell  the tonight show with jay leno  ally mcbeal  nypd blue  the practice and primary colors  among others 
we have been mentioned in more than movies and television shows during the year ended february  and more than movies and television shows during the prior three years 
we have also been featured or mentioned in over  print publications during fiscal and  print publications during fiscal  including the wall street journal  the new york times  the washington post  the los angeles times  newsweek  glamour  instyle and people 
we believe the increasing number of placements and references are a reflection of the growing interest in our product and brand 
advertising 
relationship marketing and product placement have been central to building our brand awareness 
although our marketing strategy has not historically employed traditional advertising  we will occasionally utilize live radio and direct mail to generate awareness and trial usage of our products 
management information systems krispy kreme has a management information system that allows for the rapid communication of extensive information among our corporate office  support operations  company stores  associates and area developers 
our franchisees and other affiliates connect to this system through our intranet and have access to e mail and the ability to provide financial reporting 
our management information systems strategy centers around our corporate portal  mykrispykreme 
com  which leverages intranet  extranet and internet environments 
we have adopted a balanced scorecard approach for measuring key performance drivers in each of our business units 
scorecard data are generated internally through our management information system 
an enterprise resource planning system supports all major financial and operating functions within the corporation  including financial reporting  inventory control and human resources 
a comprehensive data warehouse system supports the financial and operating needs of our store operations and kkm d 
all company stores have been retrofitted with a windows nt based point of sale  or pos  system 
this pos system provides each store with the ability to more closely manage on premises and off premises sales while providing a kiosk into our intranet 
we poll the sales information from each store s pos system  which gives us the ability to analyze data regularly 
daily two way electronic communication with our stores permits sales transactions to be uploaded and price changes to be downloaded to in store pos servers 
direct store delivery sales operations have access to an internally developed route accounting system networked into the corporate intranet 
information from these systems is polled at multiple times weekly and aggregated into the corporate manufacturing data warehouse 
the majority of our information technology hardware  including pos systems  is leased 

table of contents competition our competitors include retailers of doughnuts and snacks sold through supermarkets  convenience stores  restaurants and retail stores 
we compete against dunkin donuts  which has the largest number of outlets in the doughnut retail industry  as well as against regionally and locally owned doughnut shops 
we also compete against other retailers who sell sweet treats such as cookie stores and ice cream stores 
we compete on elements such as food quality  concept  convenience  location  customer service and value 
customer service  including frequency of deliveries and maintenance of fully stocked shelves  is an important factor in successfully competing for shelf space in grocery stores and convenience stores 
we believe that our controlled process  which ensures the high volume production of premium quality doughnuts  makes us strong competitors in both food quality and value 
through our comprehensive site selection process and uniform store specifications and designs  we identify premier locations that are highly visible and increase customer convenience 
we believe that in the in store bakery market  many operators are looking for cost effective alternatives to making doughnuts on site 
with a quality product and recognized brand name  krispy kreme has been able to provide a turnkey program that is profitable for the grocer 
in addition  we also believe that we compete effectively in convenience stores 
there is an industry trend moving towards expanded fresh product offerings during morning and evening drive times  and products are either sourced from a central commissary or brought in by local bakeries 
krispy kreme provides fresh daily delivery  merchandised in an attractive branded display which retailers must use to participate in the program 
through effective signage and merchandising  operators are able to draw customers into the store  thus gaining add on sales 
as category management increases in this segment  growth should come from increased market penetration and enhanced display opportunities for our products 
in the packaged doughnut market  we offer a full product line of doughnuts and snacks that are sold on a consignment basis and are typically merchandised on a free standing branded display 
we compete primarily with other well known producers of baked goods  such as hostess and dolly madison  and some regional brands 
trademarks our doughnut shops are operated under the krispy kreme name  and we use over federally registered trademarks and service marks  including krispy kreme and hot doughnuts now and the logos associated with these marks 
we have also registered some of our trademarks in approximately other countries 
we license the use of these trademarks to our franchisees for the operation of their doughnut shops 
we also license the use of certain trademarks to convenience stores and grocery stores in connection with the sale of some of our products at those locations 
although we are not aware of anyone else who is using krispy kreme or hot doughnuts now as a trademark or service mark  we are aware that some businesses are using krispy or a phonetic equivalent  such as crispie creme  as part of a trademark or service mark associated with retail doughnut stores 
there may be similar uses we are unaware of which could arise from prior users 
we aggressively pursue persons who unlawfully and without our consent use our trademarks 
government regulation local regulation 
our stores  both those in the united states and those in international markets  are subject to licensing and regulation by a number of government authorities  which may include health  sanitation  safety  fire  building and other agencies in the states or municipalities in which our doughnut shops are located 
developing new doughnut stores in particular areas could be delayed by problems in obtaining the required licenses and approvals or by more stringent requirements of local government bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors 
our standard development and franchise agreements require our area developers and associates to comply with all applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations  and indemnify us for costs we may incur attributable to their failure to comply 

table of contents food product regulation 
our doughnut mixes are produced at our manufacturing facilities in winston salem  nc and effingham  il 
the north carolina department of agriculture has regulatory power over food products shipped from our winston salem  facility 
additionally  shipments from our effingham facility are subject to the applicable governmental rules and regulations 
similar state regulations may apply to products shipped from our doughnut shops to grocery or convenience stores 
many of our grocery and convenience store customers require us to guarantee our products compliance with applicable food regulations 
as is the case for other food producers  numerous other government regulations apply to our products 
for example  the ingredient list  product weight and other aspects of our product labels are subject to state and federal regulation for accuracy and content 
most states will periodically check the product for compliance 
the use of various product ingredients and packaging materials is regulated by the us department of agriculture and the federal food and drug administration 
conceivably  one or more ingredients in our products could be banned  and substitute ingredients would then need to be found 
as we expand internationally  we will be exporting our products  principally our doughnut mixes and coffee  to our franchisees in markets outside the united states 
numerous government regulations apply to both the export of food products from the united states as well as the import of food products into other countries 
if one or more of the ingredients in our products are banned  alternative ingredients would need to be found 
although we intend to be proactive in addressing any product ingredient issues  such requirements may delay our ability to open stores in other countries in accordance with our desired schedule 
franchise regulation 
we must comply with regulations adopted by the federal trade commission  or the ftc  and with several state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises 
the ftc s trade regulation rule on franchising ftc rule and certain state laws require that we furnish prospective franchisees with a franchise offering circular containing information prescribed by the ftc rule and applicable state laws and regulations 
we also must comply with a number of state laws that regulate some substantive aspects of the franchisor franchisee relationship 
these laws may limit a franchisor s ability to terminate or not renew a franchise without good cause  interfere with the right of free association among franchisees  disapprove the transfer of a franchise  discriminate among franchisees with regard to charges  royalties and other fees  and place new stores near existing franchises 
to date  these laws have not precluded us from seeking franchisees in any given area and have not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
bills intended to regulate certain aspects of franchise relationships have been introduced into congress on several occasions during the last decade  but none has been enacted 
employment regulations 
we are subject to state and federal labor laws that govern our relationship with employees  such as minimum wage requirements  overtime and working conditions and citizenship requirements 
many of our on premises and delivery personnel are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage 
accordingly  further increases in the minimum wage could increase our labor costs 
furthermore  the work conditions at our facilities are regulated by the occupational safety and health administration and are subject to periodic inspections by this agency 
other regulations 
we have several contracts to serve united states military bases  which require compliance with certain applicable regulations 
the stores which serve these military bases are subject to health and cleanliness inspections by military authorities 
these accounts are not material to our overall business 
we are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations  but we currently believe that these will not have a material effect on our operations 
employees as of february  we employed  people 
of these  were employed in our administrative offices and were employed in our manufacturing and distribution centers 
in our company stores and commissaries  we had  employees 
of these   were full time  including managers and administrators 
these numbers do not include persons employed by our freedom rings  glazed investments or golden gate joint ventures

we believe our relationships with our employees are good

we occupy approximately  square feet of this multi tenant facility under a lease that expires on january   with one five year renewal option

on march   a lawsuit was filed against the company  management  and golden gate  one of the company s consolidated joint ventures  in superior court in the state of california 
the plaintiffs alleged  among other things  breach of contract  and sought compensation for damages and punitive damages 
in september  after the case was transferred to sacramento superior court  that court granted the motion to compel arbitration of the action and stay the lawsuit pending the outcome of arbitration 
after an appeal to the california appellate courts  on october   plaintiffs filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association against kkdc  golden gate and others 
after an extended series of arbitration hearings  the arbitration panel dismissed all claims against all parties  except the claim for breach of contract against kkdc and golden gate 
the panel entered a preliminary award of  against kkdc and golden gate  which was substantially less than the damages claimed 
the company recorded a provision of  in fiscal  consisting of the  award plus an estimate of the plaintiff s legal fees and other costs expected to be awarded of  although further hearings have been scheduled to determine issues concerning litigation fees and costs  the company anticipates that all claims will be concluded in early fiscal in a manner acceptable to the company without further substantial adverse consequences 
from time to time  we are subject to other claims and suits arising in the course of our business  none of which we believe is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we maintain customary insurance policies against claims and suits which arise in the course of our business  including insurance policies for workers compensation and personal injury  some of which provide for relatively large deductible amounts
