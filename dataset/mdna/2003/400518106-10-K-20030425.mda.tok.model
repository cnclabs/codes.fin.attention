general we operate on a to week fiscal year ending on the last saturday in february and fiscal ended on february  fiscal is a week year and we will include the extra week in our fourth quarter ending february we have derived substantially all of our revenues from the rendering of services and the sale or supply of computerized online lottery systems and components to government authorized lotteries 
our service revenues are derived primarily from lottery service contracts  which are typically at least five years in duration  and generally provide compensation to us based upon a percentage of a lottery s gross online lottery sales 
these percentages vary depending on the size of the lottery and the scope of services provided to the lottery 
we derive product sale revenues primarily from the installation of new online lottery systems  installation of new software and sales of lottery terminals and equipment in connection with the expansion of existing lottery systems 
our product margins fluctuate depending on the mix  volume and timing of product sale contracts 
the size and timing of these transactions have resulted in variability in product sale revenues from period to period 
excluding the proposed acquisitions of polcard sa and interlott technologies  inc described below  we currently anticipate that product sales during fiscal will be in the range of million to million 
we continue to evaluate a variety of opportunities to broaden our offerings of high volume transaction processing services outside of our core market of providing online lottery services  such as the processing and transmitting of commercial  non lottery transactions including bill payments  electronic tax payments  utility payments and retail based programs such as gift cards 
currently  our networks in brazil and chile process bill payments and other commercial service transactions 
in the near term  we expect to concentrate our efforts to grow commercial service revenues in brazil  poland and mexico 
while our goal is to leverage our technology  infrastructure and relationships to drive growth in commercial services  if  in the course of pursuing these opportunities  we see a chance to gain access to certain markets through the acquisition of existing infrastructure  we may consider making such acquisitions 
our business is highly regulated  and the competition to secure new government contracts is often intense 
from time to time  competitors challenge our contract awards and there have been  and may continue to be  investigations of various types  including grand jury investigations conducted by governmental authorities into possible improprieties and wrongdoing in connection with efforts to obtain and or the awarding of lottery contracts and related matters 
in light of the fact that such investigations frequently are conducted in secret  we may not necessarily know of the existence of an investigation which might involve us 
because our reputation for integrity is an important factor in our business dealings with lottery and other governmental agencies  a governmental allegation or a finding of improper conduct on our part or attributable to us in any manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  including our ability to retain existing contracts or to obtain new or renewal contracts 
in addition  continuing adverse publicity resulting from these investigations and related matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 
see part i  item  certain factors that may affect future performance for further information 
we are a global business and we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from operations outside of the united states 
in particular  in fiscal  we derived of our revenues from international operations and of our revenues from our brazilian operations alone including of our revenues from caixa economica federal  the operator of brazil s national lottery  which was our largest customer in fiscal based on annual revenues 
in addition  substantial portions of our assets  primarily consisting of equipment we use to operate online lottery systems for our customers  are held outside of the united states 
we are also exposed to more general risks of international operations  including increased governmental regulation of the online lottery industry in the markets where we operate  exchange controls or other currency restrictions  and significant political instability 
subsequent events in february after the close of fiscal  we entered into an agreement to purchase a controlling equity position in polcard sa polcard  a debit and credit card merchant transaction acquirer and processor in poland 
this agreement provides for the purchase of approximately of the outstanding share capital of polcard from its present shareholders  a group of polish banks and a travel services company  orbis sa the acquisition of polcard will be effected through a polish company created for purposes of the acquisition 
after completion of the acquisition  we will own of polcard s outstanding equity  two funds managed by innova capital sp 
zo 
o innova  a warsaw based private equity investment advisor  will own of polcard s outstanding equity  and the polish bank association  one of polcard s current owners  will continue to own of the outstanding equity of polcard 
the aggregate purchase price to be paid by us and innova for the polcard equity to be acquired  together with approximately million in debt assumed as part of the transaction  is expected to be approximately million 
consummation of the polcard acquisition is contingent upon the approval of the polish competition and consumer protection office and the polish bank association  and is subject to certain other closing conditions 
we have the option to purchase innova s interest in polcard  and innova has the reciprocal right to sell its interest in polcard to us  during the period commencing approximately four and ending approximately six years after closing 
we expect the closing of the polcard acquisition to occur in june in march after the close of fiscal  we entered into an agreement to acquire interlott technologies  inc interlott  a provider of instant ticket vending machines for the worldwide lottery industry 
this agreement provides for us to pay per share of interlott in cash or holdings common stock  and to assume debt of approximately million  for a total purchase price of approximately million 
our obligation to complete this acquisition is subject to obtaining approval of the transaction by interlott shareholders  securing necessary regulatory consents  and satisfying certain other closing conditions 
approval of this transaction by our shareholders is not required 
we expect the closing of the interlott acquisition to occur by late july in april after the close of fiscal  we entered into an agreement with caixa economica federal cef  the operator of brazil s national lottery and our largest customer in fiscal  pursuant to which the term of our contract with cef  which had been scheduled to expire in april  is extended for months from april with cef having the right to elect upon prior notice to terminate the contract early at any time after months  and fees payable under our contract are reduced by 
see part ii  item legal proceedings 
in april  we entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with the state of rhode island the state  the rhode island economic development corporation the edc and the city of providence  rhode island the city 
pursuant to the mou  we agreed to develop and construct a new  square foot world corporate headquarters facility in the city and a new manufacturing facility in the town of west warwick  rhode island 
the state agreed  pursuant to the mou  to support the passage of legislation authorizing the rhode island lottery commission to enter into a contract with us under which we would purchase the right to become the exclusive provider of online  instant ticket and video lottery systems and services for the rhode island lottery the lottery during the year term of the contract for an up front payment by us in the amount of million the master contract 
the mou further provides that  through december   we are to invest at least million in the state  in the aggregate  in connection with the development and construction of our new world corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities  and performing our obligations under the master contract 
the mou calls for the edc and the city to facilitate our obtaining certain tax incentives from state and local authorities in connection with the relocation of our world corporate headquarters 
we plan to discharge our obligations under the mou respecting the relocation of our world corporate headquarters by having a new  square foot office building built in the capital center district of the city and relocating our world corporate headquarters to that facility for the term of the master contract 
we are presently evaluating whether we will own or lease that facility 
as contemplated by the mou  we expect to replace the video lottery terminals we have previously installed with new terminals and to provide the lottery with an additional  new video lottery terminals 
in april  we also announced that we intended to enter into a purchase and sale agreement with a subsidiary of amgen inc amgen  a global biotechnology company  for the sale of our world headquarters facilities and surrounding property in west greenwich  rhode island 
our world headquarters facilities are owned  and leased to us  by west greenwich technology associates  lp the partnership  a limited partnership in which we have a limited partnership interest  and any definitive purchase and sale agreement would require the approval of  and participation as a party by  the partnership 
we subsequently announced that these negotiations with amgen ended without agreement 
as of april   we are in negotiations with the state  the edc and the city regarding a possible amendment to the mou to reflect changes resulting from the termination of the amgen negotiations 
on the basis of such negotiations to date  we do not presently believe that the termination of our negotiations with amgen will affect the planned relocation of our world corporate headquarters to the city  or materially impact the implementation of the other arrangements described above with respect to the mou  except that we now plan to upgrade and otherwise modify our existing manufacturing facility in the town of west greenwich  rhode island to support our expected expansion and consolidation of manufacturing operations  rather than construct a new manufacturing facility in the town of west warwick  rhode island 
however  because such negotiations are ongoing and the arrangements described in the mou are  in any event  subject to the passage of legislation by the state  the negotiation and execution of definitive arrangements including the master contract  and certain other contingencies  there can be no assurance that the transactions described above will be consummated  or if they are consummated  that they will not be on terms that differ materially from the terms set forth above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
significant contract rebids and extensions a majority of our revenues and cash flow is derived from our portfolio of long term online lottery service contracts  each of which in the ordinary course of our business is periodically the subject of competitive procurement or renegotiation 
in april after the close of fiscal  we entered into an agreement with caixa economica federal cef  the operator of brazil s national lottery  pursuant to which the term of our contract with cef  which had been scheduled to expire in april  is extended for months from april with cef having the right to elect upon prior notice to terminate the contract early at any time after months  and fees payable under our contract are reduced by 
see part ii  item legal proceedings 
our current contract with cef  which as extended  expires in april  was our largest contract in fiscal  as measured by annual revenues  accounting for of our consolidated revenues 
the california lottery contract  which was our third largest contract in fiscal based on annual revenues  expires in october on october   following a competitive bidding process  we entered into a facilities management agreement to provide online lottery technology  equipment and services to the california lottery for a period of six years beginning on october   with four additional one year options to extend the agreement at the discretion of the california lottery 
after the exercise of any extension options  the agreement will remain in effect until either party gives notice of termination at least two years in advance 
the georgia lottery contract  which was our fourth largest contract in fiscal based on annual revenues  expires in september on november   following a competitive bidding process  we were awarded a contract by the georgia lottery corporation to provide equipment for an online gaming system and related services  including a new wireless telecommunications network  for a seven year period which is expected to commence on september  see part i  item certain factors that may affect future performance our lottery operations are dependent upon our continued ability to retain and extend our existing contracts and win new contracts and significant developments since the start of fiscal lottery contract awards for further information concerning these matters 
critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies listed below that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize service revenues as the services are performed 
revenues from product sales or sales type leases are recognized when installation is complete and the customer accepts the product when acceptance is a stipulated contractual term 
when we are not responsible for installation  revenue is recognized when the product is shipped 
amounts invoiced or received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are recorded in advance payments from customers in our consolidated balance sheets 
we record liquidated damages which equaled  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively as a reduction of revenue in the period they become probable and estimable 
generally  we record product sales under long term contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  product sales and estimated gross profits are recognized as work is completed and accepted by the customer and are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs in the period when the information necessary to make the adjustment becomes available 
provision for contract losses are made when the loss becomes known and quantifiable 
we use the completed contract method of accounting for long term contracts whenever we are unable to estimate the costs to complete the delivery or when the contract stipulates that the entire balance due under the contract is refundable if the customer does not accept the product 
under the completed contract method of accounting  we record product sales when we have substantially completed our obligations under the contract 
a contract is regarded as substantially completed if remaining costs and potential risks are insignificant in amount 
receivables and inventory reserves we evaluate the collectibility of trade accounts and sales type lease receivables on a customer by customer basis and we believe our reserves are adequate  however  if economic circumstances change significantly resulting in a major customer s inability or unwillingness to meet its financial obligations to us  original estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by significant amounts requiring additional reserves 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
inventories include amounts we manufacture or assemble for our long term service contracts  which are transferred to systems  equipment and other assets relating to contracts upon shipment 
inventories also include amounts related to product sales contracts  including product sales under long term contracts 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record provisions for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
we believe our reserves are adequate  however  should future sales forecasts change  our original estimates of obsolescence could increase by a significant amount requiring additional reserves 
impairment of goodwill we perform a test for the impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
because we have a single operating and reportable business segment the transaction processing segment  we perform this test by comparing the fair value of the transaction processing segment with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the transaction processing segment exceeds the book value  goodwill is not impaired 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  we would calculate the potential impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the book value 
if the implied goodwill is less than the book value  a write down would be recorded 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets whenever indicators of impairment are present 
indicators of impairment include such items as declines in revenues and earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the economic or political stability of a particular country  which may indicate that the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable 
if facts and circumstances indicate that our long lived assets may be impaired  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with these long lived assets would be compared to their carrying amounts to determine if a write down to fair value is necessary 
effect of new accounting pronouncements during the first quarter of this fiscal year  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired 
intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
in connection with the adoption of this new standard  we determined that goodwill with a net book value of million met the standards intangible asset recognition criteria 
accordingly  we reclassified this amount during fiscal into intangible assets and we will continue to amortize it over its remaining useful life 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
among other things  sfas rescinds statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and eliminates the requirement that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effects  unless the criteria in accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions are met 
we elected to early adopt sfas on august  the first day of our fiscal third quarter 
as a result  we reclassified the million extraordinary charge and associated million tax benefit we recorded in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year into other income expense and income taxes in our consolidated income statements  respectively 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas supersedes emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in interim and annual financial statements about the obligations under certain guarantees 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of fin during our fiscal fourth quarter 
fin also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not currently provide significant guarantees that would require recognition under fin as a result  we do not currently believe this interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
the final consensus is applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  with early adoption permitted 
additionally  companies will be allowed to apply the guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes 
we are required to adopt the provisions of this eitf beginning on august  the first day of our fiscal third quarter 
we do not expect the adoption of this eitf to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity as defined by its primary beneficiary 
primary beneficiaries are those companies that are subject to a majority of the risk of loss or entitled to receive a majority of the variable interest entity s residual returns  or both 
in determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  a company with a variable interest must also treat a variable interest held by the company s related parties in that same entity as its own interests 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities that are created after or for which control is obtained after january  for variable interest entities created prior to february   the provisions of fin would be applied in the fiscal quarter beginning after june  our third quarter of fiscal 
we have a limited partnership interest in west greenwich technology associates  lp the partnership  which we currently account for under the equity method of accounting 
we are currently assessing the requirements to consolidate the partnership in accordance with fin should the partnership require consolidation  we would be required to initially measure and record the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the partnership at their fair values in our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  we would record our world headquarters facilities owned by the partnership as an asset  and the partnership s debt obligation as a liability in our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
common stock split in the first quarter of this fiscal year  our board of directors approved a for common stock split that was distributed in the form of a stock dividend on may  to shareholders of record on may  all references to common shares and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the stock split for all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and footnotes

the following discussion on service revenues should be read in conjunction with the table below in millions fiscal year ended change february  february  service revenues domestic lottery international lottery commercial services all other service revenues  including lottery and other services  were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  up million  or 
this increase was primarily driven by a million increase in international lottery service revenues and an million increase in domestic lottery services revenues  partially offset by the expiration of certain electronic benefit transfer contracts 
had last year s average exchange rates prevailed throughout fiscal  we estimate that service revenues would have increased by approximately compared to last year 
our international lottery service revenues were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  up million  or 
this increase was primarily driven by several new international contracts  along with higher service revenues from colombia 
these positive factors were partially offset by lower service revenues resulting from the weakening of the brazilian real against the us dollar 
our domestic lottery service revenues were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  up million  or 
this increase was primarily due to same store sales growth of approximately and the impact of new contracts  partially offset by contractual rate changes 
service revenues from commercial transaction processing services primarily in brazil  were down slightly from the prior year due to the weakening of the brazilian real against the us dollar 
in local currency  commercial transaction processing service revenues increased approximately over the prior year 
product sales were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  down million  or 
product sales in the prior year included significant sales of terminals and software to our customer in the united kingdom 
the absence of these sales in fiscal was partially offset by the sale of a turnkey lottery system to our customer in portugal during the current fiscal year 
our service margins improved from in fiscal to in fiscal prior year service margins were negatively impacted by the write off of assets and reserves associated with the economic instability in argentina and impairment charges relating to an under performing international contract 
fiscal service margins benefited from same store sales growth  new contracts that generated incrementally higher gross margins  lower depreciation principally related to contract extensions and fully depreciated assets associated with existing contracts  and improved operational and service delivery efficiencies 
our product margins improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal fiscal product margins were negatively impacted by inventory reserves recorded in connection with a product sale contract with a customer in italy 
operating expenses were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  down million  or 
this decrease was primarily driven by our continued execution of cost savings initiatives and emphasis on improving operating efficiencies  along with the benefit of the adoption of the new accounting standard on goodwill  which eliminated approximately million of goodwill amortization during the current year 
in addition  we recorded a credit against the special charge taken in fiscal of million  which reflects lower than anticipated severance costs associated with the fiscal value assessment of our business operations 
these declines in operating expenses were partially offset by increased spending on research and development in an effort to accelerate deployment of our enterprise series platform in the marketplace 
as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses were and during fiscal and  respectively 
equity income was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  up million  or  primarily due to equity income from the first full year of operations of our joint venture in taiwan

in connection with this repurchase  we recorded charges of million  principally comprised of tender premiums to the holders of the notes  net of gains on interest rate swaps  along with make whole premiums associated with the refinancing of our world headquarters facilities 
interest expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  down million  or 
this decrease was primarily due to our debt refinancing in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year and the third quarter of this fiscal year  resulting in lower debt balances and lower interest rates 
in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year  we issued million principal amount of convertible debentures debentures 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the debentures to retire million of senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal and we used cash on hand to repurchase the remaining million of series a senior notes in the third quarter of fiscal weighted average diluted shares in fiscal declined million shares to million shares as a result of our share repurchase programs  resulting in an improvement to diluted earnings per share of approximately 
our debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share when our stock closes at or above per share for out of consecutive trading days 
for fiscal and  million shares issuable upon the conversion of the debentures were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because  in accordance with their terms  the debentures had not yet become convertible 
since december  when we issued the debentures  the first time our common stock closed at or above per share was on march  from march  through april   our common stock closed above per share on out of trading days

in addition  cost over runs on system installations in new south wales  australia and israel adversely impacted fiscal margins

our business is capital intensive 
we currently estimate that net cash to be used for investing activities in fiscal will be in the range of million to million  excluding investments that will be required under the proposed acquisitions of polcard and interlott and investments that may be required under the terms of our memorandum of understanding mou with the state of rhode island the state  the rhode island economic development corporation and the city of providence  rhode island 
negotiations respecting the mou are ongoing and subject to the passage of legislation by the state  the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements  and certain other contingencies 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the transactions contemplated by the mou will be consummated  or if they are consummated  that they will not be on terms that differ materially from the terms currently in the mou 
see part  item business developments since the close of fiscal  above 
assuming that the polcard and interlott acquisitions are consummated in june and july  respectively  we currently estimate that net cash to be used for investing activities in fiscal for the purchase of these businesses and investing activities subsequent to acquisition  will be in the range of million to million 
in addition  we plan to issue approximately  shares of our common stock held in treasury to complete the acquisition of interlott 
in connection with the terms of the mou  we are to invest at least million in the state through december   in part  with respect to the relocation of our world corporate headquarters 
because negotiations respecting the arrangements described in the mou are ongoing  and in any event are subject to the passage of legislation by the state  the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements  and certain other contingencies  we are unable to estimate investing activity in fiscal with respect to the mou 
we expect our principal sources of liquidity to be existing cash balances  along with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
our credit facility provides for an unsecured revolving line of credit of million and matures in june as of february   there were no borrowings under the credit facility 
we currently expect that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our anticipated working capital and ordinary capital expenditure needs  to service our debt obligations  to fund anticipated internal growth  to fund potential acquisitions  to fund the capital requirements under the mou as currently contemplated  and to repurchase shares of our common stock  from time to time  under our share repurchase programs 
not withstanding the foregoing  we may seek alternative sources of financing to fund certain of our obligations under the mou

market risk disclosures the primary market risk inherent in our financial instruments and exposures is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates 
our exposure to commodity price changes is not considered material and is managed through our procurement and sales practices 
we did not own any marketable equity securities in fiscal interest rates interest rate market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of our total debt or current earnings resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates 
at february   the estimated fair value of our million of fixed rate senior notes approximated million as determined by an independent investment banker 
a hypothetical adverse or favorable change in interest rates applied to the fixed rate senior notes would not have a material effect on current earnings 
at february   the estimated fair value of our million principal amount of convertible debentures was million as determined by an independent investment banker 
at february   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would reduce the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures to million and a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would increase the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures to million 
a hypothetical adverse or favorable change in interest rates applied to variable rate debt would not have a material effect on current earnings 
we use various techniques to mitigate the risk associated with future changes in interest rates  including entering into interest rate swaps 
we had million of interest rate swap agreements in place on our fixed rate senior notes  which effectively entitled us to exchange fixed rate payments for variable rate payments until may during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold all of these interest rate swaps for million 
approximately million of these proceeds will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense through the due date of the series b senior notes may 
approximately million of the remaining proceeds were recorded as other income expense in our consolidated income statements in connection with the extinguishment of the series a senior notes during the third quarter of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information

in connection with this repurchase  we recorded net charges of million  principally comprised of tender premiums to the holders of the notes  net of proceeds from the sale of interest rate swaps associated with the notes 
this amount is included in other income expense in our consolidated income statements 
equity price risk at february   the estimated fair value of our million principal amount of convertible debentures was million as determined by an independent investment banker 
at february   a hypothetical increase in the market price of our common stock would increase the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures to million and a hypothetical decrease in the market price of our common stock would reduce the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures to million 
foreign currency exchange rates we are subject to foreign exchange exposures arising from current and anticipated transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency united states dollars and from the translation of foreign currency balance sheet accounts into united states dollar balance sheet accounts 
we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk by securing payment from our customers in united states dollars  by sharing risk with our customers  by utilizing foreign currency borrowings  by leading and lagging receipts and payments  and by entering into foreign currency exchange and option contracts 
in addition  a significant portion of the costs attributable to our foreign currency revenues are payable in the local currencies 
in limited circumstances  but whenever possible  we negotiate clauses into our contracts that allow for price adjustments should a material change in foreign exchange rates occur 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange and option contracts to reduce the exposure associated with current transactions and anticipated transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
however  we do not engage in foreign currency speculation 
at february  and february   a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in a translation loss of million and million  respectively  that would be recorded in the equity section of our balance sheet 
at february  and february   a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in a net transaction loss of million and million  respectively  that would be recorded in current earnings after considering the effects of foreign exchange contracts currently in place 
at february   a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would result in a net reduction of cash flows from anticipatory transactions in fiscal of million  after considering the effects of foreign exchange contracts currently in place
