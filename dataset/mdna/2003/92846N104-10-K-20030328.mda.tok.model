new product acceptance the company s success depends on its ability to successfully market its vitrea software for clinical use  and the ability and willingness of physicians to use two and three dimensional medical imaging software in disease screening  clinical diagnosis and therapy planning and other diagnosis  surgical  and treatment protocols 
the three dimensional medical imaging software offered by vitrea represents a new alternative to the conventional methods traditionally used for viewing medical images in the clinical setting 
the acceptance of vitrea by physicians and other clinicians will depend on the company s ability to educate those users as to the speed  ease of use and other benefits offered by the vitrea system  as well as the timely introduction of new features and functions by the company 
there can be no assurance that users will prefer three dimensional medical imaging software over less expensive two dimensional medical imaging software  or that the company will succeed in its efforts to further develop  commercialize  and achieve market acceptance for its vitrea product or for any other product in the clinical setting 
see business technology  industry background  markets and competition 
substantial reliance on a single product revenue from sales of the vitrea system constituted of the company s total revenue for the year ended december   of the company s total revenue for the year ended december  and of the company s total revenue for the year ended december  further  the company anticipates that revenue from the sale of vitrea will continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s revenue for the foreseeable future 
as such  the failure of physicians to accept vitrea would have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on market growth the d medical imaging industry in which the company markets its products is still developing due to the fairly recent availability of high performance computers at reduced prices  the recent adoption of industry standards for the generation  transmission and storage of medical imaging data  and changing medical practices 
historically  there has been a perception that three dimensional imaging was too slow or difficult for clinical use 
this perception was due largely to the relatively slower processing speed of workstations available in the past 
although the company believes that the recent advances in the affordability of high performance computers and in the development of industry standards for the generation  transmission  and storage of imaging data will provide opportunities for growth in the d medical imaging industry  given the uncertainties associated with the developing stage of this industry  there can be no assurance that it will continue to develop in the manner anticipated by the company 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the d medical imaging industry will provide growth opportunities for the company and its software products or that the company s business strategies will be successful as the d medical imaging industry continues to evolve 
ultimately  if the d medical imaging industry fails to develop as the company expects  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
need for additional capital if the company s operations progress as anticipated  of which there can be no assurance  the company believes that its existing cash balances  together with cash flows from operations  should be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next months 
the timing of the company s future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the ability of vital images to successfully market its products  the ability and willingness of physicians to use two and three dimensional medical imaging software in disease screening  clinical diagnosis and therapy planning and other diagnosis  surgical  and treatment protocols  the impact of competition in the d medical imaging business  the ability of the company to differentiate its products from competing products  the capital equipment budget constraints of some potential purchasers  the ability of the company to build an effective sales and distribution force  and the ability to enhance existing products and develop new products on a timely basis 
to the extent that the company s operations do not progress as anticipated  additional capital may be required 
there can be no assurance that any required additional capital will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and the failure to obtain any such required capital would have a material adverse effect on vital images business 
the issuance of additional equity securities may result in dilution of current shareholder voting and ownership interests

highly competitive industry the company faces intense competition in the d medical imaging industry 
the company expects technology to continue to develop rapidly  and the company s success will depend to a large extent on its ability to maintain a competitive position with its products 
companies competing with the company in the d medical imaging industry include large  established manufacturers of ct and mr imaging equipment 
companies such as ge medical systems  siemens medical systems  inc and philips medical systems typically offer their own medical imaging software and workstations as part of their integrated imaging and scanner systems 
the company s ability to successfully market and sell its current d medical imaging products to prospective customers depends  in part  on its ability to persuade such customers to separate the purchase of ct or mr equipment from the selection and purchase of d medical imaging workstations 
in addition to having significantly greater capital and staffing resources for research and development that are critical to success in the rapidly changing d medical imaging industry  such companies also have well established marketing and distribution networks and have a competitive advantage in marketing d medical imaging tools as an integrated part of their imaging products 
while price has been less significant than other factors  increasing competition may result in price reductions and reduced gross margins 
additionally  the company faces competition from other entities  such as other software suppliers  information storage and retrieval vendors  hospital  radiology and clinical systems suppliers and internal development projects sponsored by hospital radiology departments 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively with such manufacturers or competing entities 
see business technology  industry background and competition 
risk of technological obsolescence the d medical imaging market is characterized by rapid innovation and technological change 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively in the marketplace or that products developed by its competitors will not render its products obsolete or non competitive 
similarly  there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing products that are viewed as providing superior clinical performance or are less expensive than the company s products currently marketed or to be developed 
dependence on major customers one of the company s principal distribution channels is to sell its vitrea medical imaging software for inclusion with the delivery of medical imaging equipment being sold by toshiba corporation  medical systems company toshiba 
sales by the company to toshiba accounted for approximately  and of the company s total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
management believes a limited number of large customers may continue to account for a significant portion of the company s revenue during any given period for the foreseeable future 
except for its marketing and distribution agreements with toshiba  medtronic snt and e z em  inc  the company currently has no long term purchase or other agreements with any of its customers and sales are generally made pursuant to purchase orders 
a reduction  delay  or cancellation of orders from one or more of its significant customers likely would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
see business marketing and distribution 
impact of purchase commitments in november  the company entered into an agreement with r technology  inc r to distribute r s lung nodule cad software product lung cad product in conjunction with the company s products 
upon the later of either the date on which r is able to meet ce certification requirements and produce a declaration of conformance for the lung cad product or the completion of the milestones in the development plan with respect to the lung cad product that will be distributed in europe  the company is required to begin purchasing the lung cad product over the next three years 
the total purchase commitment will be to a maximum of million worth of product over the three year commitment period 
the purchase commitment price the company has to pay will be reduced if the selling price of the lung cad product when sold directly to end users by r falls below a specified price 
fluctuations in operating results the company may experience significant fluctuations in future annual and quarterly operating results 
if these fluctuations occur  they may result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the timing of significant orders  the timing of product enhancements and new product introductions by the company  its competitors and its customers  the pricing of the company s products  changes in customers budgets  and competitive conditions  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
government regulation the company s products are subject to regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the development  introduction  manufacturing  labeling and record keeping procedures for medical devices  including d medical imaging software and systems 
the process of obtaining marketing clearance from the fda for new products and new applications for existing products can be time consuming and expensive 
all of the current products actively marketed by the company have received marketing clearance from the fda pursuant to k pre market notifications 
vitrea has been approved to be marketed for use with ct and mr scanners  the company s vscore options have been approved for use in coronary artery calcium scoring and the company s ct brain perfusion option has been cleared for analyzing the blood flow of stroke victims 
there can be no assurance  however  that clearance will be granted with respect to future products or enhancements  or that fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect the company s ability to market such future products or enhancements 
in addition  there can be no assurance that future products or enhancements will not be subject to the more lengthy and expensive pre market approval process with the fda 
even if regulatory approvals to market a product are obtained from the fda  these approvals may entail limitations on the indicated uses of the product 
product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 
the fda could also limit or prevent the distribution of the company s products and has the power to require the recall of such products 
fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation  and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies will not adversely affect the company 
the fda may inspect the company and its facilities from time to time to determine whether the company is in compliance with various regulations relating to specification  development  documentation  validation  testing  quality control and product labeling 
a determination that the company is in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of civil penalties  including fines  product recalls or product seizures and  in extreme cases  criminal sanctions 
the company markets its products both domestically and internationally 
international regulatory bodies have established varying regulations governing product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
the inability or failure of the company to comply with the varying regulations or the imposition of new regulations could restrict its ability to sell its products internationally and could thereby adversely affect the company s business

health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa the hipaa regulations are causing customers of the company to request that the company sign business associate agreements with them 
a business associate is a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of  or provides services to  a covered entity 
by law  the hipaa privacy rule applies only to covered entities health plans  health care clearinghouses  and certain health care providers 
however  most health care providers do not carry out all of their health care activities and functions by themselves 
instead  they often use the services of a variety of other persons or businesses 
the privacy rule allows covered providers and health plans to disclose protected health information to these business associates if the providers or plans obtain satisfactory assurances that the business associate will use the information only for the purposes for which it was engaged by the covered entity  will safeguard the information from misuse  and will help the covered entity comply with some of the covered entity s duties under the privacy rule 
covered entities may disclose protected health information to an entity in its role as a business associate only to help the covered entity carry out its health care functions not for the business associate s independent use or purposes  except as needed for the proper management and administration of the business associate 
if the company is not willing to or is unable to enter into a business associate agreement with current and potential customers  the customer may not purchase products and services from the company and this would have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
uncertain protection for intellectual property  possible claims of others although the company has filed patent applications with respect to certain aspects of its technology  it generally does not rely on patent protection with respect to its products and technologies 
instead  the company relies primarily on a combination of trade secret and copyright law  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect intellectual property rights pertaining to its products and technologies 
there can be no assurance that these measures will provide meaningful protection of the company s trade secrets  know how or other intellectual property in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure or that others will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by the company 
in addition  to the extent that any patents are applied for  there can be no assurance that such applications will result in issued patents or  if issued  that such patents will be held to be valid or will otherwise be of value 
while the company does not believe that its products and technologies infringe any existing patents or intellectual property rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that such infringement does not exist 
the costs of prosecuting or defending an intellectual property claim could be substantial and could adversely affect the company  even if it was ultimately successful in prosecuting or defending any such claims 
if the company s products or technologies were found to infringe the rights of a third party  the company could be required to pay significant damages or license fees or cease production  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business

product liability risk  limited insurance coverage the manufacture and sale of products used in the practice of medicine entail significant risk of product liability claims 
while the company currently maintains product liability insurance in the amount of  per occurrence and  in total and also maintains errors and omissions coverage in the amount of  per occurrence and in total  there can be no assurance that its coverage limits will be adequate to protect the company from any liabilities it might incur in connection with the sale of its products  or that the company will be able to maintain this level of coverage in the future 
the company also may require increased product liability coverage as additional products and updates are released 
such insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful product liability claim or series of such claims against the company in excess of the company s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on its business 
dependence on key employee  need to hire additional personnel the company depends upon the continued active participation of dr 
vincent j 
argiro  its chief technology officer and founder 
loss of the services of dr 
argiro could have a material adverse effect on the company s future business 
dr 
argiro does not have an employment agreement with the company  but he does have a confidentiality and non competition agreement with the company 
the company maintains key person life insurance coverage on dr 
argiro s life in the amount of  the company s ability to enhance and develop markets for its current products as well as to introduce new products to the marketplace also depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and management personnel 
the company competes for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and organizations  many of which have substantially greater capital resources  name recognition  and research and development capabilities than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in recruiting or retaining such personnel 
the inability of the company to recruit and retain such personnel would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
management of growth the execution of the company s business plan will place increasing demands on the company s existing management and resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage any expansion of its business  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on third party reimbursement the company s products are purchased by hospitals  clinics  imaging centers and other users  which bill various third party payers  such as government health programs  private health insurance plans  managed care organizations and other similar programs  for the health care goods and services provided to their patients 
there is currently a current procedural terminology cpt reimbursement code for procedures that utilize the company s products 
however  the amount of such reimbursement varies by location and is subject to change 
payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a product used in a procedure was not used in accordance with established payer protocol regarding cost effective treatment methods or was used for an unapproved indication 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical services and  in some instances  have put pressure on service providers to lower their prices or reduce their services 
the company is unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods used by third party healthcare payers 
there can be no assurance that procedures in which the company s products are used will be considered cost effective by third party payers  that reimbursement for such procedures will be available or  if available  that payers reimbursement levels will not adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
in addition  there have been and may continue to be proposals by legislators  regulators and third party payers to curb further these costs in the future 
failure by hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain reimbursement from third party payers  changes in third party payers policies toward reimbursement for procedures using the company s products or legislative action could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
see business third party reimbursement and cost containment 
uncertainty of health care reform the levels of revenue and profitability of medical technology companies may be affected by the efforts of government and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means 
in the united states there have been  and the company expects that there will continue to be  a number of federal  state  and private proposals to control health care costs 
these proposals may contain measures intended to control public and private spending on health care as well as to provide universal public access to the health care system 
if enacted  these proposals may result in a substantial restructuring of the health care delivery system 
significant changes in the nation s health care system could have a substantial impact on the manner in which the company conducts its business and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
possible issuances of preferred stock  certain anti takeover considerations the company s articles of incorporation authorize the company s board of directors  without any action by its shareholders  to establish the rights and preferences of up to  shares of currently undesignated preferred stock 
such shares of preferred stock could possess voting and conversion rights  which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock and may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
no shares of preferred stock or other senior equity securities are currently designated and currently there is no plan to designate or to issue any such securities 
the company is also subject to certain anti takeover provisions of the minnesota business corporation act 
in addition  the company has adopted a shareholder rights plan the rights agreement designed to protect the company and its shareholders from unsolicited attempts to acquire the company 
these measures may  in certain circumstances  deter or discourage takeover attempts and other changes in control of the company not approved by its board of directors and may have a depressive effect on any market for the company s stock 
as a result  the company s shareholders may lose opportunities to dispose of their shares at the higher prices typically available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal 
in addition  these measures may have the effect of permitting the company s current directors to retain their positions and place them in a better position to resist changes that the company s shareholders may wish to make if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of the company s business 
no dividends the company has not paid cash dividends on its common stock in the past and does not intend to do so in the foreseeable future 
limitations on director liability as permitted by minnesota law  the company s articles of incorporation provide that a director of the company shall not be personally liable to the company or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director  with certain exceptions 
these provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by shareholders on behalf of the company against a director 
in addition  the company s bylaws provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by minnesota law 
item properties the company s principal office is located in plymouth  minnesota  where the company currently occupies approximately  square feet under a lease that expires july  under certain conditions contained in the lease  the company has the option to expand its facilities

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following represents those critical accounting policies and estimates where materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects the company s estimate of losses that may result from the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based primarily on an analysis of individual accounts for which the company has information indicating the customer may not be able to pay amounts owed to the company 
in these cases  based on the available facts and circumstances  the company estimates the amount that will be collected from such customers 
the company also evaluates the collectibility of our accounts receivable in the aggregate based on factors such as the aging of receivable amounts  customer concentrations  historical experience  and current economic trends and conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted when additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
if circumstances change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be reduced or increased by a material amount 
such a change in estimated recoverability would be accounted for in the period in which the facts that give rise to the change become known 
as of december   the company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of  deferred tax asset 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
presently the company maintains a valuation allowance to offset all of its net deferred tax asset 
while the company has considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such a determination was made and such a determination will become more likely if the company continues to generate income 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
as of december   the company has recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of  despite the full valuation allowance  the income tax benefits related to these deferred tax assets will remain available to offset future taxable income 
long lived assets 
the company periodically reviews the carrying amounts of property and equipment and intangible assets purchased in the normal course of business to determine whether current events or circumstances  as defined in statement of financial accounting standard no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  warrant adjustments to such carrying amounts 
in reviewing the carrying values of property and equipment and intangible assets purchased in the normal course of business the company considers  among other things  the future cash flows expected from the use of the asset 
to the extent these estimated cash flows significantly change  an impairment would be identified 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants 
license fees revenue is derived from the licensing of computer software 
hardware revenue is derived from the sale of system hardware  including peripheral equipment 
maintenance and service revenue is derived from hardware and software maintenance and from services consisting of installation  training and engineering services 
in software arrangements that include the rights to multiple software products  system hardware  specified upgrades  maintenance or services  the company allocates the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each of the deliverables determined based on vendor specific objective evidence 
in software arrangements in which the company does not have vendor specific objective evidence  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when vendor specific objective evidence is determined for the undelivered elements residual method or when all elements have been delivered 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
revenue allocable to maintenance is recognized on a straight line basis over the periods in which it is provided 
the company evaluates arrangements that include services to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
generally  the company s services are not considered essential to the functionality of other elements  and accordingly  revenue allocable to services is recognized as the services are performed 
in arrangements where the company is performing significant customization or modification of software  revenue from the arrangements is recognized using contract accounting  generally on a percentage of completion basis 
hardware revenue is recognized upon shipment when all other revenue recognition criteria in the arrangement have been met 
revenue total revenue increased to  in from total revenue of  in total revenue increased to  in compared with  in the revenue growth was driven by the increase in the company s core revenue components of software license fees and maintenance and service revenue 
license fee revenue increased to  in from  in the increase in software license fee revenue was driven primarily by an increase in the number of vitrea licenses sold and an increase in the number of vitrea add on options sold 
license fee revenue increased to  in from  in the increase in software license fee revenue was driven by an increase in the number of vitrea licenses sold as well as an increase in the number of vitrea add on options sold 
maintenance and services revenue increased to  in from  in and increased to  in from  in the increases were primarily due to increases in maintenance revenue as the company added new customers to the installed base and increases in training revenue due to an increase in the number of training sessions sold with customer purchases of software and add on options

the hardware revenue growth was lower in than in due to a change in the sales model with toshiba america medical systems  inc tams 
prior to the third quarter of  all of the company s sales to tams were complete systems sales 
beginning in the third quarter of  most of the revenue resulting from sales to tams was derived from software only sales  which generate higher margins than complete system sales 
the company had a license agreement with paradigm geophysical corporation paradigm  which expired in january revenue received under the license agreement with paradigm was  and  in and  respectively 
gross margin the company s gross margin percentage was in  up from in the gross margin percentage was in the increase in gross margin for and was primarily attributable to a change in the sales model with tams as discussed above and an increase in software only sales to international resellers including toshiba 
the vitrea system  consisting of vitrea software and third party hardware and peripherals  is designed to offer end users an integrated d medical imaging system 
the company receives a nominal discount in purchasing the third party hardware and peripheral components of the vitrea system  and the company s gross margin on the resale of these system components approximates its discount 
the company anticipates that software license fee revenue as a percentage of the company s total revenue will increase modestly in future periods and  therefore  management believes the overall gross margin percentage will increase modestly in future periods 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were  or of total revenue   or of total revenue and  or of total revenue  for  and  respectively 
the increases in sales and marketing expenses from to and to were primarily due to increased compensation costs as a result of additional personnel and increased sales commissions as a result of increased revenue 
tradeshow and marketing costs increased from to  primarily due to the company purchasing more space at tradeshows and attending additional tradeshows 
depreciation expense increased in as compared with  primarily due to equipment purchases used for the additional personnel  upgrades of computer equipment and equipment for tradeshows 
during these periods  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue declined primarily due to the company s ability to generate revenue growth without proportionately increasing sales and marketing costs 
the company expects sales and marketing costs to increase in future periods primarily as a result of the cost of additional sales and customer support personnel 
however  management expects sales and marketing expenses to decline as a percentage of total revenue in research and development research and development expenses were up to  or of total revenue in from  or of total revenue  in in addition   of expenses were classified in cost of revenue during in connection with engineering services provided to others under various product development agreements

research and development expenses were up to  or of total revenue in from  or of total revenue  in the increase was primarily due to increased compensation costs resulting from additional personnel supporting the development of vitrea  the amortization of licensed technology and increases in expenses to support clinical collaboration sites 
there were also consecutive increases in annual depreciation expense between and  primarily as the result of equipment purchases to support the additional personnel and to upgrade computer equipment 
the decreases in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue during these periods reflect the company s ability to generate increased revenue more rapidly than it increases its product development costs 
the company anticipates that research and development costs will increase in future periods as the company develops software tools for applications with large potential markets  such as cardiovascular disease  disease screening applications such as colon cancer  and surgical and therapy planning 
however  management expects research and development costs to decline as a percentage of total revenue in general and administrative general and administrative expenses were  or of total revenue   or of total revenue and  or of total revenue  in  and  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily due to severance costs of  for the company s former chief executive officer  higher insurance costs due to the growth of the company as well as premium rate increases  an increase in consulting fees and increased travel costs related to investor relations and business development 
the increase from to was primarily due to compensation costs increasing due to additional personnel and increases in professional fees incurred in establishing partnering agreements 
the decreases in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue during these periods reflect the company s ability to limit operating costs while increasing revenue 
the company believes that general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods due to increased infrastructure costs as the business grows  but that they will continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenue in operating income loss the increasing revenue from vitrea and add on software options and related service revenues  net of the increased expenses attributable to the development of the company s infrastructure and the development and promotion of the vitrea product  resulted in an operating income of  for compared with an operating loss of  for and an operating loss of  for interest income there was  of interest income for  compared with  in and  in the increase in interest income from to was primarily due to an increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily due to the exercise of warrants for the purchase of common stock  which generated approximately  and  in proceeds for the years of ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income from to was primarily due to a lower balance of cash and cash equivalents throughout the year as a result of the use of cash to fund the company s operations 
income taxes the income tax provisions for  and consist solely of certain state minimum fees 
as a result of the company s history of generating net operating losses  the company has established a valuation allowance to completely reserve for the deferred tax asset of the company 
the company continues to monitor realizability of this benefit related to its net deferred tax asset 
to the extent management estimates that realization of this benefit is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income  part or all of the valuation will be reversed

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors such as liquidity will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes  and it does not enter into forward financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates because  as disclosed above  substantially all of the company s foreign transactions are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
based on the controls in place and the relative size of the financial instruments entered into  the company believes the risks associated with not using these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition  the company does not engage in speculative transactions and does not use derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
see the notes to financial statements for a description of the company s accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates and price changes that could affect the company s operating results 
as of december   fluctuations in interest rates  exchange rates and price changes would not have a material effect on the company s financial position or operating results 
interest rate risk the company places its cash and cash equivalents  which generally have a term of less than days  with a high quality financial institution and has investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately  due to the short term nature of these instruments  the carrying value approximates market value 
if  during  average short term interest rates decreased by over average rates  the company s projected interest income from short term investments would decrease by approximately  assuming a similar level of investments in price risk as of december   the company held marketable securities with an aggregate fair market value of  all of the company s marketable securities are classified as available for sale and all  except  mature in one year or less 
the remaining  of marketable securities had a contractual maturity date in september but was called in march of available for sale investments are recorded at market value  which is based on quoted market prices  with unrealized holding gains and losses included as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the company uses a specific identification cost method to determine the gross realized gains and losses on the sale of its securities 
had market prices of such securities declined as of december   the values of these instruments would have decreased by  foreign currency risk substantially all of the company s foreign transactions are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
therefore  fluctuations in the value of the dollar as compared to other foreign currencies have not had an effect on the company
