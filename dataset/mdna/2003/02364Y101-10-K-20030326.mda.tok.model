per bac for all years prior to the date of the merger 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company was formed for the purpose of acquiring  holding  operating  selling and otherwise dealing primarily with multifamily residential properties  including the acquisition of debt and equity securities of entities engaged in similar activities 
the company began operations on december   when it merged with capital source lp cap source i or the predecessor and capital source ii lp a cap source ii with the company being the surviving entity 
as a result of the merger and subsequent acquisitions  at december   the company now directly owns multifamily apartment complexes and two limited partnership interests in two operating partnerships 
the company s business objectives are to i provide increased cash distributions to investors  ii provide a potential for an increase in net asset value  and iii provide enhanced liquidity and market value of its units 
management s strategy to meet these objectives includes acquiring investments in multifamily residential properties and acquiring securities of other entities engaged in similar real estate business 
on january   the company acquired the general partner interests in eight of the ten operating partnerships from its general partner for no consideration 
as a result of this acquisition  the company now owns of the eight operating partnerships and presents the results of each operating partnership as a wholly owned subsidiary from the date of acquisition 
prior to the acquisition  the company owned only the limited partnership interests of the eight operating partnerships  which ranged from 
in march  the company acquired the glades apartments  a unit apartment property located in jacksonville  florida 
the million acquisition was financed through the assumption of bonds payable of million and cash of approximately million 
in september  the company acquired the lakes of northdale apartments  a unit apartment property located in tampa  florida 
the million acquisition was financed through the assumption of bonds payable of million and cash of approximately million 
the company s operating results depend primarily on income from its multifamily properties  which is substantially influenced by i supply of and demand for apartment units  ii operating expense levels  and iii property level operations 
the multifamily real estate industry is experiencing soft market conditions in most markets nationwide  including those in which certain of the company s properties operate 
these conditions are attributable to a general deterioration of economic conditions  more market competition  and competition from single family homes 
as a result of the above  the company s properties have experienced a decline in the physical and economic occupancy levels of its properties 
at december   the average physical occupancy of the company s properties was  compared to at december  for the year ended december   the average economic occupancy of the company s properties was  compared to for the year ended december  in response to these conditions  management continues to actively manage each property to maximize the net operating income from each 
this includes the employment of innovative on site marketing techniques with a strong focus on resident retention and the negotiation and management of operating expenses 
as a result  management believes the properties will continue to perform at reasonable levels during these conditions and will be well situated for growth when the conditions turn more favorable 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the company s real estate investments as of december

critical accounting policies the company defines its critical accounting policies as those which entail judgment and estimation in their application and considers its critical accounting policies to be the i accounting for and valuation of its investment in real estate assets  and ii accounting for and valuation of its investment in operating partnerships 
investment in real estate the company s investment in real estate is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of real estate is based on the estimated useful life of the property or years on multifamily residential apartments using the straight line method 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
capital improvements and certain betterment projects exceeding  per project are capitalized and depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful life 
misapplication of the company s capitalization and depreciation policies may have a significant impact on the financial statements 
management reviews each property for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based upon comparing the net book value of each real estate property to its estimated fair value  calculated as the undiscounted future cash flows 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value 
the recognition of an impaired property and the potential impairment calculation are subject to a considerable degree of judgment  the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements 
the calculation of estimated future cash flows includes certain variables such as the assumed inflation rates for rents and expenses  capitalization rates and discount rates 
in certain cases  additional factors such as the replacement value of the property or comparable sales of similar properties are also taken into consideration 
different conditions or different assumptions applied to the calculation would likely result in materially different results 
the company does periodically compare the results of its estimates with historical results to evaluate the reasonableness and accuracy of its estimates and adjusts its estimates accordingly 
investment in operating partnerships the investment in operating partnerships consists of interests in limited partnerships which own multifamily residential properties 
the investments in operating partnerships are accounted for using the equity method as the company has significant influence  but not control over the operating partnerships 
as such  the company records its proportionate share of the operating partnerships income or losses 
the investments in the operating partnerships were recorded at the cost to acquire such interests 
the company suspends recognizing losses in the operating partnerships when its entire investment becomes consumed by such losses 
losses are then recognized only to the extent of additional contributions  net of distributions received  to the operating partnerships by the company 
cash distributions received from operating partnerships whose entire investment has been reduced to zero through the recognition of proportionate losses are recognized as income when received by the company 
the company is not the general partner of the operating partnerships and has determined it does not have a legal obligation to provide additional cash support  nor has it indicated any commitment to provide this support 
accordingly  the investment in such operating partnerships has not been reduced below zero 
cash distributions received from operating partnerships whose entire investment has not been reduced to zero through the recognition of proportionate losses is recorded as a reduction of the company s investment in the respective operating partnership 
such operating partnerships include the former capital source ii assets  which were recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of the merger  and operating partnerships in which the company has made additional equity investments 
it is the policy of the company to make a periodic review of the estimated fair value of the properties underlying the operating partnerships using the same methodology described above 
results of operations the tables below compare the results of operations for each year shown 

imagegif 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the results of operations for the years ended december  and are not fully comparable to each other due to i the acquisitions of huntsview apartments and brentwood oaks apartments in september and december  respectively  ii the consolidation of eight of the operating partnerships which became effective on january   and iii the acquisitions of the glades apartments and lakes of northdale apartments in march and september  respectively 
as a result  there are significant changes in the company s reported financial results  most notably in rental income  equity in earnings losses  real estate operating expenses  depreciation and interest expense 
these factors and others having an effect on the financial results are further described below 
rental income increased  from to this increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions and transactions described above 
in  the company directly owned one real estate property for three months  and one real estate property for less than one month 
in  the company directly owned ten real estate properties for the entire year  and two real estate properties were acquired during the year 
equity in the earnings of operating partnerships decreased  from to this decrease is primarily due to the january  consolidation of eight of the ten operating partnerships 
mortgage backed securities income decreased  from to  primarily as a result of the consolidation of eight of the ten operating partnerships and the related elimination entries for those operating partnerships which collateralize certain gnma certificates owned by the company 
another factor affecting this decrease is the payoff of three mortgage backed securities in and the continued amortization of the principal balances of the mortgage backed securities 
interest income on cash and cash equivalents decreased  or from to due to a decrease in the average balance of such investments and the decrease in rates earned thereon 
the average rate earned on such investments was during and decreased to in the decrease in the average balance is attributable to the purchase of corporate equity securities and acquisitions of real estate properties 
dividend income from the company s investment in corporate equity securities increased  from compared to due to additional acquisitions during the last quarter of that earned dividends the entire year of and acquisitions of additional investments in corporate equity securities of  during the fiscal year the company incurred real estate operating expenses of  during compared to  in this increase is attributable to i the acquisitions of brentwood oaks apartments in august and huntsview apartments in december  ii the january  acquisition of the general partner interests in eight of the operating partnerships which allowed the properties to consolidate their operations with the company  and iii the acquisitions of the glades apartments in march and lakes of northdale in september 
the company directly owned only two properties at december  compared to twelve at december  during  the company recorded depreciation expense of  compared to  in this increase is also attributable to i the acquisitions of brentwood oaks apartments in august and huntsview apartments in december  ii the january  acquisition of the general partner interests in eight of the operating partnerships  and iii the acquisitions of the glades apartments in march and lakes of northdale in september 
the company directly owned only two properties at december  compared to twelve at december  the company recorded  in amortization expense in compared to  in this increase is attributable to i the consolidation of eight of the ten operating partnerships  ii the acquisitions of the glades apartments and lakes of northdale apartments  and iii the write off of  of net unamortized debt financing costs in connection with the waterman s crossing debt refinancing 
the company incurred interest expense of  in on its i bonds and mortgage payable  ii notes payable originated in connection with the merger  and iii repurchase obligations 
this increased from  in and is primarily attributable to the consolidation of the operating partnerships and the acquisitions of the glades apartments and lakes of northdale apartments 
this increase was partially offset with declining interest rates on the company s notes payable and repurchase agreements 
operating and administrative expenses decreased  from to this is attributable to decreases of approximately  in salaries and  in servicing fees 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in asset management fees of approximately  due to the and real estate acquisitions 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in accordance with the purchase method of accounting  the results of operations for the year ended december  up until the date of the merger  december   are that of the predecessor cap source i only  and are therefore not comparable with the company s results of operations for the years ended december  and mortgage backed securities income increased  from to as a result of the merger 
slightly offsetting this increase are decreases due to the payoff of three mortgage backed securities in and the continued amortization of the principal balances of the mortgage backed securities 
interest income on cash and cash equivalents decreased  from to due to a decrease in the average balance of such investments and the decrease in rates earned thereon 
the decrease in the average balance is attributable to the purchase of corporate equity securities  acquisitions of real estate properties and the payment of distributions in accordance with the settlement 
the company earned dividend income of  on its investment in corporate equity securities which were acquired in the predecessor did not own corporate equity securities in and accordingly did not earn dividend income in the company earned rental income of  which is attributable to the acquisitions of brentwood oaks apartments in august and huntsview apartments in december 
the predecessor did not directly own any properties in and accordingly did not earn rental income in equity in the earnings of operating partnerships increased  from to this increase is primarily due to the effects of the merger 
in addition  during  the company received distributions totaling  from fox hollow apartments  highland park apartments  water s edge apartments  and bluff ridge apartments  compared to when the predecessor received distributions totaling  from the ponds at georgetown  highland park apartments and water s edge apartments 
such cash distributions from operating partnerships are recorded as income when received because the company s financial statement balance of these operating partnerships has been reduced to zero through the recognition of proportionate losses in excess of the company s investment 
these increases in cash distributions from the operating partnerships are due to increases in the net cash flows generated by the underlying properties 
the company incurred real estate operating expenses of  and depreciation expense of  in  which are attributable to the acquisitions of brentwood oaks apartments in august and huntsview apartments in december 
the predecessor did not directly own any properties in and  accordingly  did not incur real estate operating expenses or depreciation expense in the company incurred interest expense of  in on its i bonds and mortgage payable  ii notes payable originated in connection with the merger  and iii repurchase obligations 
the predecessor did not have borrowings and  accordingly  did not recognize interest expense during operating and administrative expenses increased  from to in  the company recorded  of legal fees incurred in connection with the settlement 
excluding such expense  operating and administrative fees increased  which is attributable to increases of i  in salaries and related expenses due to the merger  ii  in administrative fees due to the merger  and iii  in the company s other general and administrative expenses due to the merger 
funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo to be a key measure of its operating performance and liquidity 
although it is not a substitute for net income and cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  the company believes ffo is useful because it disregards the non cash expense items that reduce net income under gaap and disregards certain sources and uses of cash that do not reflect ongoing operations but which affect gaap cash flow from operating activities 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing cost and after comparable adjustments for an entity s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
the nareit standards may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies to calculate ffo 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income as an indication of the company s financial performance or to gaap cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
ffo may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of the company s net income as determined by gaap with its ffo for each of the last three years 

imagegif 
ffo increased  or for the year ended december   compared to and  or for the year ended december  compared to liquidity and capital resources the company s net cash generated by operating activities increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   principally due to the acquisition of the general partner interests in eight of the operating partnerships on january  and the acquisition of two properties in net cash used in investing activities increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  due to i the acquisition of the glades apartments and the lakes of northdale apartments during  and ii the sale of three investments in fha and gnma loans in the company s net cash provided by financing activities increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   due to i an increase in proceeds from borrowings under repurchase agreements  ii an increase in borrowings under bonds and mortgages payable  and iii the payment of special distributions in the company s primary source of cash is cash generated by its real estate investments 
cash generated by the multifamily residential properties is a function of the net cash flow of the underlying property 
the amount of cash received by the company from the real estate is a function of the net rental revenues generated by the properties 
net rental revenues from a multifamily apartment complex depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and on the level of operating expenses 
occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of  and demand for  apartments in the market areas in which a property is located 
this  in turn  is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions  the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single family mortgage loans 
in addition  factors such as government regulation such as zoning laws  inflation  real estate and other taxes  labor problems and natural disasters can affect the econo mic operations of a property 
the company s primary uses of cash are i the payment of debt service on the company s bonds and mortgages payable  ii the payment of distributions to unit holders  iii the payment of operating expenses  and iv the acquisition of additional real estate investments 
at december   the company s bonds and mortgages payable have an aggregate principal balance outstanding of approximately million 
these debt obligations consist of three bonds payable having an aggregate principal balance of approximately million 
these bonds require monthly interest payments and bear interest at a short term variable rate 
the variable interest rate paid on the bonds payable averaged approximately for the year ended december  these debt obligations also include three mortgages payable having an aggregate principal balance of approximately million 
these mortgages require monthly payments of principal and interest and have a weighted average fixed interest rate of at december  each debt obligation is secured by a first mortgage or deed of trust on one of the company s multifamily properties 
principal and interest payments are made solely from the net cash flow or net sales proceeds of the respective property 
distributions to unit holders are determined by and may increase or decrease at the determination of the general partner 
the general partner determines the amount of distributions based upon the historical and projected financial results of the company 
future distributions to unit holders will substantially depend upon the amount of net cash generated by the company s multifamily properties  its investments in corporate equity securities  and its undistributed cash 
the following table sets forth information regarding cash distributions paid to unit holders during the years shown 
imagegif 
per bac of the predecessor for years prior to the date of the merger 
in addition  in the company also made special distributions to note holders in conjunction with the settlement and merger 
the special distributions to note holders in january and april were and per note  respectively 
the company s strategy includes the acquisition of additional multifamily properties as well as debt and equity securities of entities engaged in similar activities 
the acquisition of multifamily properties and other investments will be funded from i borrowing against or net proceeds from the sale of the existing properties  ii borrowing against or sale of the gnma certificates  iii borrowing against the additional properties acquired by the company  and iv available cash 
the company may also use additional sources of financing  both debt and equity  to further its business objectives and investment strategies 
the company believes that cash provided by its real estate investments and investment income from its gnmas and other investments  supplemented  if necessary  by cash on hand  will be adequate to meet its projected short term and long term liquidity requirements

the company must also record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation

inflation substantially all leases at the company s properties are for a term of one year of less  which may enable it to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases in times of rising prices

forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements that reflect management s current beliefs and estimates of future economic circumstances  industry conditions  and the company s performance and financial results 
all statements  trend analysis and other information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations of the company and the real estate investments it has made including  but not limited to  the information contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations constitute forward looking statements 
unit holders and others should understand that these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  and a number of factors could affect the future results of the company and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements contained herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long and short term borrowings used to fund expansion of the company s real estate portfolio and its variable rate notes payable issued in connection with the merger 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the company s control 
the potential for significant volatility in the interest rate markets was especially displayed during  when the federal reserve board decreased the federal funds rate eleven times 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate caps  in order to mitigate its interest rate risk 
the company does not enter into derivative instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   approximately of the company s borrowings consisted of fixed rate financing 
the remaining consisted of variable rate financing 
variations in interest rates affect the company s cost of borrowing on its variable rate financing 
the interest rates payable by the company on these obligations increase or decrease with certain index interest rates 
if the company s borrowing costs increase  the amount of cash available for distribution to unit holders will decrease 
had the average index rates increased or decreased by basis points during the year ended december   interest expense on the company s variable rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately  respectively 
the following tables provide information at december  regarding the company s financial instruments sensitive to interest rate risk 
imagegif 
the aggregate fair value of the company s borrowings at december  was  as the above tables incorporate only those positions or exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
the company s ultimate economic impact with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s risk mitigating strategies at that time and interest rates
