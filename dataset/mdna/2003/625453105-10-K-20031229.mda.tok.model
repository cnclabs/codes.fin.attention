item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously and materially harmed  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
we face legal and regulatory uncertainties that threaten our ability to conduct our business and to effectively compete in the class ii market  increase our cost of doing business and divert substantial management time away from our operations 
historically  we have derived most of our revenue from class ii gaming activities conducted on native american lands 
these activities are subject to federal regulation under the johnson act  igra  the rules and regulations adopted by both the nigc and the separate gaming commissions established by each native american tribe to regulate gaming 
these gaming activities are also subject to regulation by state and local authorities  to the extent such gaming activities constitute  or are perceived to constitute  class iii gaming 
class iii is illegal in most states and may only be conducted by a tribe pursuant to a compact between a tribe and the state in which the tribe is located 
the johnson act broadly defines gambling devices to include any machine or mechanical device designed and manufactured primarily for use in connection with gambling  and that  when operated  delivers money or other property to a player as the result of the application of an element of chance 
a government agency or court that literally applied this definition and did not give effect to subsequent congressional legislation  or certain regulatory interpretations or judicial decisions could determine that the manufacture and use of our electronic player stations  and perhaps  other key components of our class ii gaming systems that rely to some extent upon electronic equipment to run a game  are illegal 
our tribal customers could be subject to significant fines and penalties if it is ultimately determined they are offering an illegal game  and an adverse regulatory or judicial determination regarding the legal status of our products could have material adverse consequences for our business  operating results and prospects 
the market for electronic class ii player stations and systems  from which we derive the substantial majority of our revenue  is subject to continuing ambiguity due to the difficulty of reconciling the johnson act s broad definition of gambling devices with the provisions of igra that expressly make legal the play of bingo and the use by tribes of electronic  computer  or other technological aids in the play of bingo 
issues surrounding the classification of our games as class ii games that may generally be offered by our tribal customers without a state compact  or class iii games that can only be offered by the tribes pursuant to such a compact  have in the past affected  and continue to affect  our business 
government enforcement or regulatory action or judicial decisions  or the prospects or rumors thereof  have in the past and will continue to effect our business  operating results and prospects 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past and may in the future be subject to significant fluctuations based upon market perceptions of the legal status of our products 
we also face risks from a lack of regulatory or judicial enforcement action 
in particular  our competitors may offer games that do not comply with published regulatory restrictions on class ii games  and thereby offer faster play than  or features not available in  our products 
to the extent the tribes are permitted to offer these games rather than ours  our market share  revenue and operating results may suffer 
in addition to federal regulation  all native american tribes are required by igra to adopt ordinances to regulate gaming as a condition of their right to conduct gaming on native american lands 
these ordinances often include the establishment of tribal gaming commissions that make their own judgment about whether an activity is class ii or class iii gaming 
it is our policy not to introduce a new game in a customer s gaming facility unless the tribe s gaming commission has made its own independent determination that the game is class ii gaming 
adverse regulatory decisions by tribal gaming commissions could adversely affect our business 
it is possible that new laws and regulations relating to our business may be enacted  and that existing laws and regulations could be amended or reinterpreted in a manner adverse to our business 
any regulatory change could materially and adversely affect the installation and use of existing and additional player stations  games and systems  and our ability to generate revenues from some or all of our class ii games 
in addition to the risks described above  regulatory uncertainty increases our cost of doing business 
we dedicate significant time and incur significant expense on new game development without any assurance that the nigc  the doj or other federal  state and local agencies or native american gaming commissions will agree that our games meet applicable regulatory requirements 
we also devote significant time and expense to dealing with federal  state and native american agencies having jurisdiction over native american gaming  and in complying with the various regulatory regimes that govern our business 
in addition  we are constantly monitoring new and proposed laws and regulations  or changes to such laws and regulations  and in assessing the possible impact upon us  our customers and our markets 
the us department of justice has recently sought review by the us supreme court of two us circuit court cases involving issues that fundamentally involve the legality of the substantial majority of our products 
on november   the doj filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court seeking review of two us circuit court cases that examined whether the johnson act prohibits native american tribes from offering certain types of electronic gaming devices 
in the petitions  the doj asserts that the johnson act prohibits native american tribes from operating certain electronic gambling devices without a compact with the appropriate state 
we are not a party to these actions  and we will likely have only limited information about the proceedings at the supreme court prior to their completion 
we cannot predict whether the supreme court will grant certiorari in these cases or  if certiorari is granted  how the supreme court will rule 
although our machines are not the subject of either lawsuit  the doj s arguments and reasoning would appear to encompass the machines we offer for the class ii market 
as a result  if the us supreme court were to grant certiorari and adopt the arguments advanced by the doj  the play of most of the our current products without a compact would likely be prohibited by the johnson act 
this result would almost certainly have a significant  material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
alternatively  a decision by the supreme court that rejected the doj s arguments and instead affirmed the right of the tribes to offer games and player stations such as those manufactured and sold by us as legal electronic aids to bingo for the class ii market could remove significant legal uncertainty in our principal market 
a favorable result could form the basis for expansion of class ii market opportunities and further innovation in the class ii market 
however  it could also result in increased competition from vendors in the class iii market who we believe have avoided entry into the class ii market due to the legal uncertainties described above 
the doj proceedings currently before the supreme court may affect our business prior to their resolution 
in particular  it is possible that the continued uncertainty in the class ii gaming market may deter or delay the entrance of new competitors into our markets 
conversely  our tribal customers may face increased pressure to seek a compact with the states in which they operate 
in the event one or more of our tribal customers entered into a state compact enabling the tribe to offer class iii games  demand for our class ii games could decline precipitously 
finally  speculation as to the outcome of these matters may lead to increased volatility or a general decline in the price of our common stock 
see risk factors if states enter into compacts with our existing class ii customers to allow class iii gaming  our results of operations could be materially harmed 
our future performance will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new games and enhancements to existing games that are widely accepted and played 
our revenue growth has been driven primarily by technological innovations to our gaming systems  and the increased size and use of our installed base of player stations 
our new generation gaming system has allowed us to produce games that not only play faster than our legacy games  but also provide enhanced entertainment to end users through improved graphics and sounds 
this  in turn  has enabled us to generate increased revenues for us and for our customers 
in january  we introduced megananza  our first game based on the new generation system 
in june  we introduced reel time bingo  a high speed  standard sequence bingo game  as a substitute for megananza 
as of october   we had converted all of our megananza games to some version of reel time bingo  both in response to the settlement agreement reached between us and the nigc  and to take advantage of improved technologies 
in november  we introduced and began deploying our gen gaming system  which will enable us to produce games with bonus rounds and wide area progressives  provide more end user enjoyment and also provide better networking capabilities among gaming systems 
our future performance will depend primarily on our ability to successfully and cost effectively develop and introduce new and enhanced games that will be widely accepted both by our tribal customers and their end users 
we believe our business requires us to continually offer games and technology that offer faster and more entertaining play than those offered by our competitors 
however  consumer preferences can be difficult to predict  and we may offer new games or technologies that do not achieve market acceptance 
in addition  we may experience delays in game development in the future  or we may not be successful in developing  introducing and marketing new games or game enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
furthermore  our new games may be subject to challenge by the nigc  the doj  or some other regulatory or law enforcement agency based on igra  the johnson act or some other regulatory mandate 
if we are unable  for technological  marketing or other reasons  to develop and introduce new games or enhancements of existing products in a timely manner in response to changing regulatory  legal or market conditions or customer requirements  or if new products or new versions of existing products do not achieve market acceptance  or if uneven nigc enforcement policies cause us to continue facing competition from bonanza bingo style games or other non class ii games offered by some competitors in the class ii market  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we are dependent upon a few customers who are based in oklahoma 
for the year ended september   two tribes in oklahoma accounted for approximately and of our net gaming revenues 
approximately of our net revenues from the same fiscal year were from native american tribes located in oklahoma 
the significant concentration of our customers in oklahoma means that local economic changes may adversely affect our customers  and therefore our business  disproportionately to changes in national economic conditions  including more sudden adverse economic declines or slower economic recovery from prior declines 
the loss of any of our oklahoma tribes as customers would have a material and adverse effect upon our financial condition and results of operations 
if states enter into compacts with our existing class ii customers to allow class iii gaming  our results of operations could be materially harmed 
the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from the placement of class ii gaming systems and player stations with tribal customers who are not parties to any state compact that would permit them to offer class iii games 
we do not currently generate a material amount of revenue from our class iii operations 
if any of our class ii tribal customers were to enter compacts with the states in which they operate allowing them to offer class iii games  we believe the number of game machine placements by us in those customers facilities would decline significantly and our operating results would be materially adversely affected 
these adverse affects would be particularly acute in a state such as oklahoma  where we have a concentration of customers  and where there have been numerous recent attempts to establish compacts 
we believe the establishment of a state compact depends on a number of political  social and economic factors which are inherently difficult to ascertain 
accordingly  although we attempt to monitor closely state legislative developments that could affect our business  we may not be able to timely predict when  or if a compact could be entered into by one or more of our tribal customers 
moreover  our business requires that we provide support for the economic interests of our tribal customers and we may therefore be restricted from taking political action or positions in opposition to the adoption of a compact 
we are seeking to expand our business by loaning money to new and existing customers to develop gaming facilities  and we are jointly developing or expanding gaming and related facilities with some of these customers 
we have limited experience with these activities and may not realize a satisfactory return  if any  on our investment  and we could lose some or all of our investment 
to date we have entered into eight development agreements to jointly develop and provide financing to construct tribal gaming facilities  one of which was completed in july under our development agreements  we secure a long term revenue share percentage and a guaranteed percentage of the tribal gaming facilities available floor space in exchange for development and construction funding 
in connection with these advances  we could face liquidity pressure or a complete loss of our investment if a tribe does not timely pay any amounts owed to us from such funding 
in addition  future nigc decisions could affect our ability to place our games with tribes  including the lytton rancheria tribe described below 
in october  we provided a bridge loan to the lytton rancheria of california  or lytton rancheria  a federally recognized native american tribe  which the tribe used to facilitate the transfer of land in san pablo  california to the united states in trust for lytton rancheria 
the bridge loan plus interest at prime plus will be repaid in accordance with the loan terms based upon certain triggering events  the tribe s ability to secure alternative funding or upon maturity in december our loan to the lytton rancheria tribe is different from our development agreements in that there is no assurance that the lytton rancheria tribe will either develop a tribal gaming facility or enter into an equipment leasing agreement with us if they do pursue gaming opportunities on the acquired land 
the loan is secured by certain of the tribe s personal property  as well as the net cash flow from the existing card room that is currently in operation at the acquired site 
we may continue to seek to enter into strategic relationships and provide financing and development services for new or expanded gaming and related facilities for our customers 
however  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any strategic relationship or financing 
in connection with one or more of those transactions  we may issue additional equity securities which would dilute existing stockholders  extend secured and unsecured credit which may not be repaid  incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay  and incur contingent liabilities 
we have limited experience in these types of activities 
our development effort or financing activities may result in unforeseen operating difficulties  financial risks or required expenditures that could adversely affect our liquidity 
it may also divert the time and attention of our management that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
as a result of providing financing or development services to our customers  we may not realize a satisfactory return  if any  on our investment  and we could lose some or all of our investment 
we believe diversification from native american gaming activities is critical to our growth strategy 
our expansion into non native american gaming activities will present new challenges and risks that could adversely affect our business or results of operations 
our growth strategy includes selling our games and technology into segments of the gaming industry other than native american gaming  principally the charity bingo market and new jurisdictions authorizing vlts 
in april  we finalized and executed a contract with the new york lottery to provide the central system for video lottery games to be operated at new york state racinos 
these and other non native american gaming opportunities are not currently subject to a nationwide regulatory system such as the one created by igra to regulate native american gaming  so regulation is on a state by state basis 
in addition  federal laws relating to gaming  such as the johnson act  which regulates slot machines and similar gambling devices  would also apply to new video lottery jurisdictions  absent authorized state law exemptions 
if we were to expand into these new markets  we would expect to encounter legal and regulatory uncertainties similar to those we face in our native american gaming business 
successful growth in accordance with this strategy may require us to make certain changes to our games to ensure that they comply with applicable regulatory regimes  and may require us to obtain additional licenses 
importantly  in certain jurisdictions and for certain venues  our ability to enter these markets will depend on effecting changes to existing laws and regulatory regimes 
the ability to effect these changes is subject to a great degree of uncertainty and may never be achieved 
we may not be successful in entering into other segments of the gaming industry 
generally  our selling of games and technology into new market segments involves a number of uncertainties  including whether our resources and expertise will enable us to effectively operate and grow in such new markets  whether our internal processes and controls continue to function effectively within these new segments  whether we have enough experience to accurately predict revenues and expenses in these new segments  and whether the diversion of management attention and resources from our traditional business caused by entering such segments will have harmful effects on our traditional business 
if we are unable to effectively develop and operate within these segments  then entering into these new segments could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
moreover  if we are unsuccessful in our attempt to diversify to new lines of business  or if a specific project such as the new york lottery racino project generates significantly less revenue than anticipated  our ability to grow and diversify our revenue streams may be impaired 
we compete for customers and end users with other vendors of class ii and class iii games 
we also compete for end users with other forms of entertainment 
we compete with other class ii vendors for customers  primarily on the basis of the amount of profit our gaming products generate for our customers in relation to other vendors gaming products 
we believe that the most important factor influencing our customers product selection is the appeal of those products to end users 
this appeal has a direct effect on the volume of play by end users  and drives the amount of revenues generated for and by our customers 
our ability to remain competitive depends primarily on our ability to continuously develop new game themes and systems that appeal to end users  and to introduce those game themes and systems in a timely manner see risk factors our future performance will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new games and enhancements to existing games that are widely accepted and played 
we may not be able to continue to develop and introduce appealing new game themes and systems that meet the emerging requirements of class ii gaming in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  others may independently develop games similar to our class ii games  and competitors may introduce non class ii games that unfairly compete in the class ii market due to uneven regulatory enforcement policies 
we believe continued developments in the class ii market that alleviate or clarify the legal and regulatory uncertainties of that market will result in increased competition in the interactive electronic class ii gaming market  including the entrance of new competitors with significant gaming experience and financial resources 
specifically  three of the largest manufacturers of gaming equipment have expressed an interest in the class ii market 
we believe the increased competition will intensify pressure on our pricing model 
in the future  gaming providers will compete on the basis of price as well as the entertainment value and technological superiority of their products 
while we will continue to compete by regularly introducing new and faster games  with technological enhancements that we believe will appeal to end users  we believe that the net revenue retained by our customers from their installed base of player stations will become a more significant factor  one that may require us to change the terms of our participation arrangements with customers to remain competitive 
consequently  we believe that a simple business model based upon a relationship between the average hold per player station per day and the installed base of player stations will become less relevant in predicting our performance  as the totality and the mix of our participation arrangements with customers become less standardized and more complex 
given the limitations placed on class ii gaming  we may not be able to successfully compete in gaming jurisdictions and facilities where slot machines  table games and other forms of class iii gaming are permitted 
furthermore  increases in the popularity of  and competition from  an expansion of class iii gaming or internet and other account wagering gaming services  which allow end users to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and to play traditional casino games from home  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our business requires us to obtain and maintain various licenses  permits and approvals from state governments and other entities that regulate our business 
we have obtained all state licenses  lottery board licenses  native american gaming commission licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our gaming activities 
these include a license from the state of washington to sell class iii video lottery systems  licenses from the lottery boards of the states of texas  louisiana and mississippi  and the district of columbia  and licenses from all applicable native american gaming commissions 
we may require new licenses  permits and approvals in the future  and such licenses  permits or approvals may not be granted to us 
the suspension  revocation  non renewal or limitation of any of our licenses would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights  or avoiding claims that we are infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others 
we rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  license agreements and employee nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights and technology  but these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection 
we rely to a greater extent upon proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to maintain our competitive position 
insofar as we rely on trade secrets  unpatented know how and innovation  others may be able to independently develop similar technology or our secrecy could be breached 
the issuance of a patent to us does not necessarily mean that our technology does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
as the class ii market grows and we enter into new markets by leveraging our existing technology  it becomes more and more likely that we will become subject to infringement claims from other parties 
problems with patents or other rights could increase the cost of our products  or delay or preclude new product development and commercialization 
if infringement claims against us are valid  we may seek licenses that might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
litigation would be costly and time consuming  but may become necessary to protect our proprietary rights or to defend against infringement claims 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in the defense of any claims relating to the proprietary rights of others or in asserting claims against others 
we rely on software licensed from third parties and technology provided by third party vendors  the loss of which could increase our costs and delay deployment of our gaming systems and player stations 
we also rely on technology provided by third party vendors which  if disrupted  could suspend play on some of our player stations 
we integrate various third party software products as components of our software 
our business would be disrupted if this software  or functional equivalents of this software  were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms 
in either case  we would be required to either redesign our software to function with alternate third party software or develop these components ourselves  which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in our deployment or our gaming systems and player stations 
furthermore  we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future software offerings 
we also rely on the technology of third party vendors  such as telecommunication providers  to operate our nationwide  broadband telecommunications network 
a serious or sustained disruption of the provision of these services could result in some of our player stations being non operational for the duration of the disruption  which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from those player stations 
we do not rely upon the term of our customer contracts to retain the business of our customers 
our contracts with our customers are on a year to year or multi year basis 
except for customers with whom we have entered into development agreements  we do not rely upon the stated term of our customer contracts to retain the business of our customers  as often non contractual considerations unique to doing business in the native american market override strict adherence to contractual provisions 
we rely instead upon providing competitively superior player stations  games and systems to give our customers the incentive to continue doing business with us 
at any point in time  a significant portion of our business is subject to non renewal  and  if not renewed  would materially and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
changes in regulation or regulatory interpretations could require us to modify the terms of our contracts with customers 
the nigc has considered the provisions of the agreements under which we provide our class ii games  equipment and services  and has determined that these agreements are service agreements and are not management contracts 
management contracts are subject to additional regulatory requirements and oversight  including pre approval by the nigc that could result in delays in providing our products and services to customers and divert customers to our competitors 
our contracts could be subject to further review at any time 
any further review of these agreements by the nigc could require substantial modification to our agreements or result in their redesignation as management contracts  either of which could materially and adversely affect the terms on which we conduct our business 
if our key personnel leave us  our business will be materially adversely affected 
we depend on the continued performance of the members of our senior management team and our technology team 
if we were to lose the services of any of our senior officers  directors or any member of our technology team  and could not find suitable replacements for such persons in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
enforcement of remedies or contracts against native american tribes could be difficult 
governing and native american law 
federally recognized native american tribes are independent governments  subordinate to the united states  with sovereign powers  except as those powers may have been limited by treaty or by the united states congress 
native american power to enact their own laws to regulate gaming is an exercise of native american sovereignty  as recognized by igra 
native american tribes maintain their own governmental systems and often their own judicial systems 
native american tribes have the right to tax persons and enterprises conducting business on native american lands  and also have the right to require licenses and to impose other forms of regulation and regulatory fees on persons and businesses operating on their lands 
native american tribes  as sovereign nations  are generally subject only to federal regulation 
although congress may regulate native american tribes  states do not have the authority to regulate native american tribes unless such authority has been specifically granted by congress 
in the absence of a specific grant of authority by congress  states may regulate activities taking place on native american lands only if the tribe has a specific agreement or compact with the state 
in the absence of a conflicting federal or properly authorized state law  native american law governs 
our contracts with native american customers provide that the law of the state in which a tribe is located will be the governing law of those contracts 
however  these choice of law clauses may not be enforceable 
sovereign immunity  applicable courts 
native american tribes generally enjoy sovereign immunity from suit similar to that of the individual states and the united states 
in order to sue a native american tribe or an agency or instrumentality of a native american tribe  the tribe must have effectively waived its sovereign immunity with respect to the matter in dispute 
our contracts with native american customers include a limited waiver of each tribe s sovereign immunity and generally provide that any dispute regarding interpretation  performance or enforcement shall be submitted to  and resolved by  arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association  and that any award  determination  order or relief resulting from such arbitration is binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction 
in the event that such waiver of sovereign immunity is held to be ineffective  we could be precluded from judicially enforcing any rights or remedies against a tribe 
these rights and remedies include  but are not limited to  our right to enter native american lands to retrieve our property in the event of a breach of contract by the tribe party to that contract 
if a native american tribe has effectively waived its sovereign immunity  there exists an issue as to the forum in which a lawsuit can be brought against the tribe 
federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and generally do not have jurisdiction to hear civil cases relating to native americans 
in addition  contractual provisions that purport to grant jurisdiction to a federal court are not effective 
federal courts may have jurisdiction if a federal question is raised by the suit  which is unlikely in a typical contract dispute 
diversity of citizenship  another common basis for federal court jurisdiction  is not generally present in a suit against a tribe  because a native american tribe is not considered a citizen of any state 
accordingly  in most commercial disputes with tribes  the jurisdiction of the federal courts may be difficult or impossible to obtain 
we may be unable to enforce any arbitration decision effectively 
we may incur prize payouts in excess of game revenues 
certain of our contracts with our native american customers relating to our legacy system games provide that our customers receive  on a daily basis  an agreed percentage of gross gaming revenues based upon an assumed level of prize payouts  rather than the actual level of prize payouts 
this can result in us paying our customers amounts greater than our customers percentage share of the actual hold per day 
in addition  because the prizes awarded in our games are based upon assumptions as to the number of players in each game and statistical assumptions as to the frequency of winners  we may experience on any day  or over short periods of time  a game deficit where the total aggregate amount of prizes paid exceeds aggregate game revenues 
if we have to make any excess payments to customers or experience a game deficit over any statistically relevant period of time  we are contractually entitled to adjust the rates of prize payout to end users in order to recover any deficit 
in the future  we may miscalculate our statistical assumptions or  for other reasons  we may experience abnormally high rates of jackpot prize wins which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow on a temporary or long term basis and which could materially and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
any disruption in our network or telecommunications services  or adverse weather conditions in the areas in which we operate could affect our ability to operate our games  which would result in reduced revenues and customer down time 
our network is susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  break ins  cyberattacks and similar events 
we have multiple site back up for our services in the event of any such occurrence 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses and break ins  similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems in any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
adverse weather conditions  particularly flooding  tornadoes  heavy snowfall and other extreme weather conditions often deter our end users from traveling or make it difficult for them to frequent the sites where our games are installed 
if any of the those sites were to experience prolonged adverse weather conditions  or if the sites in oklahoma where a significant number of our games are installed were to simultaneously experience adverse weather conditions  our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business 
the demand for entertainment and leisure activities tends to be highly sensitive to consumers disposable incomes  and thus a decline in general economic conditions may lead to our end users having less discretionary income with which to wager 
this could cause a reduction in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
item properties we do not own any real property 
as of september   we lease the following properties square feet monthly rent expiration date austin  texas corporate offices   july assembly facilities   july tulsa  oklahoma operations and sales offices   february warehouse   august dallas  texas computer programming offices   february kent  washington warehouse   july the aggregate annual rentals under these operating leases are approximately million 
we believe that these leases will be renewed as they expire  or that alternative properties can be leased on acceptable terms 
during july  management initiated a plan to relocate our corporate offices in austin  texas as a result of our continued growth and planned expansion 
not included in the above schedule is our former corporate office lease  which continues through july  with a monthly rent of  item litigation first american decision 
we were a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the federal court for the western district of oklahoma  alleging that we had tortiously interfered with a contract between the plaintiff and a native american tribe that granted the plaintiff the exclusive right to provide gaming machines to the tribe 
in july  the plaintiff stated its claim for damages in an amount ranging between million and million 
on september   a jury rendered a verdict in our favor on all counts in the complaint 
the plaintiff has filed an appeal with the tenth circuit court of appeals 
we are not able to make any prediction on the outcome of this appeal given the inherent uncertainties in any litigation 
megananza litigation and related nigc settlement proceedings 
on april   we received an advisory opinion from the deputy general counsel of the nigc  stating that megananza and its related family of games were class iii games as defined by igra 
on april   we filed a lawsuit against the nigc in the united states district court for the northern district of oklahoma  seeking a judicial declaration that our megananza family of games are class ii games 
on june   the nigc  represented by and acting through the doj  filed a motion to dismiss the case  claiming the court lacked jurisdiction on various procedural grounds 
after the nigc commissioner issued a notice of violation  or nov  to our largest customer on june   the court granted us a motion seeking the issuance of a temporary restraining order against the nigc from taking any enforcement actions against any of our customers for playing megananza 
notwithstanding the existence of the temporary restraining order against the nigc  as a result of the issuance of the nov  our largest megananza customer and certain other customers discontinued playing megananza  and requested that we install reel time bingo in place of existing megananza units 
on september   the court granted the motion by the doj to dismiss our action for lack of jurisdiction by the court  but did not address our substantive claim that megananza was a legal class ii game 
as a consequence of the dismissal  the temporary restraining order was dissolved  and the nigc was no longer prohibited from issuing additional novs or from taking further enforcement actions 
we appealed the granting of the motion to dismiss to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
prior to the tenth circuit s taking any action on our appeal  we entered into a settlement agreement with the nigc that established a fast track process for the nigc to consider and issue its opinion on the classification of a version of reel time bingo 
in return for the fast track process  we immediately dismissed with prejudice our pending appeal before the tenth circuit 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  we began and maintained an ongoing dialogue with nigc  which resulted in us making several changes that are reflected in the final version of reel time bingo version a 
the principal changes are as follows for game winners  reel time bingo version a requires three touches or daubs rather than the two touches in earlier versions  for non winners  reel time bingo version a requires three touches as opposed to either one or two touches  depending on how a tribe had configured earlier versions of the game  and reel time bingo version a requires all players to remain in a game until it is confirmed that an apparent winner of the game ending pattern has claimed the prize 
in reel time bingo versions and all players not achieving the game ending prize were permitted to move on to another game before the apparent winner had daubed to claim the prize 
the settlement agreement also stipulates that once the nigc opinion is issued  the nigc is required to notify all class ii tribes of its position on electronic bonanza bingo style games  such as megananza 
an advisory opinion was issued by the nigc to us on september   stating that version a of our reel time bingo game was a legal class ii bingo game 
however  this opinion is not binding on the doj 
see item business governmental regulation  and risk factors the us department of justice has recently sought review by the us supreme court of two us circuit court cases involving issues that fundamentally involve the legality of the substantial majority of our products 
as of october   we had converted all our megananza games to some version of reel time bingo 
other litigation 
in addition to the threat of litigation relating to the class ii or class iii status of our games and equipment  we are the subject of various pending and threatened claims arising out of the ordinary course of business 
we believe that any liability resulting from these various other claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
other 
existing federal and state regulations may also impose civil and criminal sanctions for various activities prohibited in connection with gaming operations  including false statements on applications and failure or refusal to obtain necessary licenses described in the regulations

we design and develop hardware  software networks and content that provide our customers with a comprehensive gaming system 
historically  we have focused our efforts on class ii gaming systems and class iii video lottery systems used primarily by native american tribes 
we have also contracted to supply the central operating system for the state of new york s video lottery system 
we derive the majority of our gaming revenues from the placement of class ii player stations under participation arrangements  and to a lesser degree from the placement of class iii video lottery terminals  or vlts  under lease purchase or participation arrangements  and the back office fees generated by class iii video lottery systems 
a significantly smaller portion of our revenues is generated from the sale of vlts and game licenses in the class iii market  except for a relatively few periods during which market conditions result in a temporary increase in the numbers of vlts sold during the period eg  the opening of a new casino  or a change in the law that allows existing casinos to increase the number of vlts permitted under prior law 
class ii market we derive our class ii gaming revenues primarily from participation arrangements with our customers 
under participation arrangements  we retain ownership of the player stations installed at our customers tribal gaming facilities  and receive revenue based on a percentage of the hold per day generated by each player station 
the network wide hold is reported by us as gaming revenue  and represents the total amount end users wager  less the total amount paid to end users for prizes 
the amounts retained by the halls for their share of the hold are reported in our results of operations as allotments to hall operators  and are deducted from our total revenues to arrive at our net revenues 
we believe that net revenue and our net revenue per player station per day are the most important factors for evaluating our performance in the class ii market 
net revenue per player station per day represents total gaming revenues less allotments to hall operators  divided by the average number of player stations and the number of days in the period 
our historical growth in revenue is a reflection of the increase in our installed base of player stations and the technological advances we have developed and implemented 
these advances have enabled us to dramatically increase the frequency and the number of games played on our system over any given period of time 
our gaming systems enable us to rapidly launch new games with moderate cost  which we believe provide end users with greater levels of entertainment 
we believe that this leads to a greater number of end users and end users receiving more perceived value from their entertainment dollar 
our new generation gaming system operates at a speed considerably faster than our legacy system  generally resulting in end users playing a greater number of games on our new generation system than they otherwise could have on our legacy gaming system in the same amount of time 
as a result of the faster speed of play and higher payout ratios  we believe that end users derive a higher level of satisfaction from playing our new generation games 
we believe that this enhanced satisfaction results in end users playing games for longer periods of time than they would have played on our legacy system  resulting in higher net revenue per player station on our new generation system 
in november  we introduced and began deploying our gen gaming system  which will enable us to produce games with bonus rounds and wide area progressives  provide more end user enjoyment and also provide better networking capabilities among gaming systems 
as the market grows  and if the rules and regulations governing class ii gaming are clarified by court decisions and by improved rule making procedures  we believe new competitors with significant gaming experience and financial resources will enter the class ii market 
we believe the increased competition will intensify pressure on our pricing model  with the result that gaming providers will compete on the basis of price as well as the entertainment value and technological superiority of their products 
while we will continue to compete by regularly introducing new and more entertaining games with technological enhancements that we believe will appeal to end users  we believe that the level of net revenue retained by our customers from their installed base of player stations will become a more significant competitive factor  one that may require us to change the terms of our participation arrangements with customers 
consequently  we believe that a simple business model based upon the average hold per player station per day will become less relevant in predicting our performance  as the totality and the mix of our participation arrangements with customers become less standardized and more complex 
since our inception  we produced megabingo  a live paper bingo game that originally featured a live bingo ball draw that was televised and transmitted to multiple bingo halls throughout the us megabingo enabled players in participating halls to compete with players in other halls in a single live bingo game to win a large jackpot prize 
since introducing our legacy and new generation gaming systems  we experienced a decline in the revenue generated by megabingo  as hall operators migrated to our class ii player stations  which many players found more entertaining 
as a result of the continued decline both in the number of participating halls and in the resulting revenue during the quarter ended december   we initiated a plan to discontinue the play of megabingo and held a championship game during april to conclude megabingo play 
for the year ended september   megabingo revenues were  in may  we introduced our class ii megamania game  the first in a series of high speed  interactive bingo games based on our legacy gaming system that are played on player stations linked with one another via nationwide  broadband telecommunications network 
in january  we introduced our megananza game  a new generation bonanza style bingo game  where the balls are drawn before the bingo cards are purchased 
megananza plays faster than our legacy games  and generates increased revenues for us and our customers 
in june   we introduced reel time bingo  a new generation based  high speed  standard sequence bingo game  in which the cards are purchased before the balls are drawn 
as of october  we had converted all of our megananza games to some version of reel time bingo both in response to our settlement agreement with the nigc  and to take advantage of improved technologies 
the conversion was accomplished relatively easily  as megananza and reel time bingo are both game engines that operate on our new generation gaming system  which  among other benefits  allows the conversion to be achieved by loading new software  either from our network operations center or at the customer s gaming facility 
for the year ended september   the net revenue per player station per day for reel time bingo was approximately  compared to approximately for megananza 
as of september   megananza player stations  representing of our total installed base of class ii player stations  remained in two facilities with higher holds than the historical network average for megananza 
the remaining megananza units were converted to reel time bingo in october on a casino to casino comparison  where megananza player stations have been wholly converted to reel time bingo  and prior to recent changes in the competitive environment  the reel time bingo units have generally performed equal to or better than the megananza units replaced  following a player familiarization period 
class iii market the majority of our class iii vlts have been sold to customers outright  for a one time purchase price  and are reported in our results of operations as player station and license sale and lease revenue 
certain game themes used by us in the class iii market have been licensed from third parties and are resold to customers along with our class iii vlts 
revenues from the sale of class iii vlts and the sale of player station licenses are recognized when the units are delivered to the customer  and the licensed games installed 
to a considerably lesser extent  we also enter into either participation arrangements or lease purchase arrangements for our class iii vlts similar to those used for our class ii player stations 
we also receive back office fees based on a share of the hold per day from both leased and sold vlts 
back office fees cover the service and maintenance costs for back office servers installed in each hall to run our class iii games  as well as the cost of related software updates 
for those vlts sold to our customers  the back office fees are considerably smaller than the revenue share we receive from class ii player stations being rented under participation agreements 
accordingly  we derive our class iii revenues to a greater extent from vlt sales  compared to the level of gaming revenues derived from participation arrangements in the class ii market 
in june  we installed our first class iii vlts in the state of washington  which was the first state where class iii video lottery systems were permitted by native american state compact 
during  we had significant sales of class iii vlts  as initial sales were made pursuant to newly adopted native american compacts with the state of washington which  by their terms  limited the number of installed class iii vlts permitted on native american land 
as new casinos are introduced into the washington market or existing casinos are expanded  and as the compact limitations on the number of installed vlts are eased  we have experienced brief periods during which there was a temporary increase in the number of vlts sold  thereby resulting in anomalies when comparing one period to another 
we believe similar occurrences may result in fluctuations in our sales of class iii vlts in the future 
during  we had an average of  class iii vlts in service  compared to  units during the same period of joint development agreements as we seek to continue the growth in our customer base and to expand our installed base of linked class ii player stations  a key element of our strategy has become entering into joint development agreements with various native american tribes to help fund new tribal gaming facilities 
pursuant to these agreements  we advance funds to the tribes for the construction of new tribal gaming facilities or for the expansion of existing facilities 
these agreements provide for repayment by the customer of some or all of the amounts advanced 
amounts that are advanced in excess of those reimbursed by such tribes for real property and land improvements are allocated to an intangible asset and amortized over the life of the contract 
amounts advanced that relate to personal property owned by us and located at the tribal gaming facility are carried in our property and equipment and depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the life of the contract 
in return  we receive a percentage of the floor space and a fixed percentage of the hold per day from the player stations at the gaming facility 
to date  we have completed one facility under one such development agreement  for million  and have signed agreements for seven additional facilities in oklahoma for an aggregate outstanding commitment to advance approximately million 
we are in various stages of discussion with new and existing tribal customers to provide funding for similar development opportunities 
however  we may not be successful in entering into any additional agreements 
license agreements we have license agreements with wms gaming  inc  or wms  and bally gaming inc  or bally  to use certain trademarks  logos and graphics in connection with our class iii games 
we  in turn  resell these licenses to our customers in connection with the installation of our class iii vlts that use these licenses 
revenues from these license fees are reported in our results of operations under player station and license sale and lease revenue 
we also have a similar license agreement for the class ii market with bally  wms  and mikohn gaming corporation 
because we generally install our class ii player stations and games with our customers on a participation arrangement basis  thereby retaining ownership of the player stations  we do not resell licenses for use in the class ii market 
recent developments doj action 
on november   the doj filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the supreme court seeking review of two us circuit court cases that examined whether the johnson act prohibits native american tribes from offering certain types of electronic gaming devices 
specifically  the doj seeks review of united states of america v 
santee sioux tribe of nebraska  a federally recognized indian tribe  on petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit  and john d 
ashcroft  attorney general  et al  v 
seneca cayuga tribe of oklahoma  et al 
on petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
in the petitions  the doj asserts that the johnson act prohibits native american tribes from operating certain electronic gambling devices without a compact with the appropriate state 
we are not a party to these actions  and we will likely have only limited information about the proceedings at the supreme court prior to their completion 
we cannot predict whether the supreme court will grant certiorari in these cases or  if certiorari is granted  how the supreme court will rule 
accordingly  we do not intend to speculate about the potential outcomes in these matters 
although our machines are not the subject of either lawsuit  the doj s arguments and reasoning would appear to encompass the machines we offer for the class ii market 
as a result  if the us supreme court were to grant certiorari and accept the arguments advanced by the doj  the play of most of our current products without a compact would likely be prohibited by the johnson act 
this result would almost certainly have a significant  material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
alternatively  a decision by the supreme court that rejected the doj s arguments and instead affirmed the right of the tribes to offer games and player stations such as those manufactured and sold by us as legal electronic aids to bingo for the class ii market could remove significant legal uncertainty in our principal market 
a favorable result could form the basis for expansion of market opportunities  and further innovation in the class ii market 
however  it could also result in increased competition from vendors in the class iii market who we believe have avoided entry into the class ii market due to the legal uncertainties described above 
the doj petitions currently before the supreme court may affect our business prior to their resolution 
in particular  it is possible that the continued uncertainty in the class ii gaming market may deter or delay the entrance of new competitors into our markets 
also  our tribal customers may face increased pressure to seek a compact with the states in which they operate 
in the event one or more of our tribal customers entered into a state compact enabling the tribe to offer class iii games  demand for our class ii games could decline precipitously 
finally  speculation as to the outcome of these matters may lead to increased volatility or a general decline in the price of our common stock 
however  it is difficult to predict whether these or other effects will actually occur or  should they occur  what impact they will have on our business 
we intend to continue to disclose any material effects we experience as a result of the actions of the doj or other regulatory developments 
lytton rancheria loan 
in october  we provided a bridge loan to the lytton rancheria of california  or lytton rancheria  a federally recognized native american tribe  which the tribe used to facilitate the transfer of land in san pablo  california to the united states in trust for lytton rancheria 
the bridge loan plus interest at prime plus will be repaid in accordance with the loan terms based upon certain triggering events  the tribe s ability to secure alternative funding or upon maturity in december our loan to the lytton rancheria tribe is different from our development agreements in that there is no assurance that the lytton rancheria tribe will either develop a tribal gaming facility or enter into an equipment leasing agreement with us if they do pursue gaming opportunities on the acquired land 
the loan is secured by certain of the tribe s personal property  as well as the net cash flow from the existing card room that is currently in operation at the acquired site
