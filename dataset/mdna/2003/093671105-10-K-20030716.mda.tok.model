item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the information called for by this item is contained in the company s annual report to security holders for the fiscal year ended april   under the heading management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  and is hereby incorporated by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk generally in the operations of its subsidiaries and the reporting of its consolidated financial results  the company is affected by changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and equity values 
the principal risks of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company and its subsidiaries are exposed  and which may be material  relate to interest rates on cash equivalents  available for sale securities  residual interests in securitizations  mortgage servicing rights msrs  mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments  investments in mortgage loans held for sale  debt and margin lending activities  retail trading volumes  other assets  commercial paper issuances  foreign exchange rates  generating translation gains and losses  and equity prices 
the company and its subsidiaries have market risk sensitive instruments entered into for non trading and trading purposes 
the company s broker dealer holds marketable fixed income securities for resale to retail clients 
non trading interest rates 
the company s rate sensitive assets and liabilities are managed at the subsidiary level 
the finance committee of the company s board of directors approves the company s policies and procedures utilized to manage the company s interest rate risk 
the company has established investment guidelines to help minimize the market risk exposure of its non residual available for sale securities portfolio 
these guidelines focus on managing liquidity  preservation of principal  and earnings  which are primarily affected by credit quality and movements in interest rates 

table of contents approximately of the company s cash equivalents ce and available for sale securities afs  which includes residual interests  are classified as short term  compared to last year 
the ce assets are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality  short term investments  including qualified money market funds taxable and tax exempt 
as of april  and april   the portfolio had a duration of less than years with an average credit quality of aaa 
with such a short maturity  the portfolio s market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes 
the company s residual interests in securitizations  the majority of afs  and msrs are subject to prepayment risk  because a mortgage borrower has the option to prepay a mortgage loan at any time 
prepayment risk tends to increase when interest rates fall due to the benefits of refinancing 
the expected income from these residual interests and msrs is sensitive to movements in interest rates due to this sensitivity to mortgage prepayments 
the prepayment risk is partially offset with the collection of prepayment penalties  a feature on the majority of originated loans 
in addition  prepayment penalties have the effect of reducing the borrowers propensity to prepay their mortgage during the penalty term 
residual interests are recorded based on discounted cash flow models utilizing prepayment  interest rate  credit losses and discount rate assumptions 
prepayment and loss assumptions are based on evaluation of the actual experience of the company s servicing portfolio or on market rates on new portfolios  taking into consideration the current and expected interest rate environment and its expected impact on future prepayment and default rates 
at april   the sensitivity of the current fair value of the residual interests to a adverse change in prepayment rates would lower the fair value of the residual interests by million  compared to million at april  mortgage servicing rights are recorded based on the present value of estimated future cash flows related to servicing loans utilizing market discount rates and anticipated prepayment speeds 
the prepayment speeds are estimated using the company s historical experience and third party market sources  where applicable 
at april   the sensitivity of the current fair value of msrs to a adverse change in prepayment rates would lower the fair value by million  compared to at april  residual assets bear the interest rate risk embedded within the securitization due to an initial fixed rate period on the loans versus the floating rate funding cost  and the on going basis risk between the indices of the floating rate assets and liabilities  offset somewhat by interest rate caps sometimes embedded within the securitization 
an adverse change in interest rates of would impact the fair value of residuals by million at april   compared to million at april  the company originates mortgage loans and sells most non prime loans the same day the loans are funded to trusts 
as a result of the whole loan sales to the trusts  the company removes the mortgage loans from its balance sheet  records the gain on sale  cash and a receivable which represents the ultimate expected outcome from the disposition of the loans by the trusts 
changes in interest rates and other market factors may result in ultimate disposition of the loans for amounts that vary from this expected outcome 
the trusts  as directed by the trustees  generally enter into forward loan sales commitments which reduce the variability in the expected outcome from ultimate disposition of the loans 
as a result  an adverse change in interest rates of would generally not expose the company to significant losses relating to changes in the fair value of the receivable from the trusts 
see note mortgage banking activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the company s annual report to security holders for the fiscal year ended april  for further sensitivity analysis of the other assumptions and detailed explanations of the cash flow models used 

table of contents the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments 
these commitments to fund mortgage loans consist of fixed and adjustable rate loans  which will be largely sold in the secondary market 
the company had commitments to fund mortgage loans of billion at april  and billion at april   as long as the borrower fulfills the conditions required in the loan commitment 
external market forces impact the probability of commitments being exercised  and therefore  total commitments outstanding do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the risk with some of these commitments to fund mortgage loans is that interest rates might rise between the time the customer locks in the interest rate on the loan and the time the loan is sold 
with the remaining commitments  where the borrower has not locked the interest rate on the loan  the same risks exist to the extent that interest rates rise and the company chooses to not raise the rate on the loan 
in some instances  the company will utilize hedge vehicles or forward loan sale commitments to reduce this interest rate risk 
it is the company s policy to utilize hedge vehicles only for the purpose of offsetting or reducing the risk of loss in earnings associated with a defined or quantified exposure 
they are purchased from certain broker dealer counterparties 
if the counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  the company may be exposed to default risk 
as the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty  the company s policy requires such transactions may be entered into only with counterparties rated a or better or an equivalent rating by recognized rating agencies 
as a matter of practice  the company has limited the counterparties to major banks and financial institutions meeting such standards 
all interest rate contracts conform to the standard international swaps and derivatives association  inc documentation 
an adverse change in interest rates of would generally not expose the company to significant losses related to its commitments  net of any gains or losses on associated hedge positions 
commercial paper is issued throughout the year primarily to fund seasonal working capital needs  dividend payments and purchases of treasury stock 
at april  and april   no commercial paper was outstanding 
for fiscal year  the average issuance term was days and average outstandings were million 
this compares with days and million for fiscal year the issuance term and average outstandings declined from the prior fiscal year due to the company s agreement to waive its rights to purchase participation interests in  and receive license fees related to  rals during the period january  through april  as commercial paper borrowings are seasonal  interest rate risk typically increases through the company s third fiscal quarter and declines to zero by fiscal year end 
see financial condition under the heading management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition in the company s annual report to security holders for the fiscal year ended april  at april  and april   there were no hedges outstanding related to long term debt 
the company s long term debt at april  and april  consisted primarily of fixed rate senior notes  therefore  a change in interest rates would have no impact on consolidated pretax earnings 
see note  long term debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the company s annual report to security holders for the fiscal year ended april  the company s broker dealer holds interest bearing receivables from customers  brokers  dealers and clearing organizations  which consist primarily of amounts due on margin transactions and are generally short term in nature 
the company s broker dealer funds these short term assets with short term variable rate liabilities from customers  brokers and dealers  including stock loan activity 
although there may be differences in the timing of the re pricing related to these assets and 
table of contents liabilities  the company believes it is not significantly exposed to interest rate risk in this area 
as a result  any change in interest rates would not materially impact the company s consolidated pretax earnings 
foreign exchange rates 
the operation of the company s subsidiaries in international markets provides exposure to volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the currencies involved are the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the british pound 
international tax operations constituted approximately of the company s fiscal year consolidated pretax income  compared to in fiscal as currency exchange rates change  translation of the financial results of international tax operations into us dollars does not presently materially affect  and has not historically materially affected  the consolidated financial results of the company  although such changes do affect the year to year comparability of the operating results of the international businesses 
the company translates revenues and expenses related to its international operations at the average of exchange rates in effect during the period 
the sensitivity analysis of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates compares the us dollar variance in using the actual exchange rates and using rates  which have been adversely adjusted by 
the company estimates a change in foreign exchange rates by itself would impact reported pretax income from continuing operations by approximately million 
such impact represents approximately of the pretax income of international tax operations for fiscal year and approximately 
of the company s pretax income for such year 
in fiscal  a change in exchange rates would have impacted fiscal pretax income by approximately 
million or of international tax operations pretax income and 
of the company s pretax income 
equity 
the company has exposure to the equity markets in several ways 
the largest exposures are through the company s deferred compensation plans  which have mismatches in asset and liability amounts and investment choices both fixed income and equity  and through equity investments in the captive insurance company 
at april   the impact of a market value change in the combined equity assets of the deferred compensation plans and the captive insurance company would be approximately million  assuming no offset for the liabilities  versus million at april  trading the company s fixed income trading portfolio is affected by changes in market rates prices 
the risk is the loss of income arising from adverse changes in the value of the trading portfolio 
the company s broker dealer holds the trading portfolio at quoted market prices and such portfolio represents 
of the company s total assets at april   compared to 
at april  the market value of the company s trading portfolio at fiscal year end was approximately million  compared to approximately million at fiscal year end 
the impact of a change in the market value of these investments for fiscal year would be approximately million  or about 
of consolidated pretax income 
the impact 
table of contents of such a change for fiscal year would be million  or about 
of consolidated pretax income 
with respect to its fixed income securities portfolio  the company manages its market price risk exposure by limiting concentration risk  maintaining minimum credit quality and limiting inventory to anticipated retail demand and current market conditions
