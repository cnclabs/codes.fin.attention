management continues to closely monitor awbc s credit quality and focus on identifying potential problem credits and any loss exposure in a timely manner 
industry concentration and related limits will continue to be subject to on going assessments

table of contents americanwest bancorporation in eastern washington  northern idaho and the pacific northwest in general as well as the continued internal growth of the loan portfolio 
provisions are made to reserve for known and inherent risk characteristics within the loan portfolio 
awbc and its subsidiaries regularly evaluate the level of provision and the allowance for loan losses for adequacy by considering such factors as current loan grades  historical loss rates  change in the nature of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  industry concentrations  delinquency trends  current economic factors and estimate impact of current economic conditions that may effect a borrower s ability to pay 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provision for loan loss 
in addition  the allowance for losses and loans and the provision for loan losses is also subject to regulatory supervision and examination 
noninterest income

income tax expense 
income tax expense increased in proportion to the increase in net income before taxes 
liquidity and capital resources management believes that awbc s cash flow will be sufficient to support its existing operations for the foreseeable future 
cash flows from operations contribute significantly to liquidity  as do proceeds from maturities of securities and increasing customer deposits 
if awbc needs additional liquidity  it would be required to borrow or issue additional capital stock 
awbc s ability to incur indebtedness is limited by government regulations and its ability to service borrowings is dependent upon the availability of dividends from the banks 
the payments of dividends by the banks are subject to limitations imposed by law and governmental regulations 
during awb received  in certificates of deposit through the use of qwickrate express data and their internet services 
the bank may borrow on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds 
bank borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity of repricing intervals of assets 
at december   awbc had approximately million of lines of credit available for liquidity purposes 
cash flows from operations also contribute significantly to liquidity as indicated in awbc s consolidated statement of cash flows  as well as proceeds from maturities of securities and increasing customer deposits 
awbc s total stockholders equity increased to  at december   from  at december  and  at december  at december   stockholders equity was of total assets  compared to at december  at december   awbc held cash and cash equivalent assets of million 
the capital levels of awbc and the banks exceed applicable regulatory well capitalized guidelines at december  
table of contents americanwest bancorporation effects of inflation and changing prices 
the primary impact of inflation on awbc s operations is increased asset yields  deposit costs and operating overhead 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
the effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets  and if significant  would require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than would otherwise be necessary

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management considers interest rate risk to be a market risk that could have a significant effect on the financial condition and results of operations of awbc 
awbc does not use derivatives including forward and futures contracts  options  and swaps to manage its market and interest rate risks 
all of awbc s transactions are denominated in us dollars 
approximately of awbc s loan portfolio has interest rates  which float with the banks reference interest rates 
fixed rate loans are generally made with a term of five years or less 
general economic conditions  regulatory policy and competition in the marketplace affect interest income and cost of funds 
the banks operating strategies focus on asset liability management

awbc follows an alm policy for controlling exposure to interest rate risk 
the alm policy is designed to maintain an appropriate balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to maximize interest rate spreads 
awbc monitors the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities with respect to changes in interest rates and maturities  and direct the allocation of their funds accordingly 
the strategy of awbc has been to maintain  to the extent possible  a balanced position between assets and liabilities  and to place emphasis on the sensitivity of its assets
