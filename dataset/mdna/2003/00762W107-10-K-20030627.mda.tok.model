item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we provide best practices research and analysis across the health care industry 
best practices research identifies and analyzes specific management initiatives  processes and strategies that have been determined to produce the best results in solving common business problems or challenges 
for a fixed  annual fee  members of each program have access to an integrated set of services  including best practices research studies  executive education seminars  customized research briefs and web based access to the program s content database and decision support tools 
our revenues grew in fiscal over fiscal  and grew in fiscal over fiscal we increased our contract value by at march  over march   and by over march  we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all membership agreements in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
memberships in each of our best practices research programs are renewable at the end of their one year membership contracts 
our remaining programs provide best practices installation support 
these month program memberships help participants accelerate the adoption of best practices profiled in our research studies  and are therefore not individually renewable 
renewable programs generated more than of our revenues in fiscal  with the balance of our revenues generated by programs providing installation support 
costs associated with a new program initially increase more rapidly than revenues following introduction of the program because revenues associated with the new program are recognized ratably over the membership year while costs are expensed as incurred 
because we offer a standardized set of services  however  our program cost structure is relatively fixed and the incremental cost to serve an additional member is low 
as a result  our operating margin has increased as we increased the number of members participating in our existing programs  partially offset by the costs associated with the introduction of additional new programs 
in fiscal  our income from operations was million  compared to million in fiscal our operating costs and expenses consist of cost of services  member relations and marketing  general and administrative expenses and depreciation 
cost of services represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services 
member relations and marketing expenses include the costs of acquiring new members and renewing existing members 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of human resources and recruiting  finance and accounting  management information systems  facilities management  new program development and other administrative functions 
as a private company  we entered into the following arrangements which were discontinued in connection with our initial public offering 
accordingly  we believe the effect of these items on our historical financial statements are not indicative of future results 
we entered into special equity based compensation arrangements with key employees 
these arrangements were predominantly the repurchase of stock options and a special bonus paid to optionholders in the absence of a public market for our stock 
since our initial public offering  we have not entered  and do not anticipate that in the future we will enter into any special compensation arrangements  although we incurred charges of  in fiscal with respect to arrangements entered into prior to our initial public offering 
we paid the affiliate company charge to dgb enterprises  inc  a corporation created by our former principal stockholder in to manage his various business interests  for strategic direction and oversight 
as of october   our newly constituted board of directors began to provide this strategic direction and oversight and  consequently  we no longer pay the affiliate company charge 
prior to our initial public offering  we were treated as an s corporation for federal income tax purposes 
as an s corporation  our taxable income or loss flowed through to  and was reportable by  our stockholders 
accordingly  we did not make any provision for federal income taxes in our financial statements for periods ending prior to the closing of our initial public offering 
in conjunction with our initial public offering  our s corporation status terminated and we became subject to federal income taxes at prevailing corporate rates 
the impact of this change resulted in a benefit for income taxes of million during the three months ended december  results of operations the following table shows statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended march  revenues costs and expenses cost of services excluding special compensation and stock option related expenses of  and member relations and marketing excluding special compensation and stock option related expenses of  and general and administrative excluding special compensation and stock option related expenses of  and depreciation and loss on disposal of fixed assets special compensation and stock option related expenses affiliate company charge total costs and expenses loss income from operations interest income loss income before benefit provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net loss income fiscal years ended march   and revenues 
total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and increased to million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to the introduction and expansion of new programs  cross selling existing programs to existing members  and  to a lesser degree  sales to new member organizations and price increases 
we offered twelve membership programs as of march   as of march   and as of march  our contract value increased from million at march  to million at march   and increased to million at march  we define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributed to all membership agreements in effect at a given point in time  without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement 
cost of services 
cost of services increased from million  or of revenues  in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  and increased to million  or of revenues  in fiscal costs associated with a new program initially increase more rapidly than revenues following introduction of the program because revenues associated with the new program are recognized ratably over the membership year while costs are expensed as incurred 
because we offer a standardized set of services  our program cost structure is relatively fixed and the incremental cost to serve an additional member is low 
consequently  while cost of services increased across fiscal and fiscal  it decreased as a percentage of revenues in both years 
member relations and marketing 
member relations and marketing expense increased from million or of revenues in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  and increased to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in member relations and marketing expense was primarily due to an increase in sales staff and related costs associated with the introduction of new programs  as well as an increase in member relations personnel and related costs to serve the expanding membership base 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased from million  or of revenues  in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal  and increased to million  or of revenues  in fiscal with the development of new programs and the expansion of several administrative functions 
the decrease as a percent of revenues in fiscal and fiscal reflects the leveraging of resources across our larger revenue base 
general and administrative expense includes approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  of net charges from dgb enterprises  inc for expenses related to management services  shared space and facilities and certain administrative functions 
we believe these charges approximate the expense which would have been incurred had we provided the equivalent services internally 
see note to our financial statements for a detailed description of the administrative services agreement with dgb enterprises  inc depreciation 
depreciation expense increased from million  or of revenues in fiscal  to million  or of revenues in fiscal  and decreased to million  or of revenues in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to increased capital expenditures in fiscal  which incurred a full year of depreciation expense in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to lower capital expenditures in fiscal and fiscal as compared to prior years 
special compensation and stock option related expenses 
special compensation and stock option related expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and decreased to million in fiscal since our initial public offering  we have not entered into  and we do not anticipate that we will enter in the future  any special compensation arrangements 
see note to our financial statements for a detailed description of these arrangements 
in fiscal  we recognized approximately  in compensation expense reflecting additional federal insurance corporation act fica taxes as a result of the taxable income that employees recognized upon the exercise of non qualified common stock options  primarily in conjunction with the registered public offering in november affiliate company charge 
affiliate company charge decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as of october   we no longer pay the affiliate company charge 
see note to our financial statements for more information regarding this charge 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities 
program memberships are generally payable by members at the beginning of the contract term 
the combination of revenue growth and advance payment of memberships typically results in operating activities generating net positive cash flows on an annual basis  excluding cash payments for special compensation arrangements and the funding of affiliate activities 
since completion of our initial public offering  cash payments for special compensation arrangements have had no material effect on operating cash flows and  beginning october   we have not paid an affiliate company charge 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at march  we expect that these funds and expected net positive cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital  financing activities and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash flows used in investing activities during fiscal were million  consisting of million of purchases of property and equipment  offset by million in proceeds from the sale of marketable securities 
net cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal were million  attributable to purchases of property and equipment 
we used net cash flows in investing activities in fiscal of million  consisting of purchases of marketable securities of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash flows from financing activities in fiscal were approximately million  consisting of cash contributions by our former principal stockholder 
in fiscal  we distributed million to our pre ipo stockholders  consisting of million of cash and million of offering costs and other cash distributions we paid in conjunction with our initial public offering 
we generated million in cash from financing activities in fiscal  of which million was from the receipt of cash for the exercise of stock options in conjunction with the sale of our common stock by our employees in a registered public offering in november also in fiscal  we received approximately  in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we lease our office facilities  and the lease expires in april we have recently signed a nonbinding letter of intent to lease approximately  square feet of new office space 
we expect to move our headquarters into this new location upon the termination of our current lease 
the terms of the new lease are expected to contain provisions for rental escalation and we expect to be required to pay our portion of executory costs such as taxes and insurance 
future minimum obligations under our current lease  including executory costs  are million 
the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at march  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
these arrangements are more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts below do not include possible future obligations under the nonbinding letter of intent to lease new office space 
payments due by period in thousands total years non cancelable operating leases facilities services contract total at march  and  we have no off balance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for purposes of facilitating off balance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
exercise of certain options certain options granted to optionholders under our and stock based incentive compensation plans to purchase  shares of our common stock  were exercised to acquire shares sold in a registered public offering in november upon the exercise of these options  we received approximately million in cash in payment of option exercise prices 
we recognized approximately  in compensation expense reflecting additional federal insurance corporation act taxes as a result of the taxable income that employees recognized upon the exercise of non qualified common stock options  primarily in conjunction with the registered public offering in november we also incurred additional compensation expense for tax reporting purposes  but not for financial reporting purposes  that increased our deferred tax asset to reflect allowable tax deductions that will be realized in the determination of our income tax liability and therefore reduce our future income tax payments 
our deferred tax asset increased by approximately million 
although our provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes did not change  our actual cash payments will be reduced as we utilize our deferred tax asset 
as a result of the receipt of cash for the exercise of options  the incurrence of additional compensation expense and the recognition of a deferred tax asset  our stockholders equity increased by approximately million in connection with the exercise of stock options 
in february certain options under our directors stock plan were exercised for the purchase of  shares of our common stock  for which we received approximately  in cash payment of the option exercise prices 
in may and june  certain options under our stock based incentive compensation plan and our directors stock plan were exercised for the purchase of  shares of our common stock 
as a result of the receipt of cash for the exercise of options  the incurrence of additional compensation expense for federal insurance corporation act taxes and the recognition of a deferred tax asset  our net stockholders equity increased by approximately million in connection with the exercise of these stock options 
summary of critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and may require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our members and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues from renewable research memberships are recognized over the term of the related subscription  which is generally months 
revenues from month best practices installation support memberships are recognized as services are performed  limited by our pro rated refund policy 
as a result  revenues for all programs are generally recognized ratably over the term of the related program agreement  which is typically months 
fees are generally billable  and revenue recognition begins  when an agreement is signed by the member 
certain fees are billed on an installment basis 
members may request a refund of their fees  which is provided on a pro rata basis relative to the length of time remaining in the service period 
our policy is to record the full amount of program agreement fees receivable and related deferred revenue when an agreement is signed by the member 
as of march  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of deferred revenues were to be recognized beyond the following twelve months 
allowance for uncollectible revenue our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our members has an effect on our operating performance and cash flows 
this effect is mitigated because memberships  which are predominantly annual contracts  are generally payable by members at the beginning of the contract term 
we record an allowance for uncollectible revenue based on our ongoing monitoring of our members credit and the aging of receivables 
deferred incentive compensation direct incentive compensation related to the negotiation of new and renewal memberships is deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the related memberships 
deferred tax asset recoverability for tax purposes  we have deferred income taxes consisting primarily of net operating loss carry forwards for regular federal and state income tax purposes generated from the exercise of common stock options 
in estimating future tax consequences  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
generally considers all expected future events in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we believe that our future taxable income will be sufficient for the full realization of the deferred income taxes 
however  sfas no 
does not consider the effect of future changes in existing tax laws or rates in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities until the new tax laws or rates are enacted 
we have established our deferred income tax assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax law and rates 
we will recognize an adjustment for the impact of new tax laws or rates on the existing deferred tax assets and liabilities when and if new tax laws or rates are enacted 
property and equipment property and equipment consists of furniture  fixtures  equipment and capitalized software development costs 
property and equipment is stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  ranging from three to seven years 
internal software development costs are accounted for in accordance with aicpa statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and web development costs are accounted for in accordance with eitf  accounting for web site development costs 
capitalized internal software development costs and capitalized web development costs are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to five years 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
recovery of long lived assets long lived assets and identifiable assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be addressed 
impairment is identified by comparing the carrying value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual dispositions 
impairment is measured and recorded on the basis of fair value determined using discounted cash flows 
we consider expected cash flows and estimated future operating results  trends and other available information in assessing whether the carrying value of assets is impaired 
we believe no such impairment existed as of march  or recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
though it retains the basic requirements of sfas no 
regarding when and how to measure an impairment loss  sfas no 
provides additional implementation guidance 
sfas no 
applies to long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of  including assets under capital leases of lessees  assets subject to operating leases of lessors  and prepaid assets 
sfas no 
also expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a component of an entity  and eliminates the current exemption to consolidation when control over a subsidiary is likely to be temporary 
sfas no 
 which we adopted in fiscal  did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
were adopted by the company for the year ending march  as allowed by sfas no 
 the company follows the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 but continues to account for its employee stock option plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which results in no charge to earnings when options are issued at or above fair market value 
therefore  at this time  the company has adopted the transition disclosure rules and does not expect that this statement will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which is designed for safety of principal and liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid us treasury obligations with maturities of less than three months 
at march   our marketable securities consist of million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by the district of columbia  million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by other states  and million in us government agency securities 
the average maturity on all our marketable securities as of march  was approximately years 
we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit ratings related to the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
this portfolio is subject to inherent interest rate risk as investments mature and are reinvested at current market interest rates 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our portfolio risk or income profile
