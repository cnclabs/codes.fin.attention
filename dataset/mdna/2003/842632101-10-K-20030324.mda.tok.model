item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following presents management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
all share data have been adjusted to give retroactive effect to stock splits and stock dividends 
the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
page critical accounting policy the company s most significant critical accounting policy is the determination of its allowance for loan losses 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both very important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
what makes these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex is the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
for further discussion  see nonperforming assets and analysis of allowance for loan losses under asset quality 
overview our founders recognized an opportunity to fulfill the financial service needs of individuals and organizations left underserved by consolidation within the financial services industry 
to fill a part of this void  we began in the process by which southern community financial corporation was created  finally beginning operations on november  in the banking office that still serves as our headquarters 
from inception  we have strived to serve the financial needs of small to medium sized businesses  individuals  residential homebuilders and others in and around winston salem and the piedmont triad area of north carolina 
we offer a broad array of banking and other financial products products similar to those offered by our larger competitors  but with an emphasis on superior customer service 
we believe that our emphasis on quality customer service is the single most important factor among many that have fueled our growth to million in total assets in just over six years of operations 
we began operations in november with million in capital  a single branch facility and thirteen employees 
through december   southern community financial corporation has grown to a total of eight full service banking offices with million in customer deposit accounts 
in support of this growth  we have generated million of additional capital through sales of common stock in  and we also have two subsidiaries offering financial services that augment our traditional banking products and services 
these subsidiaries are southeastern acceptance corporation consumer finance  and vcs management  llc manager of a small business investment company 
more recently we have created a trust department that began operating in the first quarter of in october of  we formed southern community financial corporation  a financial holding company  to become the parent company of southern community bank and trust 
during the first half of we expect to complete the construction of a new headquarters facility on property adjacent to our current headquarters in winston salem 
real estate secured loans  including construction loans and loans secured by existing commercial and residential properties  comprise the majority of our loan portfolio  with the balance of our loans consisting of commercial and industrial loans and loans to individuals 
through associations with various mortgage lending companies  we originate residential mortgages  at both fixed and variable rates  earning fees for loans originated and additional income for loans sold to others 
it has been our strategy to recruit skilled banking professionals who are well trained and highly knowledgeable about our market area  enabling us to develop and maintain a loan portfolio of sound credit quality 
we recognize that our growth may expose us to increased operational and market risk  primarily with respect to managing overhead  funding costs and credit quality 
we have developed critical functions such as training  audit  and credit administration to assist in managing and monitoring these and other risks 
we are committed to creating a solid and diversified financial services organization with a focus on customer service 
it is our firm belief that this foundation will continue building our loyal customer base while attracting new clients and providing opportunities for future growth 
as bank consolidations continue to take place in our marketplace  southern community financial corporation is positioned to continue to benefit from their effects 
financial condition at december  and during the year ended december   our total assets increased by million  or  to million 
of this increase in total assets  represented growth in interest earning assets 
continued strong loan demand drove an increase of  or  in net loans receivable  while investment securities available for sale and held to maturity increased by million and million  respectively 
the only category of interest earning assets that decreased was federal funds sold  which ended at million as compared with million at the end of federal funds sold provided the lowest yield among all interest earning assets  declining from at the beginning to at year end 
premises and equipment increased by million  principally as a result of the investment of  in a new branch facility located in kernersville  nc  and the investment of million in a new corporate headquarters that is scheduled for occupancy in the first half of other assets increased by million  including additional investments in bank owned life insurance of  our total investment in page bank owned life insurance at december  was million 
this investment is included in other assets in our balance sheet and yielded a tax exempt return of during the year loan growth in was concentrated in commercial and real estate lending 
our loan growth of million in was spread among our residential and commercial mortgage loans  which increased by million and million  respectively 
construction loans and loans to individuals increased by million and million  respectively  while commercial and industrial loans decreased by million 
during we continued our active program of originations of residential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market 
at the end of the year loans held for sale totaled million 
our total liquid assets  defined as cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and investment securities  increased by million during the year  to million at december  versus million at the beginning of the year 
liquid assets represented of total assets at december  as compared to at the beginning of the year 
we have been able to generate significant funds for investment both through deposit growth and through borrowings 
these available funds have exceeded our lending needs  so we have invested at a positive interest rate spread in securities 
in order to optimize our ability to manage interest rate risk  substantially all of our increased investment in liquid assets in has been in investments available for sale 
customer deposits continue to be our primary funding source 
while our deposits are primarily generated through our growing branch network  we do utilize some out of market and brokered deposits to support our funding base 
brokered and out of market deposits totaled million and million at year end and  respectively 
at december   deposits totaled million  an increase of million or from year end as explained above  we have also utilized borrowings to fund growth in total borrowings  including million in convertible preferred securities issued during  aggregated million at december  borrowings also included million from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb and securities sold under agreements to repurchase of million 
we will use fhlb advances and other funding sources as necessary to support balance sheet management and growth 
however  we believe that as our branch network grows and matures  the volume of core deposits will become a relatively larger portion of our funding mix  which should contribute to a reduction in our overall funding cost 
our capital position remains strong  with all of our regulatory capital ratios at levels that make us well capitalized under federal bank regulatory capital guidelines 
at december   our stockholders equity totaled million  an increase of million from the december  balance 
this increase includes net income of million earned during the year and other comprehensive income of million 
financial condition at december  and during the year ended december   our total assets increased by million  or  to million 
consistent with prior years  strong loan demand provided the primary impetus for this overall asset growth 
at december   loans totaled million  an increase of million or during the year 
this growth was spread among our mortgage  construction and commercial loans 
our commercial mortgage loans and non mortgage commercial loans increased by million and million  respectively  and collectively provided of our overall loan growth 
we also generated growth of million and million  respectively  in residential mortgage loans and construction loans 
our total liquid assets  defined as cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and investment securities  increased by million during the year  to million at december  versus million at the beginning of the year 
liquid assets represented of total assets at december  as compared to at the beginning of the year 
because of the significant rate cuts enacted by the federal reserve board  we chose to invest more heavily in investments held to maturity  which we increased by million to million at december  the higher yields on these investments helped to somewhat mitigate the effect of the overall declining trend in interest rates during the year 
customer deposits continue to be our primary funding source in at december   deposits totaled million  an increase of million or from year end during the fourth quarter of we opened two branches  which contributed to our deposit growth 
however  loan growth in outpaced our growth in deposits 
we therefore utilized borrowings from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb to fill this funding gap 
at december   our stockholders equity totaled million  an increase of million from the december  balance 
this increase includes net income of million earned during  proceeds of million received in february from the sale of  shares of our common stock and  of other comprehensive income 
page net interest income like most financial institutions  the primary component of our earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investments  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume and changes in interest rates earned and paid 
by volume  we mean the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
spread and margin are influenced by the levels and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as by levels of noninterest bearing liabilities 
during the years ended december   and  our average interest earning assets were million  million  and million  respectively 
during these same years  our net interest margins were  and  respectively 
average balances and average rates earned and paid 
the following table sets forth  for the years through  information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  resultant yields or costs  net interest income  net interest spread  net interest margin and ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities

our net income for was million  an increase of million from net income of million earned in net income per share was 
basic and 
diluted for the year ended december   up from 
basic and 
diluted for we have continued to experience strong growth  with total assets averaging million during the current year as compared to million in  an increase of 
our percentage growth in net interest income after provision for loan losses of exceeded our rate of asset growth  outpacing our increase in non interest expenses  which approximated our rate of asset growth 
in absolute terms  our net interest income after provision for loan losses increased by million and our non interest income grew by  well exceeding the increase of million in non interest expenses 
largely as a result of a lower level of net loan charge offs in  our provision for loan losses for the year of million was  lower than the provision of million made for interest rates  which declined dramatically during  were more stable at lower levels during this interest rate environment  combined with our growth in interest earning assets  yielded an increase of million in net interest income 
our expense growth included a full year of costs for the two new branches opened in and a partial year s costs for the new branch opened in  as well as personnel costs associated with expansion of our business 
these expenses represent investments in building our franchise  but their initial effect is to dampen earnings 
net interest income 
during  our net interest income increased by million or to million 
our growth in interest income was the result of growth in our overall level of average earning assets 
the rates earned on a significant page portion of our loans adjust immediately when index rates such as our prime rate change 
conversely  most of our interest bearing liabilities  including certificates of deposit and borrowings  have rates fixed until maturity 
as a result  interest rate reductions will generally result in an immediate drop in our interest income on loans  with a more delayed impact on interest expense because reductions in interest costs will only occur upon renewals of certificates of deposit or borrowings 
this affected our net interest income dramatically in in  however  interest rates were relatively stable at lower levels throughout the year 
as a result  the sustained lower rates affected our funding costs more than it did our asset yields  resulting in a basis point increase in our interest rate spread with a decline of only basis points in our net interest margin 
average total interest earning assets increased million  or  during as compared to  while our average yield dropped by basis points from to 
our average total interest bearing liabilities increased by million  or  consistent with our increase in interest earning assets 
with rates sustained at lower levels  our average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points from to  resulting in the basis point increase in our interest rate spread described above

provision for loan losses 
we recorded a million provision for loan losses for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  from the million provision we made for the year ended december  provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring our allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management based on the factors discussed under analysis of allowance for loan losses 
we have continued to increase the level of our allowance for loan losses principally as a result of the continued growth in our loan portfolio 
total loans receivable increased by million during  and by million during our reduced provision for loan losses for the current year was made largely in response the lower total of loan growth and to a decrease in net loan charge offs  which totaled  during  down from million on an annualized basis  our percentage of net loan charge offs to average loans outstanding was 
for the year ended december  as compared with 
for the year ended december  southeastern acceptance corporation  as a stand alone entity  experienced loan charge offs of  in  an increase of  from  in and represented and of average loans  respectively 
nonperforming loans totaled million or

of total loans at december  the allowance for loan losses at december  of million represents of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses at december  of million equaled of total loans outstanding at that date 
non interest income 
for the year ended december   non interest income increased  or to million from million for the prior year 
this favorable increase resulted from factors that include an increase of  or to million  in service charges and fees on deposit accounts as a result of deposit growth and an increase of  or to million  in income from the origination of residential mortgage loans sold into the secondary market 
we also generated an increase of  in investment brokerage fees and gains of  from sales of investment securities available for sale 
in aggregate  the increased level of core non interest income more than offset the effects of nonrecurring income of  realized in from an interest rate floor contract 
non interest expense 
we strive to maintain non interest expenses at levels that we believe are appropriate given the nature of our operations and the investments in personnel and facilities that have been necessary to support our growth 
from forward  we have consistently maintained our ratio of non interest expenses to average total assets below 
for our ratio was  up slightly from a ratio of in because of our continued strong growth we have continued to see increases in every major component of our non interest expenses 
for the year ended december   our non interest expense increased million  or 
salary and employee benefit expense increased million  or  and reflects the addition of personnel associated with branch expansion  additions of personnel to expand our lines of business  and normal increases in salaries and employee benefits 
occupancy and equipment expense increased  or  reflecting the expenses associated with our continued branch expansion and investments in technology to support our banking operations 
other non interest expenses increased  or  reflecting the increased volume of business activity  principally increases in lending and growth in deposit accounts 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before income taxes  was for each of the years ended december  and page results of operations years ended december  and net income 
our net income for was million  a decrease of  below net income of million earned in net income per share was 
basic and 
diluted for the year ended december   down from 
basic and 
diluted for we continued to experience strong growth in  with total assets averaging million during the current year as compared to million in  an increase of 
our percentage growth in non interest income of exceeded our rate of asset growth  while our increase in non interest expenses was below our rate of asset growth 
while such trends generally contribute to improved profitability  their positive effects were more than offset by an increase in our provision for loan losses coupled with the effects of declining interest rates that caused our interest rate spread and net yield on average interest earning assets to decline by basis points and basis points  respectively 
as a result  our increases of million in net interest income and million in non interest income were not enough to overcome the combined impact of increases of  in our provision for loan losses and million in our non interest expenses 
our expense growth included the costs of two new branches and additional branch personnel  as well as personnel costs associated with expansion of our business 
while these expenses represent investments in building our franchise  they are initially a drag on earnings 
also contributing to the decline in earnings per share was the increase in shares outstanding as result of our sale of  shares of common stock early in net interest income 
during  our net interest income increased by million or to million 
our total interest income benefited from strong growth in the level of average earning assets  which offset lower asset yields caused by the dramatic trend of declining interest rates throughout the period 
the rates earned on a significant portion of our loans adjust immediately when index rates such as our prime rate change 
conversely  most of our interest bearing liabilities  including certificates of deposit and borrowings  have rates fixed until maturity 
as a result  interest rate reductions will generally result in an immediate drop in our interest income on loans  with a more delayed impact on interest expense because reductions in interest costs will only occur upon renewals of certificates of deposit or borrowings 
average total interest earning assets increased million  or  during as compared to  while our average yield dropped by basis points from to 
our average total interest bearing liabilities increased by million  or  consistent with our increase in interest earning assets 
however  because our interest costs generally do not react as quickly to rate changes  our average cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased by only basis points from to  resulting in the compression in interest margins described above 
for the year ended december   our net interest spread was and our net interest margin was 
for the year ended december   our net interest spread was and our net interest margin was 
provision for loan losses 
we recorded a million provision for loan losses for the year ended december   representing an increase of  over the million provision we made for the year ended december  provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring our allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management based on the factors discussed under analysis of allowance for loan losses 
we have continued to increase the level of our allowance for loan losses principally as a result of the continued growth in our loan portfolio 
total loans receivable increased by million during  and by million during our higher provision for loan losses for was made largely in response to an increase in net loan charge offs  which totaled million during  up from  during the year ended december  on an annualized basis  our percentage of net loan charge offs to average loans outstanding was 
for the year ended december  as compared with 
for the year ended december  for all full fiscal years through  our loan loss experience was similar to that of other new banks  with net loan charge offs in each year of less than 
of average loans outstanding 
the increase in our net charge offs reflects the relatively higher charge offs associated with our consumer finance subsidiary  as well as the maturation of our loan portfolio 
during  our consumer finance subsidiary had net loan charge offs of  which was consistent with our budgeted level for that line of business 
on a stand alone basis  the rate of net loan charge offs to average loans outstanding in our bank was  which we believe reflects the maturation and seasoning of our loan portfolio

this favorable increase resulted from factors that include an increase of  or to  in service charges and fees on deposit accounts as a result of deposit growth  an increase of  or to million  in income from the origination of residential mortgage loans sold into the secondary market and income of  realized from an interest rate floor contract 
page non interest expense 
we strive to maintain non interest expenses at levels that we believe are appropriate given the nature of our operations and the investments in personnel and facilities that have been necessary to generate our growth 
from forward  we have consistently maintained our ratio of non interest expenses to average total assets below

for the year ended december   on an annualized basis  our ratio of non interest expenses to average total assets improved to as compared with for provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before income taxes  was and  respectively  for the years ended december  and the decline in the effective rate for the current period principally results from a higher level of investments that are not subject to state income taxes 
liquidity market and public confidence in our financial strength and in the strength of financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity 
this confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital resources 
the term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs for funding loan originations  deposit withdrawals  maturities of borrowings and operating expenses 
management measures our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on and off balance sheet sources of  and demands for  funds on a daily and weekly basis 
sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities  investment securities eligible for pledging to secure borrowings from correspondent banks pursuant to securities sold under repurchase agreements  investments available for sale  loan repayments  loan sales  deposits  and borrowings from the federal home loan bank secured with pledged loans and securities  and from correspondent banks under overnight federal funds credit lines 
in addition to interest rate sensitive deposits  the company s primary demand for liquidity is anticipated fundings under credit commitments to customers 
because of our continued growth and the availability of relatively low cost funding sources  we have maintained a high level of liquidity in the form of federal funds sold and investment securities 
these aggregated million at december   compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
supplementing customer deposits as a source of funding  we have available lines of credit from various correspondent banks to purchase federal funds on a short term basis of approximately million 
we also have the ability to borrow up to million  as of december   from the federal home loan bank of atlanta  with million outstanding as of that date 
at december  we had fhlb borrowings outstanding of million 
funding costs have been low during  and we have taken advantage of favorable interest rates offered by the fhlb to provide funding for increased investments 
we also had repurchase agreements with a total outstanding balance of million at december  securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within ninety days from the transaction date and are collateralized by us government agency obligations 
we have repurchase lines of credit aggregating million from various institutions 
the repurchases must be adequately collateralized 
at december   our outstanding commitments to extend credit consisted of loan commitments of million and amounts available under home equity credit lines  other credit lines and standby letters of credit of million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that our combined aggregate liquidity position from all sources is sufficient to meet the funding requirements of loan demand and deposit maturities and withdrawals in the near term 
throughout our six year history  our loan demand has exceeded our growth in core deposits 
we have therefore relied heavily on certificates of deposits as a source of funds 
while the majority of these funds are from our local market area  the bank has utilized brokered and out of market certificates of deposits to diversify and supplement our deposit base 
certificates of deposits represented of our total deposits at december   down slightly from at december  brokered and out of market deposits totaled million at year end and million at year end  which page comprised and of total deposits  respectively 
certificates of deposit of  or more represented of our total deposits at december  and at december  a portion of these deposits are controlled by members of our board of directors and advisory board members  or otherwise comes from customers considered to have long standing relationships with our management 
based upon the nature of these relationships  management does not believe we are subject to significant liquidity risk related to these deposits 
certificates of deposit of  or more  exclusive of these relationships  constituted of our total deposits at december  large certificates of deposits are generally considered rate sensitive 
while we will need to pay competitive rates to retain these deposits at their maturities  there are other subjective factors that will determine their continued retention 
contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business there are various outstanding contractual obligations of the company that will require future cash outflows 
in addition  there are commitments and contingent liabilities  such as commitments to extend credit  that may or may not require future cash outflows 
the following table reflects contractual obligations of the company outstanding as of december  payments due by period on demand or within after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands short term borrowings long term debt convertible preferred securities construction of operation properties operating leases total contractual cash obligations excluding deposits deposits total contractual cash obligations the following table reflects other commitments of the company outstanding as of december  amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts within after other commitments committed year years years years in thousands undisbursed portion of home equity credit lines collateralized primarily by junior liens on family properties other commitments and credit lines undisbursed portion of construction loans fixed rate mortgage loan commitments adjustable rate mortgage loan commitments total other commitments page capital resources stockholders equity at december  was million

at december  actual minimum well capitalized ratio requirement requirement total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio in february of  southern community capital trust i the trust  a newly formed subsidiary of the company  issued  convertible preferred securities the securities  generating total proceeds of million 
the securities pay distributions at an annual rate of and mature on march  the securities began paying distributions quarterly on march  the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of the trust 
the securities can be converted at any time into common stock at a price of the conversion price or approximately shares of the company s common stock for each convertible preferred security 
the securities issued by the trust are redeemable in whole or in part at any time after april  the securities are also redeemable in whole at any time prior to march  as long as the trading price of our common stock has been at least of the conversion price for a period of twenty consecutive trading days ending within five days of the notice of redemption 
the proceeds from the securities were utilized to purchase convertible junior subordinated debentures from the company under the same terms and conditions as the securities 
the company has the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures at any time and from time to time for a period not exceeding five years  provided that no deferral period extend beyond the stated maturities of the debentures 
such deferral of interest payments by the company will result in a deferral of distribution payments on the related securities 
should the company defer the payment of interest on the debentures  the company will be precluded from the payment of cash dividends to shareholders 
subject to certain limitations  the securities qualify as tier capital of the company for regulatory capital purposes 
the principal use of the net proceeds from the sale of the securities was to infuse capital to our bank subsidiary  southern community bank and trust  to fund its operations and continued expansion  and to maintain the company s and the bank s status as well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
asset liability management our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the market place 
the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting earnings from undue interest rate risk  which arises from volatile interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk and capital adequacy 
we adhere to a board approved asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling  monitoring  and reporting exposure to interest rate risk 
our policy is to manage the company s net interest income exposure by measuring the impact of changing interest rate environments and adjusting the mix of assets and liabilities to provide an acceptable return within established risk limits 
net interest income simulation and gap reports in conjunction with other tools are utilized to measure and monitor interest rate risk 
when suitable lending opportunities are not sufficient to utilize available funds  we have generally invested such funds in securities  primarily securities issued by governmental agencies and mortgage backed securities 
the securities portfolio contributes to profitability and plays an important part in our overall interest rate risk management 
however  management of the securities portfolio alone cannot balance overall interest rate risk 
the securities portfolio must be used in combination with other asset liability techniques to actively manage the balance sheet 
the primary objectives in the overall management of the securities portfolio are safety  liquidity  yield  asset liability management interest rate risk  and investing in securities that can be pledged for public deposits or for borrowings 
page in reviewing the needs of our bank with regard to proper management of its asset liability program  we estimate future needs  taking into consideration estimated loan and deposit increases due to increased demand through marketing and forecasted interest rate changes 
we use a number of measures to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including income simulations and gap analyses 
an income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets  cash flows and maturities of other investment securities  loan and deposit volumes and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
based on the results of the income simulation model as of october   we would expect an increase in net interest income of million if interest rates increase from current rates by basis points over the next twelve months  and a decrease in net interest income of  if interest rates decrease from current rates by basis points over the next twelve months 
the analysis of interest rate gap the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities re pricing or maturing during a given period of time is another standard tool we use to measure exposure to interest rate risk 
we believe that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance  it should be used in conjunction with other methods of evaluating interest rate risk 
our balance sheet was asset sensitive at december  in the three month horizon and liability sensitive in the one year period 
an asset sensitive position means that there are more assets than liabilities subject to repricing in that period as market rates change  and conversely with a liability sensitive position 
as a result  in a falling rate environment  our earnings position could deteriorate initially followed by improvement  with the opposite expectation in a rising rate environment  depending on the correlation of rate changes in these categories 
the following table presents information about the periods in which the interest sensitive assets and liabilities at december  will either mature or be subject to repricing in accordance with market rates  and the resulting interest sensitivity gaps 
this table shows the sensitivity of the balance sheet at one point in time and is not necessarily indicative of what the sensitivity will be on other dates 
included in interest bearing liabilities subject to rate changes within days is of the money market and now deposits 
these types of deposits historically have not repriced coincidentally with or in the same proportion as general market indicators 
as simplifying assumptions concerning repricing behavior  all money market and now deposits are assumed to reprice immediately and fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities are assumed to reprice at their contractual maturity

this risk of loss can be reflected in diminished current market values and or reduced potential net interest income in future periods 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities 
the structure of our loan and deposit portfolios is such that a significant decline in interest rates may adversely impact net market values and net interest income

real estate loans 
real estate loans represent our greatest concentration of loans  and are divided into three categories residential mortgage  commercial mortgage  and construction loans 
we make real estate loans for purchasing  constructing and refinancing one to four family residential  five or more family residential and commercial properties 
we also make loans secured by real estate to commercial and individual borrowers who use the loan proceeds for other purposes 
our real estate loans totaled million at december   representing of our total loans outstanding 
our loan policy requires appraisal prior to funding a real estate loan and also outlines the requirements for appraisals on renewals 
we pursue an aggressive policy of evaluation and monitoring on any real estate loan that becomes troubled  including reappraisal when appropriate 
we recognize and reserve for potential exposures as soon as we identify them 
however  the pace of absorption of real properties is affected both by each property s individual nature and characteristics  the status of the real estate market at the time  general economic conditions and other factors that could adversely affect our volume of non performing real estate loans and our ability to dispose of foreclosed properties without loss 
residential mortgage loans 
many of the fixed rate one to four family owner occupied residential mortgage loans that we make are originated for the account of third parties 
we provide our customers access to long term conventional real estate loans through the origination of federal national mortgage association conforming loans for the account of third parties 
many of these loans are closed by the third party and therefore are not shown in our financial statements 
in addition  during we began to originate loans for sale in the secondary market 
residential mortgage loans held for sale totaled million at december  we receive income from residential mortgage loans originated for others or for sale in the secondary market  with such fees aggregating million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we anticipate that we will continue to be an active originator of residential loans for sale and for the account of third parties 
residential loans are generated through our in house staff as well as the bank s existing customer base  referrals from real estate agents and builders  and local marketing efforts 
our lending efforts include the origination of loans secured by first mortgages on one to four family residences and on home equity credit lines 
our residential mortgage loans totaled million at december   and included million in one to four family permanent mortgage loans  million in outstanding advances under home equity credit lines  and million of other loans secured by residential real estate 
of our residential mortgage loans  have variable rates of interest while have fixed interest rates 
substantially all of our residential mortgage loans are secured by properties located within our market area  although we will make loans secured by properties outside our market area to qualifying existing customers 
we believe that the amount of risk associated with this group of loans is mitigated in part due to the type of loans involved 
historically  the amount of losses suffered on this type of loan has been significantly less than those loans collateralized by other types of properties 
page our one to four family residential loans generally have maturities ranging from to years 
these loans are either fully amortizing with monthly payments sufficient to repay the total amount of the loan or amortizing with a balloon feature  typically due in fifteen years or less 
we review information concerning the income  financial condition  employment history and credit history when evaluating the creditworthiness of an applicant for a residential mortgage loan 
commercial mortgage loans 
our commercial mortgage loans totaled million at december  these loans are secured principally by commercial buildings for office  retail  manufacturing  storage and warehouse properties 
generally in underwriting commercial mortgage loans  we require the personal guaranty of borrowers and a demonstrated cash flow capability sufficient to service the debt 
loans secured by commercial real estate may be in greater amount and involve a greater degree of risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans  and payments on such loans are often dependent on successful operation or management of the properties and the underlying businesses 
we make commercial mortgage loans at both fixed and variable rates for terms generally up to years 
of our commercial mortgage loans  have variable rates of interest while have fixed interest rates 
construction loans 
we originate one to four family residential construction loans for the construction of custom homes where the home buyer is the borrower  and we provide construction financing to builders 
we have a staff of lending professionals and assistants who service only our construction loan portfolio 
we generally receive a pre arranged permanent financing commitment from an outside banking entity prior to financing the construction of pre sold homes 
we lend to builders who have demonstrated a favorable record of performance and profitable operations and who are building in our market area 
we also make commercial real estate construction loans  as noted in the preceding paragraph 
we endeavor to limit our construction lending risk through adherence to established underwriting procedures 
also  we generally require documentation of all draw requests and utilize loan officers to inspect the project prior to paying any draw requests from the builder 
with few exceptions  the bank requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment on construction loans 
construction loans aggregated million at december  commercial loans 
commercial business lending is a primary focus of our lending activities 
at december   our commercial loan portfolio equaled million or of total loans 
commercial loans include both secured and unsecured loans for working capital  expansion  and other business purposes 
short term working capital loans generally are secured by accounts receivable  inventory and or equipment 
the bank also makes term commercial loans secured by equipment and real estate 
lending decisions are based on an evaluation of the financial strength  management and credit history of the borrower  and the quality of the collateral securing the loan 
with few exceptions  the bank requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment 
commercial loans generally provide greater yields and re price more frequently than other types of loans  such as real estate loans 
more frequent re pricing means that yields on our commercial loans adjust with changes in interest rates 
loans to individuals 
loans to individuals include automobile loans  boat and recreational vehicle financing  and miscellaneous secured and unsecured personal loans 
consumer loans generally can carry significantly greater risks than other loans  even if secured  if the collateral consists of rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles and equipment 
repossessed collateral securing a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the loan 
we attempt to manage the risks inherent in consumer lending by following established credit guidelines and underwriting practices designed to minimize risk of loss 
loan approvals 
our loan policies and procedures establish the basic guidelines governing our lending operations 
generally  the guidelines address the type of loans that we seek  our target markets  underwriting and collateral requirements  terms  interest rate and yield considerations and compliance with laws and regulations 
all loans or credit lines are subject to approval procedures and amount limitations 
these limitations apply to the borrower s total outstanding indebtedness to us  including the indebtedness of any guarantor 
the policies are reviewed and approved at least annually 
we supplement our supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan audits by independent  outside professionals experienced in loan review work 
individual lending authorities are established by the board of directors as periodically requested by management 
all individual lending authorities are reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors 
the board loan committee consists of the ceo  president  managing svp of commercial lending  vp in charge of credit administration  and four outside directors as appointed by the board of directors 
this committee meets on a monthly page basis to review for approval all loan requests in excess of million 
as of december   the legal lending limit for the bank was approximately million 
asset quality we consider asset quality to be of primary importance 
we employ a formal internal loan review process to ensure adherence to the lending policy as approved by the board of directors 
it is the responsibility of each lending officer to assign an appropriate risk grade to every loan originated 
credit administration  through the loan review process  validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment 
in addition  as a given loan s credit quality improves or deteriorates  it is credit administration s responsibility to change the borrowers risk grade accordingly 
the function of determining the allowance for loan losses is fundamentally driven by the risk grade system 
as part of the loan review function  we use a third party professional to review the underwriting documentation and risk grading analysis 
in determining the allowance for loan losses and any resulting provision to be charged against earnings  particular emphasis is placed on the results of the loan review process 
we also give consideration to historical loan loss experience  the value and adequacy of collateral  economic conditions in our market area and other factors 
for loans determined to be impaired  the allowance is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the appropriate level of reserve to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our policy in regard to past due loans normally requires a prompt charge off to the allowance for loan losses following timely collection efforts and a thorough review 
further efforts are then pursued through various means available 
loans carried in a non accrual status are generally collateralized and probable losses are considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
nonperforming assets the table sets forth  for the period indicated  information about our nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  total nonperforming loans nonaccrual loans plus restructured loans  and total nonperforming assets 
at december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans real estate owned total nonperforming assets accruing loans past due days or more allowance for loan losses nonperforming loans to period end loans allowance for loan losses to period end loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans  nm  nonperforming assets to total assets page our financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on loans  unless we place a loan on nonaccrual basis 
we account for loans on a nonaccrual basis when we have serious doubts about the collectibility of principal or interest 
generally  our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan becomes past due days 
we also place loans on nonaccrual status in cases where we are uncertain whether the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
we record interest on restructured loans at the restructured rates  as collected  when we anticipate that no loss of original principal will occur 
potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing and are not included in nonaccrual or restructured loans above  but about which we have serious doubts as to the borrower s ability to comply with present repayment terms 
these loans are likely to be included later in nonaccrual  past due or restructured loans  so they are considered by our management in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
at december   we had identified million of potential problem loans 
at december   we had million of nonaccrual loans 
at that time  the largest nonaccrual balance to any one borrower was  with the average balance for the nonaccrual loans being  interest on nonaccrual loans foregone was approximately  for the year ended december    for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  subsequent to december   a loan of million to a country club was placed in nonaccrual status as a result of the borrower s filing for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
however  the bank has a secured position and management believes there will be no significant loss associated with this credit 
real estate owned consists of foreclosed  repossessed and idled properties 
at december  real estate owned totaled  or 
of total assets  and consisted of four commercial and residential properties 
we have reviewed recent appraisals of these properties and believe that their fair value  less estimated costs to sell  exceed their carrying value 
analysis of allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by provisions charged to operations and by recoveries of amounts previously charged off  and we reduce our allowance by loans charged off 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance at least quarterly 
in addition  on a quarterly basis our board of directors reviews our loan portfolio  conducts an evaluation of our credit quality and reviews our computation of the loan loss provision  recommending changes as may be required 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance  we consider the growth  composition and industry diversification of the portfolio  historical loan loss experience  current delinquency levels  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors deriving from our limited history of operations 
because we have a limited history of our own  we also consider the loss experience and allowance levels of other similar banks and the historical experience encountered by our management and senior lending officers prior to joining us 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to make adjustments for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of our management 
we use our risk grading program  as described under asset quality  to facilitate our evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in this program  risk grades are initially assigned by loan officers  reviewed by credit administration  and tested by our internal auditor and by an independent professional 
the testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans  large loans  loans that are identified as having potential credit weaknesses  loans past due days or more  and nonaccrual loans 
we strive to maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of our market area 
every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies 
we have no foreign loans and we do not engage in lease financing or highly leveraged transactions 
we follow a loan review program designed to evaluate the credit risk in our loan portfolio 
through this loan review process  we maintain an internally classified watch list that helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets  management considers  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the borrower s ability to repay  the borrower s payment history and the current status 
as a result of this process  certain loans are categorized as substandard  doubtful or loss and reserves are allocated based on management s judgment and historical experience 
loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
they are page characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some losses if the deficiencies are not corrected 
a reserve of up to is generally allocated to each of these loans 
loans classified as doubtful are those loans that have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable 
a reserve of is generally allocated to loans classified as doubtful 
loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted 
this classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future 
as a practical matter  when loans are identified as loss they are charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the above classification categories  we also categorize loans based upon risk grade and loan type  assigning an allowance allocation based upon each category 
growth in loans outstanding has  throughout our history  been the primary reason for increases in our allowance for loan losses and the resultant provisions for loan losses necessary to provide for those increases 
this growth has been spread among our major loan categories  with the concentrations of major loan categories being relatively consistent in recent years 
between december  and december   the range of each major category of loans as a percentage of total loans outstanding is as follows residential mortgage loans to  commercial mortgage loans to  construction loans to  commercial and industrial loans to  and loans to individuals to 
for all full fiscal years through  our loan loss experience was similar to that of other new banks  with net loan charge offs in each year of less than 
of average loans outstanding 
our percentage of net loan charge offs to average loans outstanding was 
for the year ended december  the higher level of net loan charge offs during was a significant factor contributing to the increased provision for loan losses compared to our percentage of net loan charge offs to average loans outstanding dropped to 
for  and as a result our provision for loan losses for the year was reduced from the amount 
our allowance for loan losses at december  of million represents of total loans and of nonperforming loans 
as discussed under nonperforming assets  subsequent to the end of a loan in the amount of million has been placed on nonaccrual status 
if this loan had been classified as nonaccrual at december   our percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans would have increased from 
to 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business 
we make specific allowances that are allocated to certain individual loans and pools of loans based on risk characteristics  as discussed below 
in addition to the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses  we maintain an unallocated portion that is not assigned to any specific category of loans 
this unallocated portion is intended to reserve for the inherent risk in the portfolio and the intrinsic inaccuracies associated with the estimation of the allowance for loan losses and its allocation to specific loan categories 
while management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
furthermore  while we believe we have established the allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing our portfolio  will not require adjustments to our allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed herein 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

the securities portfolio generates a substantial percentage of our interest income and serves as a necessary source of liquidity 
we account for investment securities as follows held to maturity 
debt securities for which we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at their remaining unpaid principal balance  net of unamortized premiums or unaccreted discounts 
premiums are amortized and discounts are accreted using a method that approximates the level interest yield method over the estimated remaining term of the underlying security 
available for sale 
debt and equity securities that will be held for indeterminate periods of time  including securities that we may sell in response to changes in market interest or prepayment rates  needs for liquidity and changes in the availability of and the yield of alternative investments are classified as available for sale 
we carry these investments at market value  which we generally determine using published quotes as of the close of business 
unrealized gains and losses are excluded from our earnings and are reported  net of applicable income tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity until realized 
management attempts to deploy investable funds into instruments that are expected to increase the overall return of the portfolio given the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  while maintaining acceptable levels of capital  and interest rate and liquidity risk

page derivative financial instruments a derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows  and therefore its value  by reference to an underlying instrument  index or reference rate 
these instruments primarily consist of interest rate swaps  caps  floors  financial forward and futures contracts and options written or purchased 
derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as notional amounts 
notional amounts only provide the basis for calculating payments between counterparties and do not represent amounts to be exchanged between parties and are not a measure of financial risks 
credit risk arises when amounts receivable from a counterparty exceed amounts payable 
we control our risk of loss on derivative contracts by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit 
late in  in anticipation of declining interest rates  we bought an interest rate floor contract with a notional amount of million  which we subsequently sold in we recognized income aggregating  on this floor contract in  including the gain realized upon its disposal  in non interest income 
we have also used interest rate swaps in the management of interest rate risk 
interest rate swaps are contractual agreements between two parties to exchange a series of cash flows representing interest payments 
a swap allows both parties to alter the repricing characteristics of assets or liabilities without affecting the underlying principal positions 
through the use of a swap  assets and liabilities may be transformed from fixed to floating rates  from floating rates to fixed rates  or from one type of floating rate to another 
swap terms generally range from one year to ten years depending on the need 
at december   swap derivatives with a total notional value of million  with terms ranging up to three years  were outstanding 
the net interest payable or receivable on interest rate swaps that are designated as hedges is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to the interest income or expense of the related asset or liability 
gains and losses from early terminations of derivatives are deferred and amortized as yield adjustments over the shorter of the remaining term of the hedged asset or liability or the remaining term of the derivative instrument 
upon disposition or settlement of the asset or liability being hedged  deferral accounting is discontinued and any gains or losses are recognized in income 
derivative financial instruments that fail to qualify as a hedge are carried at fair value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings 
the following table sets forth certain information concerning our interest rate swaps at december  type dollars in thousands receive fixed swaps notional amounts receive rate pay rate daily average prime fair value year to date activity balance  december  additions maturities amortizations sales terminations balance  december  maturity schedule one to five years the million notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at december  are being used to hedge prime rate based commercial loans 
we do not utilize derivatives for trading purposes 
although off balance sheet derivative financial instruments do not expose the company to credit risk equal to the notional amount  such agreements generate credit risk to the extent of the fair value gain in an off balance sheet derivative financial instrument if the counterparty fails to perform 
such risk is minimized through the creditworthiness of the counterparties and the consistent monitoring of these agreements 
the counterparties to these arrangements were primarily large commercial banks and investment banks 
where appropriate  master netting agreements are arranged or collateral is page obtained in the form of rights to securities 
at december   our interest rate swaps reflected an unrealized gain of million  which included unrealized gains from the early termination of derivatives in the amount of  this gain is being amortized into income over the life of the original contract term 
other risks associated with interest sensitive derivatives include the effect on fixed rate positions during periods of changing interest rates 
indexed amortizing swaps notional amounts and maturities change based on certain interest rate indices 
generally  as rates fall the notional amounts decline more rapidly  and as rates increase notional amounts decline more slowly 
at december   we had no indexed amortizing swaps outstanding 
under unusual circumstances  financial derivatives also increase liquidity risk  which could result from an environment of rising interest rates in which derivatives produce negative cash flows while being offset by increased cash flows from variable rate loans 
such risk is considered insignificant due to the relatively small derivative positions we hold 
sources of funds deposit activities we provide a range of deposit services  including non interest bearing checking accounts  interest bearing checking and savings accounts  money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
these accounts generally earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and our desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits 
we have used brokered deposits and out of market deposits as funding sources 
as of december   we have million of brokered deposits and million of out of market deposits 
however  we strive to establish customer relations to attract core deposits in non interest bearing transactional accounts and thus to reduce our costs of funds

as set forth in the following table  outstanding advances at december  totaled million  and are secured by loans with a carrying amount of million  which approximates market value  and investment securities with a market value of million 
available additional borrowings  based on the collateral value of these assets  was million at december  interest year of maturity rate amount in thousands thereafter in addition to the federal home loan bank advances  we also had a repurchase agreement with an outstanding balance of million at december  securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within ninety days from the transaction date and are collateralized by us government agency obligations 
the bank has repurchase lines of credit aggregating million from various institutions 
the repurchases must be adequately collateralized 
in addition  we may purchase federal funds through unsecured federal funds lines of credit with various banks aggregating million 
these lines are intended for short term borrowings and are subject to restrictions limiting the frequency and term of advances 
these lines of credit are payable on demand and bear interest based upon the daily federal funds rate 
we had no borrowings outstanding under these lines as of december  borrowings that are scheduled to be repaid within one year are classified as short term borrowings

the securities pay distributions at an annual rate of and mature on march  the securities began paying distributions quarterly on march  the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of the trust 
the securities can be converted at any time into common stock at a price of the conversion price or approximately shares of the company s common stock for each convertible preferred security 
the securities issued by the trust are redeemable in whole or in part at any time after april  the securities are also redeemable in whole at any time prior to march  as long as the trading price of our common stock has been at least of the conversion price for a period of twenty consecutive trading days ending within five days of the notice of redemption 
the proceeds from the securities were utilized to purchase convertible junior subordinated debentures from us under the same terms and conditions as the securities 
the company has the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures at any time and from time to time for a period not exceeding five years  provided that no deferral period extend beyond the stated maturities of the debentures 
such deferral of interest payments by the company will result in a deferral of distribution payments on the related securities 
should the company defer the payment of interest on the debentures  the company will be precluded from the payment of cash dividends to shareholders 
subject to certain limitations  the securities qualify as tier capital of the company for regulatory capital purposes 
the principal use of the net proceeds from the sale of the convertible debentures is to infuse capital to our bank subsidiary  southern community bank and trust  to fund its operations and continued expansion  and to maintain the bank s status as well capitalized under regulatory guidelines
