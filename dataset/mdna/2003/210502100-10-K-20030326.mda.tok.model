item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report 
the company s consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations as of and for the year ended december  include the results of operations of mfn financial corporation for the period subsequent to march   the merger date  through december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview consumer portfolio services  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  the company primarily engage in the business of purchasing  selling and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts contracts originated by automobile dealers dealers located throughout the united states 
through its purchase of contracts  the company provides indirect financing to dealer customers with limited credit histories  low incomes or past credit problems  who generally would not be expected to qualify for financing provided by banks or by automobile manufacturers captive finance companies 
on march   the company acquired of mfn financial corporation  a delaware corporation mfn and its subsidiaries  by the merger the merger of cps mergersub  inc  a delaware corporation mergersub and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of cps  with and into mfn 
in the merger  mfn became a wholly owned subsidiary of cps 
the company thus acquired the assets of mfn  consisting principally of interests in automobile installment sales finance contracts and the facilities for originating and servicing such contracts 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase 
mfn  through its primary operating subsidiary  mercury finance company llc  was engaged in business substantially similar to that of the company purchasing automobile installment sales finance contracts from dealers  and securitizing and servicing such contracts 
the company historically has generated revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of its contracts  servicing fees earned on contracts sold  and interest earned on residuals  as defined below  and on finance receivables 
in the years ended december  and  the company did not sell any contracts in securitization transactions  and therefore recognized no gains on sale from securitization transactions 
all sales of contracts during were on a servicing released basis  either in the form of bulk sales of contracts being held by the company for sale  or as part of a flow through agreement with a third party for which the company earned fees on a per contract basis  also known as the flow purchase program or purchases made on a flow basis 
during the year ended december   the company entered into another flow through agreement and proceeded to sell nearly all of the contracts purchased during the year to one or the other third party  for a mark up above what the company paid the dealer 
the company recorded a loss of million related to bulk sales in there were no bulk sales during or as a result of the company s flow through sales during the years ended december   and  the company recognized gain on sale of contracts of million  million and million  respectively 
one of the two flow purchasers ceased to purchase contracts in december  and the other has in may the flow purchase program accordingly ended at that time 
the company s securitization structure has generally been as follows the company sells a portfolio of contracts to a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary sps  which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the company s contracts 
the sps then transfers the same contracts to an owner trust trust 
the trust is a qualifying special purpose entity as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  and is therefore not consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the trust issues interest bearing asset backed securities the notes  generally in a principal amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the contracts 
the company typically sells these contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse  except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to the company are provided by the company to the trust 
one or more investors purchase the notes issued by the trust  the proceeds from the sale of the notes are then used to purchase the contracts from the company 
the company may retain subordinated notes issued by the trust 
the company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy  guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior notes  from an insurance company the note insurers 
in addition  the company provides a credit enhancement for the benefit of the note insurers and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account spread account held by the trust or in the form of subordinated notes  or both 
the agreements governing the securitization transactions collectively referred to as the securitization agreements require that the initial deposits to the spread accounts be supplemented by a portion of collections from the contracts until the spread accounts reach specified levels  and then maintained at those levels 
the specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related notes 
the specified levels at which the spread accounts are to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions  and may also be varied by agreement among the company  the sps  the note insurers and the trustee 
such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the portfolios  and have also varied by securitization agreement 
the securitization agreements generally grant the company the option to repurchase the sold contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance has amortized to or less of the initial aggregate balance 
the company s continuous securitization structure is similar to the above  except that i the sps that purchases the contracts pledges the contracts to secure promissory notes issued directly by the sps  ii the initial purchaser of such notes has the right  but not the obligation  to require that the company repurchase the contracts  iii the promissory notes are in an aggregate principal amount of not more than to of the aggregate principal balance of the contracts that is  up to over collateralization  and iv no spread account is involved 
the sps is a qualifying special purpose entity and is therefore not consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
upon each sale of contracts in a securitization  whether a term securitization or a continuous securitization  the company removes from its consolidated balance sheet the contracts held for sale and adds to its consolidated balance sheet i the cash received and ii the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the company retains in contracts sold in the securitization 
that retained interest the residual consists of a the cash held in the spread account  if any  b over collateralization  if any  c subordinated notes retained  if any  and d receivables from trust  which include the net interest receivables nirs 
nirs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received from the trust in the future  net of principal and interest payable with respect to the notes  and certain expenses 
the excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the company over the carrying value of the contracts sold  less transaction costs  equals the net gain on sale of contracts recorded by the company 
the company allocates its basis in the contracts between the notes and the residuals sold and retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale 
the company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the residuals  which are recorded at estimated fair value 
the company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the residuals  accordingly  the company determines the estimated fair value of the residuals by discounting the amount and timing of anticipated cash flows that it estimates will be released to the company in the future the cash out method  using a discount rate that the company believes is appropriate for the risks involved 
the company estimates the value of its optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the securitization agreements primarily based on its estimate of the amount and timing of cash flows that it anticipates will be received from the repurchased receivables following exercise of the optional right 
the anticipated cash flows include collections from both current and charged off receivables 
the company has used an effective discount rate of approximately per annum  which it believes is appropriate for the risks involved 
the company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts 
in addition  the company is entitled to the cash flows from the residuals that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the notes  the base servicing fees  and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees 
required principal payments are in most cases defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of the notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related contracts excluding those contracts that have been charged off 
some of the securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the notes is reduced to a specified percentage of the aggregate principal balance of the related contracts 
such accelerated principal payment is said to create over collateralization of the notes 
if the amount of cash required for payment of fees  interest and principal exceeds the amount collected during the collection period  the shortfall is drawn from the spread account  if any 
if the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations  and there is no shortfall in the related spread account  the excess is released to the company  or in certain cases is transferred to other spread accounts that may be below their required levels 
if the spread account balance is not at the required credit enhancement level  then the excess cash collected is retained in the spread account until the specified level is achieved 
although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of the company s sps as the owner of the residuals  the cash in the spread accounts is restricted from use by the company 
cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality  liquid investment securities  as specified in the securitization agreements 
the interest rate payable on the contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the notes 
as a result  the residuals described above are a significant asset of the company 
in determining the value of the residuals  the company must estimate the future rates of prepayments  delinquencies  defaults and default loss severity  and the value of the company s optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the terms of the securitization agreements  as all of these factors affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows 
the company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable contracts 
the company has used prepayment estimates of approximately to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts 
the company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable contracts and the specific characteristics of the contracts purchased by the company 
the company estimates recovery rates of previously charged off receivables using available historical recovery data and projected future recovery levels 
in valuing the residuals  the company estimates that gross losses as a percentage of the original principal balance will approximate to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts  with recovery rates approximating to of the original principal balance 
in future periods  the company will recognize additional revenue from the residuals if the actual performance of the contracts is better than the original estimate  or the company would increase the estimated fair value of the residuals 
if the actual performance of the contracts were worse than the original estimate  then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the residuals would be required 
the noteholders and the related securitization trusts have no recourse to the company for failure of the contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis 
the company s residuals  however  are subordinate to the notes until the noteholders are fully paid  and the company is therefore at risk to that extent 
see critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies the company believes that its accounting policies related to a allowance for finance credit losses  b residual interest in securitizations and gain on sale of contracts and c income taxes could be considered critical 
such policies are described below 
a allowance for finance credit losses in order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses to be incurred on finance receivables  the company uses a loss reserving methodology commonly referred to as static pooling  which stratifies its finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools 
using analytical and formula driven techniques  the company estimates an allowance for finance credit losses  which management believes is adequate for known and inherent losses in the finance receivable contract portfolio 
provision for loss is charged to the company s consolidated statement of operations 
charge offs are charged to the allowance 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies  the characteristics of the portfolio and the value of the underlying collateral 
as conditions change  the company s level of provisioning and or allowance may change as well 
b residual interest in securitizations and gain on sale of contracts gain on sale may be recognized on the disposition of contracts either outright or in securitization transactions 
in its securitization transactions  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company retains a residual interest in the contracts that are sold 
the company s securitization transactions include term securitizations purchaser holds the contracts for substantially their entire term and continuous securitizations the contracts sold may be put back to the company  and subsequently replaced with other contracts 
the residual interest in term securitizations and the residual interest in the contracts sold continuously are reflected in the line item residual interest in securitizations on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
in either case  the residual interest represents the discounted sum of expected future releases from securitization trusts 
accordingly  the valuation of the residual is heavily dependent on estimates of future performance 
the key economic assumptions used in measuring all retained interests remaining as of december  and are included in the table below 
the discount rate remained constant at 
prepayment speed cumulative credit losses cumulative key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate and adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows december  dollars in thousands carrying amount fair value of residual interest in securitizations  weighted average life in years prepayment speed assumption cumulative estimated fair value assuming adverse change  estimated fair value assuming adverse change  expected credit losses cumulative estimated fair value assuming adverse change  estimated fair value assuming adverse change  residual cash flows discount rate annual estimated fair value assuming adverse change  estimated fair value assuming adverse change  these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on and percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in this table  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption  in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  increases in market rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses  which could magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
c income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income and combined state franchise tax returns 
the company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company has estimated a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is not more than likely 
in determining the possible realization of deferred tax assets  future taxable income from the following sources are considered a the reversal of taxable temporary differences  b future operations exclusive of reversing temporary differences  and c tax planning strategies that  if necessary  would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into periods in which net operating losses might otherwise expire

mfn financial corporation acquisition mfn  through its primary operating subsidiary  mercury finance company llc  was in the business of purchasing contracts from dealers  and securitizing and servicing such contracts 
cps intends to continue to use the assets acquired in the merger in the automobile finance business  but a portion of such assets have been disposed of 
cps has ceased to use the acquired assets for the purchase of contracts  and does not anticipate recommencing such use 
in connection with the termination of mfn origination activities and the integration and consolidation of other activities  the company recognized as a liability its estimate of the costs to exit these activities and terminate the affected employees of mfn 
the terminated activities include service departments such as accounting  finance  human resources  information technology  administration  payroll and executive management 
the estimated costs include the following march  december  activity in thousands severance payments and consulting contracts   facilities closures   termination of contracts  leases  services and other obligations acquisition expenses accrued but unpaid total liabilities assumed    activity resulting in a net charge  includes charges against liability of million  and the reclassification of an existing accrual for offices closed prior to the merger date of approximately million 
approximately million of remaining accrual is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet of the company at december  the company believes that this amount provides adequately for anticipated remaining costs related to exiting certain activities of mfn  and that amounts indicated above are reasonably allocated 
upon effectiveness of the merger  each outstanding share of common stock of mfn converted into the right to receive per share in cash 
the total merger consideration payable to stockholders of mfn was approximately million 
the amount of such consideration was agreed to as the result of arms length negotiations between cps and mfn 
the aggregate purchase price  including expenses related to the transaction  was approximately million 
acquisition financing was provided to cps by westdeutsche landesbank girozentrale  new york branch westlb and levine leichtman capital partners ii  l 
p llcp 
cps obtained acquisition financing from llcp through its issuance and sale of certain senior secured notes to llcp in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the company s consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations as of and for the year ended december  include the results of operations of mfn for the period subsequent to march   the merger date 
the company has recorded certain purchase accounting adjustments recorded on its consolidated balance sheet  which are estimates based on available information 
in addition  the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  includes an extraordinary gain related to the excess of net assets acquired over purchase price negative goodwill totaling million 
results of operations the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
during the year ended december   revenues increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  net gain on sale of contracts decreased by million  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease in the gain on sale component of revenue is the termination of the company s flow purchase program in may  offset in part by an increase in the amount of contracts securitized by the company in compared to the company securitized million of contracts during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company sold million of contracts on a flow basis compared to million of contracts in the year ended december  gain on sale of contracts also includes the effect of fluctuations in the company s estimate of the required provision for losses on certain cps contracts and recovery of losses on such contracts 
during  recoveries exceeded the provision for losses  in the provision for losses was greater than recoveries 
during  the amount of contracts for which the company recorded a provision for contract losses has increased  requiring the company to provide for losses on such contracts in an amount exceeding related recoveries 
for the year ended december  the company recorded a million provision for contract losses  compared to a reduction of the provision for contract losses of million for the year ended december  also during  as a result of revised company estimates resulting from analyses of the current and historical performance of certain of the company s securitized pools  the company recorded a reduction to gain on sale of approximately million 
interest income increased million to million in the year ended december   from million in the prior year 
the increase in interest income is primarily due to the expansion of the company s servicing portfolio  primarily as a result of the mfn merger  as well as the addition of contracts to the cps portfolio and the related increase in the company s residual interest in securitizations as a result of the increased level of securitizations 
as of december   the servicing portfolio  net of unearned income on pre computed contracts  was million  compared to million as of december  servicing fees increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  servicing fees are composed of base fees  which are payable at the rate of per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding cps contracts on mfn contracts in the related trusts  plus any other fees collected by the company  such as late fees and returned check fees 
the increase in servicing fees is primarily due to the increase in the company s servicing portfolio 
expenses 
during the year ended december   operating expenses increased by million  or  to million  compared to the year ended december  operating expenses of million 
the company s operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and other operating expenses  which are incurred as applications and contracts are received  processed and serviced 
factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments  macroeconomic factors such as interest rates  and mix of business between contracts purchased on a flow basis and contracts purchased on an other than flow basis 
the overall increase in expenses is primarily attributable to the mfn merger 
personnel costs increased million  or  to million in from million in personnel costs include base salaries  commissions and bonuses paid to employees  and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options  and are the company s most significant operating expenses  representing approximately of operating expenses 
these costs generally fluctuate with the level of applications and contracts processed and serviced  with the mix of revenue and with overall portfolio performance 
other material operating expenses include facilities expenses  telephone and other communication services  credit services  computer services including personnel costs associated with information technology support  professional services  marketing and advertising expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
in connection with the termination of mfn origination activities and the integration and consolidation of certain activities see above  the company has recognized certain liabilities related to the costs to exit these activities and terminate the affected employees of mfn 
these activities include service departments such as accounting  finance  human resources  information technology  administration  payroll and executive management 
such exit and termination costs have been charged against these liabilities and are not reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the mfn merger and an increase in costs associated with servicing the company s expanded portfolio 
also included in general and administrative expenses is  related to the write off a related party receivable from carsusa  inc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense increased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the increase is due to the interest expense resulting from the mfn acquisition  including interest expense related to acquisition debt and the interest expense related to the notes payable to securitization trust 
see liquidity and capital resources 
marketing expenses decreased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in contracts purchased during the year ended december  occupancy expenses increased by  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the increase is primarily due to the addition of facilities acquired in the mfn merger 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the results for the years ended december  and  include net income of  and  respectively  from the company s subsidiary cps leasing  inc income tax benefit of million  including the elimination of the valuation allowance of million  was recorded in the period pursuant to relevant tax statutes and regulations 
the company s provision for income taxes was zero for the year ended december  the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
during the year ended december   revenues increased million  or  compared to the year ended december  net gain on sale of contracts increased by million  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in the gain on sale component of revenue is the company s securitization of approximately million of contracts in the period  resulting in a gain on sale of contracts of million 
the availability and structure of the company s note purchase facility enabled it to execute securitization sales during  no such sales occurred in the prior year 
in addition  the company completed a term securitization in september substantially all of the proceeds from the september transaction were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the company s floating rate variable note purchase facility 
additionally  gain on sale of contracts includes the effect of fluctuations in the company s estimate of the required provision for losses on contracts and in recoveries of losses on contracts 
during  recoveries exceeded the provision for losses  in the provision for losses was greater than recoveries 
the company makes recoveries on contracts previously held on balance sheet or from pools for which the company has exercised its optional right to repurchase receivables pursuant to the securitization agreements 
the amount of contracts for which the company requires a provision for contract losses has contracted  while the amount recovered increased 
as such the company is able to recover its provision for contract losses 
for the year ended december  the company recorded a reduction of the provision for contract losses of million  compared to a charge of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company sold million of contracts on a flow basis compared to million of contracts in the year ended december  the company s flow purchase program ended in may interest income increased million to million in the year ended december   from million in the prior year 
the increase in interest income is primarily due to the increase in residual interest income resulting from a change in the method residual interest income was calculated beginning in the second quarter of the increase in residual interest income is due to the company refining its methodology of calculation of such interest income beginning with the three month period ended june  the refined method is designed to accrete residual interest income on a level yield basis 
the company now uses an accretion rate that approximates the discount rate used to value the residual interest in securitizations  approximately per annum 
prior to such period  the company recognized residual interest income as the excess cash flows generated by the trusts over the related obligations of the trusts  net of any amortization of the related nirs 
this prior method of residual interest income recognition had approximated a level yield rate of residual interest income due to the continued addition of new securitizations 
since the company had not securitized any contracts since december  this prior method would not have reflected the appropriate level yield and thus was refined during the second quarter of the effect of this refinement has been offset  in part  by the contraction of the company s servicing portfolio 
servicing fees decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  servicing fees are composed of base fees  which are payable at the rate of to per annum on the principal balance of the outstanding contracts in the related trusts  plus any other fees collected by the company  such as late fees and returned check fees 
the decrease in servicing fees is primarily due to the decrease in the company s servicing portfolio 
as of december   the servicing portfolio  net of unearned income on pre computed contracts  was million  compared to million as of december  expenses 
during the year ended december   operating expenses decreased by million  or  compared to the year ended december  personnel costs were effectively flat year over year  decreasing  or  to million in from million in personnel costs include base salaries  commissions and bonuses paid to employees  and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options  and are the company s most significant operating expenses  representing approximately of total operating expenses 
these costs generally fluctuate with the level of applications and contracts processed and serviced  with the mix of revenue and with overall portfolio performance 
other material operating expenses include facilities expenses  telephone and other communication services  credit services  computer services including personnel costs associated with information technology support  professional services  marketing and advertising expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the decrease in costs associated with servicing the company s diminished portfolio 
interest expense decreased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the reductions in non warehouse indebtedness from the prior year 
see liquidity and capital resources 
marketing expenses increased by  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the increase is primarily due to the increase in contracts purchased during the year ended december  occupancy expenses decreased by  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease is primarily due to additional property taxes paid during  not due in in november  the company moved its headquarters to a new  square foot facility 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the results for the years ended december  and  include net earnings of  and  respectively  from the company s subsidiary cps leasing  inc the increase in net income of cps leasing  inc 
is primarily attributable to the decision to cease lease receivable origination and to simply service the existing receivables  resulting in significant expense reductions 
the results for the year ended december   include net operating losses of  from the company s investment in of nab asset corp 
the company s effective tax rate was zero and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company s business requires substantial cash to support its purchases of contracts and other operating activities 
the company s primary sources of cash have been cash flows from operating activities  including proceeds from sales of contracts  amounts borrowed under various revolving credit facilities also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities  servicing fees on portfolios of contracts previously sold  customer payments of principal and interest on contracts held for sale  fees for origination of contracts  and releases of cash from credit enhancements provided by the company for the financial guaranty insurers note insurers and investors  initially made in the form of a cash deposit to an account spread account  and releases of cash from securitized pools of contracts in which the company has retained a residual ownership interest 
the company s primary uses of cash have been the purchases of contracts  repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit and otherwise  operating expenses such as employee  interest  occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses  the establishment of and further contributions to spread accounts cash posted to enhance credit of securitized pools  and income taxes 
there can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet the company s cash demands 
the sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools which determines the level of releases from spread accounts  the rate of expansion or contraction in the company s servicing portfolio  and the terms upon which the company is able to acquire  sell  and borrow against contracts 
net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
cash from operating activities is generally provided by the net releases from the company s securitization trusts and from the amortization and liquidation of contracts 
such amortization and liquidation of contracts increased in compared to prior years as a result of the mfn merger and the addition of contracts to the cps servicing portfolio and related increase in securitization transactions 
on march   the company completed the mfn merger see note of notes to consolidated financial statements the acquisition cost was approximately million  and was substantially funded by existing cash and borrowings 
cash flows from the underlying purchased assets are expected to provide adequate liquidity to fund the acquisition borrowings  as well as generate positive cash flows from which to fund the company s operating activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and  was million   and  respectively 
cash used in the acquisition of mfn financial corporation  net of the cash acquired in the transaction  totaled million 
net cash used in financing activities for the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
in connection with the acquisition of mfn financial corporation the company incurred debt related to the mfn a securitization trust see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
and additional senior secured debt see note of notes to consolidated financial statements cash used in financing activities is primarily attributable to the repayment of outstanding debt 
in connection with the mfn merger the amount of outstanding debt  securitization trust debt and senior secured debt  and the required repayment thereof  increased compared to prior years 
the company believes that cash flows generated as a result of the acquisition of mfn financial corporation will be sufficient to meet the obligations incurred as a result of the merger 
there can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet such cash demands 
the sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of the securitized pools 
at the time of the merger  mfn had outstanding million in principal amount of senior subordinated debt  which was due and repaid in full on march  such debt bore interest at the rate of per annum  payable quarterly in arrears 
contracts are purchased from dealers for a cash price approximating their principal amount  and generate cash flow over a period of years 
as a result  the company has been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase contracts  and on the availability of cash from outside sources in order to finance its continuing operations  as well as to fund the portion of contract purchase prices not financed under warehouse credit facilities 
during and through may  the company s contract purchasing program consisted of both i purchases for the company s own account made on other than a flow basis  funded primarily by advances under a revolving warehouse credit facility  and ii flow purchases for immediate resale to non affiliates 
flow purchases allowed the company to purchase contracts with minimal demands on liquidity 
the company s revenues from the resale of flow purchase contracts  however  were materially less than those that may be received by holding contracts to maturity or by selling contracts in securitization transactions 
during the year ended december   the company purchased million of contracts on a flow basis  and million on an other than flow basis for its own account  compared to million and million  respectively  of contracts purchased in for the year ended december   the company purchased million of contracts on a flow basis and million on an other than flow basis 
the company s flow purchase program ended in may during the years ended december  and  the company purchased contracts to for resale into securitization transactions 
the company did not sell contracts in a securitization transaction during or  however  since november  the company has been able to purchase contracts for its own account  which are generally resold into a term securitization transaction  using proceeds from two warehouse lines of credit 
these warehouse lines of credit consist of a million floating rate variable funding note facility  and a million floating rate variable funding note facility 
these facilities are independent of each other  and are funded and insured by different institutions 
approximately and  respectively  of the principal balance of contracts may be advanced to the company under these facilities  subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants 
the million warehouse facility is structured to allow cps to fund a portion of the purchase price of contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by cps warehouse trust 
this facility was established in march   in the maximum amount of million 
such maximum amount was increased to million in november approximately of the principal balance of contracts may be advanced to the company under this facility  subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants 
notes under this facility bear interest at a rate of one month commercial paper plus per annum 
this facility was renewed on march  the million warehouse facility is structured to allow cps to fund a portion of the purchase price of contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by cps funding llc 
approximately of the principal balance of contracts may be advanced to the company under this facility subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants  notes under this facility bear interest at a rate of one month libor plus per annum 
these facilities are independent of each other  and are funded and insured by different institutions 
sales of contracts to the facility related special purpose subsidiaries sps are treated as ongoing securitizations 
the company  therefore  removes the securitized contracts and related debt from its consolidated balance sheet and recognizes a gain on sale in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company securitized million of contracts during the year ending december   resulting in a gain on sale of million  compared to million of contracts securitized during the year ending december   resulting in a gain on sale of million 
the company completed a million term securitization through its subsidiary  cps receivables corp 
on september   retaining a residual interest therein 
in a private placement  qualified institutional buyers purchased notes backed by automotive receivables 
the notes  issued by cps auto receivables trust a  consist of two classes million of class a notes  and million of class a notes 
the company completed an additional securitization through its subsidiary  cps receivables corp 
on march   retaining a residual interest therein 
in that transaction  million of notes backed by automotive receivables were issued in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers by cps auto receivables trust a

the proceeds from the august and the december transaction were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the cps warehouse trust floating rate variable note purchase facility and for general corporate purposes 
the company previously purchased contracts on a flow basis  which  as compared with purchases of contracts for the company s own account  involved a materially reduced demand on the company s cash 
the company s plan for meeting its liquidity needs is to match its levels of contract purchases to its availability of cash 
cash used for subsequent deposits to spread accounts for the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
cash released from spread accounts to the company for the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
changes in deposits to and releases from spread accounts are affected by the relative size  seasoning and performance of the various pools of contracts sold that make up the company s servicing portfolio to which the respective spread accounts are related 
during the year ended december  the company made initial deposits to the related spread accounts of million related to its term securitization transactions  compared to million in the period 
no such initial deposits were made in  as there were no securitizations during that year 
the acquisition of contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions  and the need to fund spread accounts when those transactions take place  results in a continuing need for capital 
the amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the company s contract purchases other than flow purchases  the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations  and the extent to which the previously established spread accounts either release cash to the company or capture cash from collections on sold contracts 
the company is currently limited in its ability to purchase contracts due to certain liquidity constraints 
as of december   the company had cash on hand of million and available contract purchase commitments from its warehouse credit facilities of million 
the company received an additional contract purchase commitment from its cps funding llc warehouse credit facility of million upon closing in january the company s plans to manage the need for liquidity include the completion of additional term securitizations that would provide additional credit availability from the warehouse credit facilities  and matching its levels of contract purchases to its availability of cash 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the term securitizations on favorable economic terms or that the company will be able to complete term securitizations at all 
if the company is unable to complete such securitizations  servicing fees and other portfolio related income would decrease 
the company s ability to adjust the quantity of contracts that it purchases and sells will be subject to general competitive conditions and the continued availability of the floating rate variable note purchase facilities 
there can be no assurance that the desired level of contract acquisition can be maintained or increased 
obtaining releases of cash from the spread accounts is dependent on collections from the related trusts generating sufficient cash to maintain the spread accounts in excess of the amended specified levels 
there can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will generate cash in excess of the amended specified levels 
certain of the company s securitization transactions and the cps warehouse trust floating rate variable note purchase facility contain various covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results 
the company was in compliance with these covenants as of the date of this report 
credit facilities the terms on which credit has been available to the company for purchase of contracts have varied over the three year period ended december   as shown in the following recapitulation in november  the company through its subsidiary cps funding llc entered into a floating rate variable note purchase facility under which up to million of notes may be outstanding at any time subject to collateral tests and other conditions 
the company uses funds derived from this facility to purchase contracts  which are pledged to secure the notes 
the collateral tests and other conditions generally allow the company to borrow up to approximately of the price paid for such contracts 
notes issued under this facility bear interest at one month libor plus per annum 
the balance of notes outstanding related to this facility at december  was zero 
this facility was renewed and restated in january additionally  in march  the company through its subsidiary cps warehouse trust entered in to a second floating rate variable note purchase facility  under which up to million of notes may be outstanding at any time  subject to collateral tests and other conditions

the acquisition of contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions  and the need to fund spread accounts when those transactions take place  results in a continuing need for capital 
the amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the company s contract purchases other than purchases made on a flow basis  the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations  and the extent to which the spread accounts either release cash to the company or capture cash from collections on sold contracts 
the company plans to adjust its levels of contract purchases so as to match anticipated releases of cash from spread accounts with its capital requirements

forward looking statements this report on form k includes certain forward looking statements  including  without limitation  the statements or implications to the effect that i gross losses as a percentage of original balances will approximate to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts  with recovery rates approximating to of original principal balances  ii that the company believes it will achieve operating expense savings or synergies in connection with the merger  and iii that management anticipates that the company will earn taxable income during the current year 
other forward looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as anticipates  expects  plans  estimates  or words of like meaning 
as to the specifically identified forward looking statements  factors that could affect gross losses and recovery rates include changes in the general economic climate  which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts  changes in laws respecting consumer finance  which could affect the ability of the company to enforce rights under contracts  and changes in the market for used vehicles  which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles 
factors that could affect operating expense savings include the ability of company staff to perform tasks previously performed by others  and the real estate markets in regions in which the company may close facilities 
factors that could affect the company s revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of contracts  which would affect the company s ability to purchase contracts  the terms on which the company is able to finance such purchases  the willingness of dealers to sell contracts to the company on the terms that it offers  and the terms on which the company is able to sell contracts once acquired 
factors that could affect the company s expenses in the current year include those that affect its ability to achieve expense savings  identified above  competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel  and interest rates which affect the rates that the company pays on notes issued in its securitizations 
additional risk factors  any of which could have a material effect on the company s performance  are set forth below dependence on warehouse financing 
the company s primary source of day to day liquidity is continuous securitization of contracts  under which it sells contracts to a special purpose subsidiary as often as once a week 
such transactions function as a warehouse  in which contracts are held pending their future sale into a term securitization 
the company expects to continue to effect similar transactions or to obtain replacement or additional financing as current arrangements expire or become fully utilized  however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtainable on favorable terms 
to the extent that the company is unable to maintain its existing structure or is unable to arrange new warehouse facilities  the company may have to curtail contract purchasing activities  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on securitization program 
the company is dependent upon its ability to continue to pool and sell contracts in term securitizations in order to generate cash proceeds for new purchases 
adverse changes in the market for securitized contract pools  or a substantial lengthening of the warehousing period  would burden the company s financing capabilities  could require the company to curtail its purchase of contracts  and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  as a means of reducing the percentage of cash collateral that the company would otherwise be required to deposit and maintain in spread accounts  all of the company s securitizations since june have utilized credit enhancement in the form of financial guaranty insurance policies issued by monoline financial guaranty insurers 
the company believes that financial guaranty insurance policies reduce the costs of securitizations relative to alternative forms of credit enhancements available to the company 
no insurer is required to insure company sponsored securitizations and there can be no assurance that any will continue to do so 
similarly  there can be no assurance that any securitization transaction will be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
the timing of any securitization transaction is affected by a number of factors beyond the company s control  any of which could cause substantial delays  including  without limitation  market conditions and the approval by all parties of the terms of the securitization 
risk of general economic downturn 
the company s business is directly related to sales of new and used automobiles  which are affected by employment rates  prevailing interest rates and other domestic economic conditions 
delinquencies  foreclosures and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions 
because of the company s focus on sub prime customers  the actual rates of delinquencies  repossessions and losses on such contracts could be higher under adverse economic conditions than those experienced in the automobile finance industry in general 
any sustained period of economic slowdown or recession could adversely affect the company s ability to sell or securitize pools of contracts 
the timing of any economic changes is uncertain  and sluggish sales of automobiles and weakness in the economy could have an adverse effect on the company s business and that of the dealers from which it purchases contracts 
dependence on performance of sold contracts 
under the financial structures the company has used to date in its term securitizations  certain excess servicing cash flows generated by the contracts sold in the term securitizations are retained in a spread account within the securitization trusts to provide liquidity and credit enhancement 
while the specific terms and mechanics of the spread account vary among transactions  the company s securitization agreements generally provide that the company will receive excess cash flows only if the spread account balances have reached specified levels and or the delinquency or losses related to the contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels 
in the event delinquencies and losses on the contracts exceed such levels  the terms of the securitization may require increased spread account balances to be accumulated for the particular pool  may restrict the distribution to the company of excess cash flows associated with other pools  or  in certain circumstances  may permit the insurers to require the transfer of servicing on some or all of the contracts to another servicer 
any of these conditions could materially adversely affect the company s liquidity and financial condition 
creditworthiness of consumers 
the company specializes in the purchase  sale and servicing of contracts to finance automobile purchases by sub prime customers  which entail a higher risk of non performance  higher delinquencies and higher losses than contracts with more creditworthy customers 
while the company believes that the underwriting criteria and collection methods it employs enable it to control the higher risks inherent in contracts with sub prime customers  no assurance can be given that such criteria and methods will afford adequate protection against such risks 
the company has experienced fluctuations in the delinquency and charge off performance of its contracts 
in the event that portfolios of contracts sold and serviced by the company experience greater defaults  higher delinquencies or higher losses than anticipated  the company s income could be negatively affected 
a larger number of defaults than anticipated could also result in adverse changes in the structure of the company s future securitization transactions  such as a requirement of increased cash collateral in such transactions 
possible increase in cost of funds 
the company s profitability is determined by  among other things  the difference between the rate of interest charged on the contracts purchased by the company and the rate of interest payable to purchasers of notes issued in securitizations 
the contracts purchased by the company generally bear finance charges close to or at the maximum permitted by applicable state law 
the interest rates payable on such notes the company are fixed  based on interest rates prevailing in the market at the time of sale 
consequently  increases in market interest rates tend to reduce the spread or margin between contract finance charges and the interest rates required by investors and  thus  the potential operating profits to the company from the purchase  sale and servicing of contracts 
operating profits expected to be earned by the company on portfolios of contracts previously sold are insulated from the adverse effects of increasing interest rates because the interest rates on the related notes were fixed at the time the contracts were sold 
any future increases in interest rates would likely increase the interest rates on notes issued in future term securitizations and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
prepayment and default risk 
gains from the sale of contracts in the company s past securitization transactions have constituted a significant portion of the net income of the company and are likely to continue to represent a significant portion of the company s net income 
a portion of the gains is based in part on management s estimates of future prepayment and default rates and other considerations in light of then current conditions 
if actual prepayments with respect to contracts occur more quickly than was projected at the time such contracts were sold  as can occur when interest rates decline  or if default rates are greater than projected at the time such contracts were sold  a charge to income may be required and would be taken in the period of adjustment 
if actual prepayments occur more slowly or if default rates are lower than estimated with respect to contracts sold  total revenue would exceed previously estimated amounts 
competition 
the automobile financing business is highly competitive 
the company competes with a number of national  local and regional finance companies 
in addition  competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies  such as commercial banks  savings and loan associations  leasing companies  credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers such as general motors acceptance corporation  ford motor credit corporation  chrysler financial corporation and nissan motors acceptance corporation 
many of the company s competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial  marketing  technical  personnel and other resources than the company 
moreover  the company s future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of its capital relative to that of its competitors 
the company s competitors and potential competitors include far larger  more established companies that have access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade rated debt instruments  and to other funding sources which may be unavailable to the company 
many of these companies also have long standing relationships with dealers and may provide other financing to dealers  including floor plan financing for the dealers purchases of automobiles from manufacturers  which is not offered by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully 
litigation 
because of the consumer oriented nature of the industry in which the company operates and the application of certain laws and regulations  industry participants are regularly named as defendants in class action litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts  including fraud 
many of these actions involve alleged violations of consumer protection laws 
although the company is not involved in any material litigation  a significant judgment against the company or within the industry in connection with any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on dealers 
the company is dependent upon establishing and maintaining relationships with unaffiliated dealers to supply it with contracts 
during the year ended december   no dealer accounted for more than of the contracts purchased by the company 
the dealer agreements do not require dealers to submit a minimum number of contracts for purchase by the company 
the failure of dealers to submit contracts that meet the company s underwriting criteria would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
government regulations 
the company s business is subject to numerous federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations  which  among other things i require the company to obtain and maintain certain licenses and qualifications  ii limit the interest rates  fees and other charges the company is allowed to charge  iii limit or prescribe certain other terms of its contracts  iv require the company to provide specified disclosures  and v regulate certain servicing and collection practices and define its rights to repossess and sell collateral 
an adverse change in existing laws or regulations  or in the interpretation thereof  the promulgation of any additional laws or regulations  or the failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements the company will adopt in future periods new accounting pronouncements 
for information on how adoption has affected and will affect the financial statements  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk although the company utilized its floating rate variable note purchase facility and completed term securitizations during the year ended december   the structures did not lend themselves to some of the strategies the company has used in the past to minimize interest rate risk  as described below 
specifically  the rate on the notes issued by the floating rate variable note purchase facility is adjustable and there is no pre funding component to the floating rate variable note purchase facility or term securitization 
the company does intend to issue fixed rate notes and to include pre funding structures for future term securitization transactions  whereby the amount of asset backed securities issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts 
in pre funding  the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an escrow account until the company sells the additional contracts to the trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre funded escrow account 
in pre funded securitizations  the company locks in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts it subsequently delivers to the trust 
however  the company incurs an expense in pre funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the asset backed securities outstanding  the amount as to which there can be no assurance 
in addition  the contracts the company does purchase and securitize have fixed rates of interest  whereas the company s interest expense related to the current note purchase facility is based on a variable rate 
historically  the company s term securitization facilities had fixed rates of interest 
therefore  some of the strategies the company has used in the past to minimize interest rate risk do not currently apply 
the company is subject to market risks due to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through its outstanding indebtedness and to a lesser extent its outstanding interest earning assets  and commitments to enter into new contracts 
the table below outlines the carrying values and estimated fair values of such financial instruments december  carrying fair carrying fair financial instrument value value value value in thousands finance receivables  net   notes payable   securitization trust debt   senior secured debt     subordinated debt     related party debt     much of the information used to determine fair value is highly subjective 
when applicable  readily available market information has been utilized 
however  for a significant portion of the company s financial instruments  active markets do not exist 
therefore  considerable judgments were required in estimating fair value for certain items 
the subjective factors include  among other things  the estimated timing and amount of cash flows  risk characteristics  credit quality and interest rates  all of which are subject to change 
since the fair value is estimated and do not reflect amounts of which amounts outstanding could be settled by the company  the amounts that will actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different
