item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion together with pall s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k report 
the discussions under the subheadings review of market segment and geographies below are in local currency unless indicated otherwise 
as used below  indicates that we have rounded the relevant data up or down to the nearest one half percentage point 
dollar amounts discussed below are in thousands  except per share dollar amounts 
in addition  per share dollar amounts are discussed on a diluted basis 
acquisition and related matters on april   the company acquired the filtration and separations group fsg from united states filter corporation us filter for  in cash  subject to a post closing adjustment of the purchase price based on the net assets acquired as of april  the adjustment to the purchase price was finalized in the first quarter of fiscal  resulting in additional consideration due to us filter of  the operating results of fsg are reported in the company s results of operations from april  the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that the total cost of the acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
the allocation of the purchase price was dependent upon certain valuations and other studies 
the methodology for allocating the purchase price to the estimated fair value of in process research and development  as well as patented and unpatented technology was determined with the assistance of the mentor group  a third party valuation firm 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the valuation of in process research and development and certain amortizable intangible assets  patented and unpatented technology  was finalized 
as a result  the company wrote off  of preliminary goodwill as in process research and development refer to the restructuring and other charges note accompanying the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and reallocated  of preliminary goodwill to write up the aforementioned amortizable intangible assets from their book value to their fair value of  the amount of in process research and development was determined by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and for which no alternative future uses existed 
as of the acquisition date  there were various projects that met the above criteria 
the majority of the projects identified are targeted for the general industrial segment 
the value of the research projects identified to be in process was determined by estimating the future cash flows from the projects once commercially feasible  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value 
the key assumptions specifically underlying the valuation for purchased in process research and development consist of an expected completion date for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  revenue and expense projections  and discount rates based on the risks associated with the development life cycle of the in process technology acquired 
the weighted average discount rate used was approximately ranging from to 
the percentage of completion for the projects was determined using milestones representing estimates of effort  value added and degree of difficulty of the portion of the projects completed as of april   as compared with the total research and development to be completed to bring the projects to technological feasibility 
as of may   the company estimates the projects were approximately complete on a weighted average basis ranging from to 
the development of these technologies remains an uncertainty due to the remaining efforts to achieve technological feasibility  changing customer markets  and significant competitive threats from other companies 
at the date of acquisition  management began formulating integration plans  which contemplated the closure of redundant facilities and the sale of certain businesses 
in addition  the synergies created by joining the two organizations have resulted in employee terminations 
the consolidated balance sheets at august  and august  reflect liabilities for such items refer to the restructuring and other charges note accompanying the consolidated financial statements for discussion of these items 
we expect to continue to finalize and announce other integration plans during fiscal finalization of such integration plans will be reflected in earnings 
for more detail regarding the fsg acquisition  please refer to the acquisitions note accompanying the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from estimates 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and that require judgment 
see also the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies 
purchase accounting and goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with sfas no 
is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
there are various methods used to estimate the value of tangible and intangible assets acquired  such as discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables  and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to comparables 
there are also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
the company performs goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  the company could be required to strategically realign its resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
based on impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal and revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when contractual terms have been fulfilled 
long term contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete them 
the cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change  including anticipated losses 
such revisions could result in a material adjustment in the period of the change 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when collection becomes doubtful 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  management reserves an amount believed to be uncollectible 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost principally on the first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon assumptions about historic usage  future demand and market conditions 
these adjustments are estimates which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
recoverability of available for sale investments other than temporary losses relating to available for sale investments are recognized in earnings when management determines that the recoverability of the cost of the investment is unlikely 
such losses could result in a material adjustment in the period of the change 
the company considers numerous factors  on a case by case basis  in evaluating whether the decline in market value of an available for sale security below cost is other than temporary 
such factors include  but are not limited to  i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer of the investment  and iii whether the company s intent to retain the investment for the period of time is sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
pension plans the company sponsors pension plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience in the short term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
pension expense associated with our defined benefit plans was  in fiscal  which was based on a weighted average discount rate of calculated using the projected benefit obligation and a weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets of calculated using the fair value of plan assets 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
if the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by basis points  projected pension expense in would have increased approximately  the discount rates used for defined benefit plans are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better 
if the weighted average discount rate was reduced by basis points  pension expense in would have increased by approximately  accrued expenses the company estimates certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
the most material accrued estimates relate to environmental proceedings and insurance related expenses  including self insurance 
environmental accruals are recorded based upon historical costs incurred and estimates for future costs of remediation and on going legal expenses 
workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on insurance claims processed including applied loss development factors 
employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on medical claims processed as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such a determination is made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
we provide for united states income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered permanently invested outside the united states 
at august   the cumulative earnings upon which united states income taxes have not been provided are  if these earnings were repatriated to the united states  they would generate foreign tax credits that could reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend  however  a determination of any residual us tax on such repatriation is not practicable 
results of operations compared with review of consolidated results sales for the fiscal year increased to  from  in fiscal year exchange rates increased reported sales in the year by  or  primarily due to the strengthening of the euro and to a lesser extent the british pound and japanese yen  partly offset by the weakening of the argentine peso 
in local currency ie  had exchange rates not changed year over year  sales increased 
overall  pricing had a positive impact on sales  contributing to our top line growth 
for a detailed discussion of sales  refer to review of market segments and geographies 
compared with last year s pro forma sales which include fsg s sales for the nine months ended march   sales increased with all segments contributing to this gain 
growth was particularly strong in aerospace which did not benefit from the fsg acquisition  microelectronics and biopharmaceuticals 
the pro forma sales growth is provided to give an indication of what comparable sales growth would have been had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of fiscal however  it is not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred if the acquisition had been consummated at that date due to many factors 
these factors include different market approaches and routes to market eg  direct sales versus distribution  product rationalization and pricing 
cost of sales in fiscal  as a percentage of sales  was as compared with in fiscal the year over year comparison of cost of sales reflects the benefit of foreign exchange partly offset by the effect of fsg product margins 
over time  we expect fsg s margins to improve to levels comparable with pall s historical margins 
in addition  the year over year comparison reflects the inclusion of a one time purchase accounting adjustment of  in fiscal we consider this item to be non recurring in nature because  although we acquired the manufacturing operations of fsg  this adjustment was required by sfas no 
as an elimination of the manufacturing profit of inventory acquired from fsg and sold in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal declined 
to from in fiscal the percentage improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects synergies achieved related to our fsg integration efforts and the effects of our cost reduction programs  offset by the impact of increased bonus  pension  consulting and insurance costs see next paragraph  foreign exchange estimated to have increased selling  general and administrative expenses by about  for the year and expenses related to the integration of fsg 
we have identified  in annualized cost synergies that we expect to realize by the end of fiscal year as a result of our integration of fsg 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we achieved the run rate to accomplish this objective 
we are continuing to evaluate other potential cost savings as well 
in fiscal  pension costs increased approximately  excluding increases related to fsg pension due to the downturn in the equities market and decreased interest rates 
in addition  insurance premiums increased approximately  in fiscal  items such as pension  insurance and medical costs are expected to increase approximately  above the fiscal levels 
the company s cost reduction initiatives are expected to offset these cost increases 
research and development r d expenses declined to of sales from in fiscal  reflecting the elimination of shared research costs with vi technologies vitex  partly offset by the impact of fsg s r d 
as a result of the modification of our partnership agreement to eliminate shared research costs  the fourth quarter of fiscal included our final r d payment to vitex 
in fiscal  we recorded restructuring and other charges of  reflecting the write off of in process research and development acquired in the fsg acquisition of  severance costs of  asset write offs of  and other exit costs of  the fiscal charges were primarily related to the fsg acquisition and the realignment of our life sciences business refer to the segment information and geographies note accompanying the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the reorganization of our life sciences business including the transfer of medical manufacturing from ireland which is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of this calendar year 
in fiscal  we recorded restructuring  other charges and adjustments of  reflecting severance costs of  asset write offs of and other exit costs of  a one time purchase accounting adjustment of  included in cost of sales  an addition of  to a previously established environmental remediation reserve and a  write down of two strategic investments 
the following table summarizes the activity for the year ended august  related to restructuring liabilities that were recorded in fiscal and fiscal severance lease termination liabilities other total severance lease termination liabilities other total balance at aug 
 additions a utilized balance at aug  a additions reflect items charged to earnings and items recorded as adjustments to goodwill 
the details of the charges for fiscal and fiscal can be found in the restructuring and other charges note accompanying the consolidated financial statements 
we expect to recover the costs of the restructuring related charges within two years from the date of the charge 
net interest expense increased  in fiscal as compared with fiscal reflecting increased borrowings during the first nine months of fiscal to fund the fsg acquisition partly offset by the effect of our receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swaps 
refer to the liquidity and capital resources section of the management s discussion and analysis as well as the financial instruments and risks and uncertainties note accompanying the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our interest rate swaps 
in fiscal  the tax rate was due to the non deductibility of the in process research and development charge taken in the first quarter 
the underlying effective tax rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal the improvement in the underlying effective rate in fiscal was a result of fine tuning our tax planning strategies in the first quarter of fiscal we expect our tax rate to increase to in fiscal as earnings increase in higher tax rate jurisdictions 
net earnings in fiscal were  or cents per share  compared with net earnings of  or cents per share in fiscal in summary  net earnings in fiscal benefited from organic sales growth  the impact of the fsg acquisition  the controlling of expenses and the benefit of foreign exchange rates  partly offset by the effect of lower margins on sales of fsg products  restructuring and other charges and increased interest costs related to borrowings to fund the fsg acquisition 
due to the difficulty in estimating the economic effect of foreign currency rates  particularly in periods of high volatility of such rates  we no longer provide such estimated effects and report only the translation effect to earnings per share 
we estimate that foreign exchange translation added cents to earnings per share for the year 
review of market segments and geographies market segments the table below presents sales by market segment with the prior period restated to reflect the life sciences reorganization as discussed in the segment information and geographies note accompanying the consolidated financial statements  including the effect of exchange rates for comparative purposes 
fiscal fiscal change exchange rate difference change in local currency medical biopharmaceuticals total life sciences general industrial aerospace microelectronics total industrial total the table below presents estimated pro forma sales growth  based upon an estimate of fsg sales in each of our segments for the nine months ended march  for comparative purposes 
the pro forma sales growth is provided to give an indication of what comparable sales growth would have been had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of fiscal however  it is not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred if the acquisition had been consummated at that date due to many factors 
these factors include different market approaches and routes to market eg  direct sales versus distribution  product rationalization and pricing 
fiscal fiscal pro forma change exchange rate difference change in local currency medical biopharmaceuticals total life sciences general industrial aerospace microelectronics total industrial total life sciences sales increased as compared with last year 
on a pro forma basis to include fsg  sales grew 
life sciences represented approximately of our total sales in fiscal as compared with approximately last year 
within life sciences  medical segment sales declined reflecting a decrease in blood sales of partly offset by an increase in critical care of 
the decline in blood sales was primarily due to a decrease in the level of blood donations as compared with last year 
by geography  medical sales in the western hemisphere and europe were down  while sales in asia were flat 
in fiscal  we expect sales in our medical segment to grow in the mid single digit range as sales of new products  such as the bacteria detection system  offset the reduction in blood donations in the us we are also well positioned for the renewal of existing multi year agreements in the western hemisphere that primarily expire in june and for the next round of european tenders ie  bids for blood products 
there is also upside potential in asia  as the japan ministry of health and the japanese red cross are expediting a policy shift to universal leukocyte reduction of blood platelets by april biopharmaceuticals segment sales grew as compared with last year 
sales on a pro forma basis grew 
growth in biopharmaceuticals was attributable to our pharmaceutical sub market where sales increased compared with last year 
this sub market has benefited from the increased production in the biotechnology industry  which is driving growth 
all geographies reported strong growth in the pharmaceuticals sub market 
in biosciences  the other sub market in our biopharmaceuticals segment  sales were down reflecting a major change from direct sales to distributors 
in addition  sales were down in the specialty materials part of our biosciences business 
we expect to see renewed growth in specialty materials in early fiscal by geography  the decline in biosciences reflects shortfalls in europe and the western hemisphere 
in asia  biosciences sales increased 
in fiscal  we expect double digit sales growth in biopharmaceuticals with some upside potential if the pace of biotechnology drug approvals picks up 
our industrial business  where the majority of fsg s sales are reported  accounted for approximately of total sales in fiscal as compared with last year 
industrial sales grew as compared with fiscal primarily due to the acquisition of fsg 
sales on a pro forma basis increased reflecting strong growth in aerospace and microelectronics 
general industrial segment sales  which are the largest portion of our industrial business  grew with all geographies contributing to this gain 
all sub markets within general industrial reported strong sales growth compared with last year 
on a pro forma basis  general industrial sales were down 
within general industrial  sales in our water processing sub market increased reflecting our continued successful pilot testing at municipal sites and our market penetration in eastern europe and asia 
process enhancements in this sub market continue to help us gain market share 
sales in our food beverage sub market grew as the integration of fsg technologies and expertise has significantly broadened our breadth and reach 
all geographies contributed to this gain 
growth in europe and asia reflects the impact of the emerging beer markets in eastern europe and china 
sales in our fuels chemicals sub market grew 
strategic partnerships are creating excellent growth opportunities in this market and a key growth driver continues to be clean fuels and synthetic fuels initiatives based on environmental driven regulations 
sales in our machinery equipment sub market grew  despite difficult industry conditions  with all geographies contributing to this gain 
sales in our power generation sub market increased 
power generation sales growth was strong in europe and asia 
in the western hemisphere  power generation sales were down as there has been some weakening in the oem turbine market 
in fiscal  we expect sales in our general industrial business to grow in the mid single digit range 
aerospace sales grew  reflecting strong military sales 
military sales  which were boosted by the middle east conflict  grew year over year 
all geographies contributed to the growth in military sales 
commercial sales were flat for the year as growth in europe and asia was offset by a decline in the western hemisphere 
the commercial side of the business is still suffering from lower air traffic  although cabin air sales were strong due to sars 
military sales comprised approximately of total aerospace sales in fiscal as compared with last year 
we estimate that the middle east conflict boosted sales in this segment by approximately million in fiscal  most of which is unlikely to repeat next year 
as such  we expect sales to be down in the low single digits in fiscal given the difficult comparison to the strong sales in fiscal microelectronics sales grew as compared with last year 
on a pro forma basis  sales increased 
the growth year over year was achieved in spite of the fact that the semiconductor oem market remains weak globally and we only have just started to see a slight rebound 
all geographies reported double digit sales growth year over year 
we are achieving growth in the photolithography materials and data storage markets and we have been executing our strategy of providing integrated solutions for the filtration  purification and waste minimization applications affecting microelectronics manufacturing 
assuming a modest upswing in the semi conductor market  we expect mid single digit sales growth in fiscal the consolidated operating profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal increased to from last year 
in life sciences  overall operating profit improved to from reflecting an improvement in medical operating profit margins partly offset by a decline in biopharmaceuticals 
within life sciences  medical operating profit improved to from last year  while operating profit dollars increased by  or 
the improvements in operating profit reflect manufacturing based cost reduction programs  synergies realized as a result of the reorganization of the critical care and blood businesses refer to the restructuring and other charges note accompanying the consolidated financial statements for discussion of actions taken in fiscal and the elimination of our r d cost sharing with vitex 
operating profit in biopharmaceuticals declined to from last year 
the decrease in margin for the year was primarily related to a change in product mix 
fsg s sales  which carry a lower gross margin  also contributed to the decline 
overall we expect biopharmaceuticals margins to fluctuate within a range of based on the sales mix 
operating profit dollars in biopharmaceuticals increased  or  despite the decline in margin  reflecting strong pharmaceutical sales growth 
overall operating profit margins in industrial improved to from last year 
general industrial operating profit improved slightly to from last year 
operating profit dollars increased significantly by  or  reflecting strong sales growth  which was driven by the acquisition of fsg 
the improvement in general industrial operating profit margin reflects a change in product mix and cost reductions partly offset by the addition of fsg products  which carry lower margins 
aerospace operating profit improved to from  while operating profit dollars grew  or  primarily attributable to strong military sales 
microelectronics operating profit improved to from last year  while operating profit dollars increased  or driven by strong sales growth 
the table below presents fiscal sales to unaffiliated customers by geography compared with fiscal sales  including the effect of exchange rates 
in addition  the table provides the estimated impact fsg had on our reported fiscal sales 
the discussions of sales growth below are in local currency unless indicated otherwise 
fiscal fiscal change exchange rate difference change in local currency western hemisphere europe asia total by geography  sales in the western hemisphere increased on both a reported and local currency basis  as compared with fiscal exchange rates reduced sales by  primarily related to the weakening of the argentine peso 
operating profit improved to of sales from last year 
the increase in operating profit in the western hemisphere reflects the improvements in margins achieved in our various business segments as noted above 
in europe  sales increased compared with last year 
the strengthening of european currencies added  in sales  resulting in reported sales growth of 
operating profit improved to from last year  reflecting the segment operating margin improvements cited above 
in addition  strong sales growth  particularly in higher margin business such as aerospace and biopharmaceuticals contributed to the improvement in operating profit margin 
sales in asia increased 
the strengthening of asian currencies added  in sales  resulting in reported sales growth of 
operating profit increased to from last year  reflecting the segment operating profit improvements cited above as well as strong sales growth  particularly in higher margin business such as biopharmaceuticals 
general corporate expenses increased  compared with fiscal  reflecting increased bonus  pension  consulting and insurance costs partly offset by savings achieved as a result of our cost reduction program 
results of operations compared with review of consolidated results sales for fiscal were  as compared with  in fiscal exchange rates reduced reported sales for the year by  or  primarily due to the weakness of the yen and to a lesser extent the argentine peso  partly offset by the strengthening of the euro 
in local currency  sales increased year over year 
pricing was flat as compared with fiscal fsg  which was acquired at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  contributed  to sales for the year 
excluding fsg  sales in local currency declined 
full year sales reflected a reduction of  on a reported basis in microelectronics excluding the impact of fsg  the effect of pricing reductions for blood filters in the first three quarters of fiscal  as well as the effect of the downturn in the commercial aerospace market and the malaise in the us industrial markets 
for a detailed discussion of sales  refer to review of market segments and geographies 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  increased to from in the prior year 
the increase in cost of sales reflects reduced pricing related to multiple long term contracts with large blood center customers  most of which took effect in the fourth quarter of fiscal  inventory write downs in asia  the effect of a change in product mix and the impact of fsg which historically operated at lower gross margins than pall 
in addition  the increase in cost of sales reflects a one time purchase accounting adjustment of  we consider this item to be non recurring in nature because  although we acquired the manufacturing operations of fsg  this adjustment was required by sfas no 
as an elimination of the manufacturing profit of inventory acquired from fsg and sold in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to from in fiscal the year over year comparison of selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was negatively impacted by a  property tax refund that reduced the prior year s expenses and by  in costs incurred in fiscal to integrate fsg 
excluding these factors  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales would have increased  reflecting severance payments unrelated to acquisitions  and inflationary increases in certain costs such as salaries  pension expense and insurance 
fsg added approximately  to selling  general and administrative expenses in the year 
r d expenses declined to of sales from in fiscal  reflecting our efforts to hold down controllable costs 
fsg added approximately  to r d expenses in the year 
the fourth quarter of fiscal included our final r d payment to vitex as a result of the modification of our partnership agreement to eliminate shared research costs 
we worked successfully with vitex on the development of pathogen reduced red blood cells and brought this technology to pivotal phase iii clinical trials 
in fiscal  we incurred approximately  in r d costs as a result of this agreement 
going forward  we will share in vitex s success through royalties on sales as well as stock ownership in the company  but will not have further responsibility for r d 
our products are assured access to the vitex platform wherever it is commercialized 
reference is also made to the other current and non current assets note accompanying the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal years and  we recorded restructuring and other charges of  and  respectively 
the fiscal charge reflected severance costs of  asset write offs of and other exit costs of  an addition of  to a previously established environmental remediation reserve and a  write down of two strategic investments 
the fiscal restructuring charge primarily related to a reduction in workforce as part of our continued cost control efforts 
the details of the fiscal and fiscal charges can be found in the restructuring and other charges note in the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements 
we expect to recover the costs of the restructuring related charges within two years from the date of each charge 
net interest expense for the year declined  compared with fiscal the reduction in interest expense reflects decreased interest rates  lower average debt levels during the first three quarters of fiscal compared with the prior year  and the benefits from a receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swap that we entered into on our  private placement fixed rate debt at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the above positive benefits were partly offset by increased interest expense in the fourth quarter as a result of the interim borrowings to fund the acquisition of fsg 
the underlying effective tax rate for fiscal was compared with in the prior year 
the increase in the underlying effective tax rate reflects a change in the geographic distribution of profits compared with the prior year 
net earnings for the year were  or cents per share  compared with net earnings of  or cents per share in the prior year 
the majority of the decline in net earnings for the year relates to lower sales  principally in our microelectronics and aerospace segments  lower gross margins  principally related to reduced pricing for large blood bank customers  a change in product mix and restructuring and other charges 
in addition  increased expenses that were related to the integration of fsg  severance costs non acquisition related and the benefit in the prior year of a property tax refund  negatively impacted earnings for the year or the comparison of earnings to the prior year 
additionally  it is estimated that earnings per share decreased approximately cent in the year  due to the negative effect of foreign currency translation 
it is estimated that fsg contributed cent per share to fiscal earnings  which includes a cents cost of financing and purchase accounting amortization 
we implemented sfas no 
 in the first quarter of fiscal the full year effect on fiscal would have been to increase earnings by  after pro forma tax effect  or cents per share 
review of market segments and geographies the table below presents sales by market segment with the prior period restated to reflect the life sciences reorganization as discussed in the segment information and geographies note accompanying the consolidated financial statements  including the effect of exchange rates for comparative purposes 
in addition  the table provides the estimated effect fsg had on our reported fiscal sales 
fiscal fiscal change exchange rate difference change in local currency impact of fsg medical biopharmaceuticals total life sciences general industrial aerospace microelectronics total industrial total life sciences sales for the year grew compared with the prior year 
excluding fsg  sales increased 
life sciences represented approximately of our total sales in fiscal and fiscal excluding fsg  life sciences would have comprised of total sales in the current year 
within life sciences  medical segment sales increased as compared with fiscal  with both the blood and critical care sub markets contributing to this gain 
the growth in blood sales reflects increased volume partly offset by reduced pricing associated with long term supply agreements with large blood bank customers  the majority of which took effect in the fourth quarter of fiscal by geography  western hemisphere medical sales  which represent about of our worldwide medical sales  were up slightly year over year as increased blood center sales were offset by declines in hospital and cardiovascular sales 
in europe  medical sales increased  reflecting growth in critical care partly offset by a decline in blood filtration sales 
medical sales in asia increased year over year  primarily due to strong growth in blood center sales in hong kong  korea and singapore 
biopharmaceuticals sales grew compared with the prior year  reflecting growth in both our biosciences and pharmaceutical sub markets 
fsg accounted for of the biopharmaceutical growth year over year 
biosciences grew driven by strong laboratory sales 
sales in our laboratory market grew reflecting strong sales in the molecular biology arena 
additionally  sales in our laboratory market benefited from our innovative distribution agreement with vwr international  which allows our customers easy access to a full range of product and service needs 
laboratory sales also have been positively impacted by the launch of our first well plate products from our strategic alliance with qiagen 
all geographies reported good growth in biosciences 
the pharmaceutical sub market grew compared with fiscal reflecting robust sales in the biotechnology sector during the first half of the year 
all geographies contributed to this gain  however  pharmaceutical product sales were particularly strong in europe and asia 
our industrial business accounted for approximately of total sales in this year excluding fsg and in the prior year 
industrial sales grew compared with the prior year reflecting the acquisition of fsg  which contributed  in sales in the fourth quarter 
excluding fsg  sales for our industrial business were down reflecting a sharp decline in microelectronics sales see the following discussion regarding microelectronics segment sales 
excluding microelectronics  as well as the impact of the fsg acquisition  sales for the balance of our industrial business increased 
general industrial segment sales  which are the largest portion of our industrial business  increased compared with the prior year fueled by fsg  which contributed  in sales in the fourth quarter 
excluding fsg  sales were up  despite a backdrop of weakened us and european demand in the cyclical industrial end markets 
for the year  solid double digit growth was achieved in the power generation  food beverage and water processing product lines both with and without fsg  as these are generally non cyclical in nature 
the fuels chemicals sub market  which was one of the largest beneficiaries of fsg sales  grew and excluding fsg  posted low single digit growth 
sales in machinery equipment  the largest market within general industrial  declined year over year down  excluding fsg 
the machinery equipment market includes cyclical markets such as pulp paper  primary metals  machine tools and mobile equipment  as such  sales were negatively impacted by weakened demand throughout fiscal  principally in the us by geography  general industrial sales in asia were up up  excluding fsg reflecting good growth in fuels chemicals and food beverage partly offset by declines in water processing and power generation 
machinery equipment sales in asia were up slightly  but down excluding fsg 
sales in europe increased compared with the prior year  primarily due to the acquisition of fsg  which contributed  in sales in the fourth quarter 
excluding fsg  general industrial sales in europe were up  as moderate growth in power generation  water processing and fuels chemicals were partly offset by declines in food beverage and machinery equipment 
in the western hemisphere  sales increased year over year attributable to the acquisition of fsg  which added  in sales in the fourth quarter 
excluding fsg  sales were flat as strong growth in the non cyclical markets such as power generation  water processing and food beverage was offset by a decline in machinery equipment attributable to weakened demand in the us marketplace 
aerospace sales were flat compared with fiscal as strong growth in military sales up during the first half of the year was offset by an overall decline in the commercial side of the business of  which reflects the continued downturn in the commercial airline industry after the tragic events of september military sales comprised of total aerospace sales this year compared with in the prior year 
by geography  aerospace sales in europe were flat as strong military and commercial marine water sales were offset by a decline in the balance of the commercial business 
in the western hemisphere  where approximately of the commercial aerospace business is generated  sales were down  as declines in the commercial side of the business more than offset strong growth in military sales 
asia reported strong growth in both military and commercial aerospace sales  although the size of our aerospace business there is not as significant 
microelectronics sales declined compared with the prior year  which includes  in sales generated from fsg

on a sequential quarter basis  sales were up from quarter three excluding fsg 
the consolidated operating profit as a percentage of sales for the year declined to from in fiscal in life sciences  overall operating profit declined to from in the prior year reflecting the impact of reduced pricing related to multiple long term contracts with large blood center customers  the majority of which took effect in the fourth quarter of fiscal the benefit of increased volume as a result of these contracts partly offset the negative impact of the reduced pricing 
within life sciences  medical operating profit for the year declined to from in the prior year reflecting the price decreases mentioned previously

liquidity and capital resources the acquisition of fsg in the third quarter of fiscal was initially funded via a  day variable rate credit facility 
on august   we issued  of year bonds at an annual interest rate of 
the proceeds were utilized to repay a portion of the interim acquisition credit facility 
additionally  on october   we refinanced the remainder of the acquisition credit facility with a  term loan bearing interest based on libor 
we received  representing  of fair value for receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of  terminated on november   and  of accrued interest receivable through the termination date 
the terminated swaps related to our  private placement of unsecured senior notes due in simultaneously  we entered into new interest rate swaps with a notional amount of  involving the  notes due on august  the new swaps required that we make payments at a variable rate based on libor and receive payments at a fixed rate of 
on may   we received  representing  of fair value for the new receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swaps terminated on may   and  of accrued interest receivable through the termination date 
simultaneously  we entered into new receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swaps with a notional amount of  involving the  notes due on august  except for an increase in the spread above libor  the terms of the new interest rate swaps were substantially the same as those of the terminated swap 
the  of fair value received to terminate the interest rate swaps will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining lives of the underlying notes 
on june   we refinanced our yen billion loan approximately  which was due on that day  until june  the terms of the loan require us to make interest payments at a floating rate based upon yen libor 
on march   we entered into a forward dated receive variable  pay fixed interest rate swap related to this loan  whereby we will receive payments at a variable rate based upon yen libor and make payments at a fixed rate of 
on a notional amount of yen billion 
the swap expires on june  in april  we amended the terms of the receive variable  pay fixed interest rate swap related to certain borrowings under the senior credit facility 
the company receives payments at a variable rate based on libor and makes payments at an effective fixed rate of on a notional amount of  the swap expires in february net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was  an increase of  as compared with fiscal the increase in cash flow from operations was generated by increased earnings as well as cash generated from changes in working capital items such as accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable 
the company s balance sheet is affected by spot exchange rates used to translate local currency amounts into us dollars 
in comparing spot exchange rates at august  to those at the end of fiscal  the european currencies and the yen have strengthened against the us dollar 
working capital was approximately  a ratio of at august  as compared with  a ratio of at august  accounts receivable days sales outstanding was days  as compared with days at august   while inventory turns have improved to from the effect of foreign exchange increased inventory  accounts receivable and other current assets by   and  respectively  as compared with august  additionally  foreign exchange increased accounts payable and other current liabilities by  and income taxes payable by  when operating the business day to day  excluding acquisitions but including funding capital expenditures and buying back common stock  our current intention is to keep net debt debt net of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at to of total capitalization net debt plus equity 
net debt decreased by approximately  compared with year end fiscal the impact of foreign exchange rates accounted for  of the reduction  while the fair value adjustment on our fixed to variable interest rate swaps carried as part of debt decreased debt by approximately  as such  the actual cash reduction in our net debt was  in fiscal overall  net debt  as a percentage of total capitalization  was as compared with at year end fiscal total debt decreased  or about as compared with fiscal we utilized our cash flow from operations as well as a tax efficient transfer of overseas cash to achieve this reduction in total debt 
our goal for fiscal is to reduce net debt by an additional  refer to the notes payable and long term debt note accompanying the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s debt and related covenants 
our goal for fiscal was to return to the net debt levels that existed before the acquisition of fsg 
therefore  we did not purchase treasury stock during the year 
proceeds from stock plans were  in fiscal capital expenditures were  in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense were  and  respectively 
our goal is to keep capital expenditures below  in fiscal on october   the company s board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to  to repurchase shares of the company s common stock 
as mentioned previously  we modified our partnership agreement with vitex to eliminate shared research costs 
on june   we purchased  vitex shares for  including the final milestone payment of  as per our agreement with vitex and concurrently  vitex repaid the  borrowed under the one year line of credit that we had extended them 
vitex management has indicated in their form q  for the second quarter ended june   that their cash balances of  were adequate to support operations until the end of december we consider our existing lines of credit  along with the cash generated from operations  to be sufficient for future growth 
it is management s intention to refinance any unpaid amounts under the unsecured senior revolving credit facility when it expires in the following is a summary of our contractual commitments as of august  year ended thereafter total long term debt operating leases purchase commitments employment contracts total commitments maturities of long term debt include unamortized proceeds from interest rate swaps of  in each year ended included in the column headed thereafter are unamortized proceeds from interest rate swaps of  and the decreased fair value of our long term debt by  recently issued accounting pronouncement in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no

forward looking statements the matters discussed in this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are based on current company expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  regulatory approval and market acceptance of new technologies  changes in product mix and product pricing and in interest rates and cost of raw materials  the company s success in enforcing its patents and protecting its proprietary products and manufacturing techniques  global and regional economic conditions and legislative  regulatory and political developments  and domestic and international competition in the company s global markets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary market risks relate to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our acquisition of fsg at the end of the third quarter of fiscal has not materially changed our market risks 
the sensitivity analyses presented below assume simultaneous shifts in each respective rate  and quantify the impact on our earnings and cash flows 
the changes used for these analyses reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
actual changes that differ from the changes used for these analyses could yield materially different results 
foreign currency our reporting currency is the us dollar 
because we operate through subsidiaries or branches in over thirty countries around the world  our earnings are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of the subsidiaries or branches  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
most of our products are manufactured in the us  including puerto rico  germany and the united kingdom  and then sold into many countries 
the primary foreign currency exposures relate to adverse changes in the relationships of the us dollar to the british pound the pound  the japanese yen the yen and the euro  as well as adverse changes in the relationship of the pound to the euro 
exposure exists when the functional currency of the buying subsidiaries weakens against the us dollar  the pound or the euro thus causing an increase of the product cost to the buying subsidiary  which adversely affects the company s consolidated gross margin and net income 
the effect of foreign exchange is partially mitigated because of the significant level of manufacturing done in europe 
the deterioration of the yen against the us dollar has a greater proportional adverse effect on our earnings because the majority of japan s purchases are sourced from the us due to the difficulty in estimating the economic effect of foreign currency rates  particularly in periods of high volatility of such rates  we no longer provide such estimated effects and report only the translation effect to earnings per share 
we estimate that foreign exchange translation added cents to earnings per share for the year 
in fiscal year  the euro  the pound and the yen appreciated by approximately  and  respectively  against the us dollar compared with the average exchange rates in effect in fiscal additionally  the euro appreciated against the pound by approximately 
we are also exposed to transaction risk from adverse changes in exchange rates 
these short term transaction exposures are primarily yen denominated receivables held in the us and euro denominated receivables held in the united kingdom 
these short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are managed by purchasing forward foreign exchange contracts forwards to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
in addition  we enter into loans denominated in foreign currencies to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables 
we do not enter into forwards for trading purposes 
at august   these exposures amounted to approximately  and were offset by forwards with a notional principal amount of  if a hypothetical simultaneous adverse change had occurred in exchange rates  net earnings would have decreased by approximately  or approximately cents per share 
interest rates we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily due to our financing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt as well as cash and certain short term  highly liquid investments considered to be cash equivalents 
our debt portfolio is comprised of a combination of fixed rate and floating rate borrowings 
factoring in the effect of our interest rate swaps on our debt  at august  our debt portfolio was variable rate debt 
as such  we view our primary interest rate risk to be potential near term decreases in earnings and cash flows due to increases in variable interest rates 
the cash flows on the above mentioned interest rate swaps mirror the cash flows of the hedged underlying debt instruments 
we do not enter into interest rate swaps for trading purposes 
as of august   we had interest rate swaps with notional amounts aggregating  outstanding comprised of fair value interest rate swaps ie  fixed to variable rate swaps of  and cash flow interest rate swaps ie  variable to fixed rate swaps of  the fair value of our interest rate swaps at august  was a liability of  for the year ended august   interest expense  net of interest income  was  a hypothetical increase in market interest rates over the actual fiscal average rate would have had an immaterial impact on net interest expense and net earnings
