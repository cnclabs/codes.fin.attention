item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we are one of the largest heavy civil contractors in the united states and are engaged in the construction of highways  dams  airports  mass transit facilities and other infrastructure related projects 
we have offices in california  washington  oregon  alaska  texas  georgia  nevada  arizona  florida  new york and utah 
our business involves two operating segments the branch division and the heavy construction division 
our contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to advertisements by federal  state and local agencies  and private parties and to a lesser extent through negotiation with private parties 
our bidding activity is affected by such factors as backlog  current utilization of equipment and other resources  ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
bidding activity  backlog and revenue resulting from the award of new contracts may vary significantly from period to period 
our general and administrative costs include salaries and related expenses  incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation  as well as other overhead costs to support our overall business 
in general  these costs will increase in response to the growth and the related increased complexity of our business 
these costs may also vary depending on the number of projects in process in a particular area and the corresponding level of estimating activity 
for example  as large projects are completed or if the level of work slows down in a particular area  we will often re assign employees who had been working on projects to estimating and bidding activities until another project becomes available  which temporarily moves their salaries and other related costs from cost of revenue to general and administrative expense 
additionally  our compensation strategy for selected management personnel is to rely heavily on a variable cash and restricted stock performance based incentive element 
the cash portion of these incentives is expensed when earned while the restricted stock portion is expensed over the vesting period of the stock generally five years 
depending on the mix of cash and restricted stock  these incentives can have the effect of increasing general and administrative expenses in a very profitable year and decreasing expenses in less profitable years 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience  however actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include the recognition of revenue and earnings from construction contracts  accounting for construction joint ventures  the valuation of long lived assets and the estimation of valuation allowances and accrued liabilities 
we evaluate all of our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
revenue recognition for construction contracts the majority of our contracts with our customers are either fixed unit price or fixed price 
under fixed unit price contracts  we are committed to provide materials or services required by a project at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete or cubic yards of earth excavated 
while the fixed unit price contract shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required for a particular project to the customer  any increase in our unit cost over the unit price bid  whether due to inflation  inefficiency  faulty estimates or other factors  is borne by us unless otherwise provided in the contract 
fixed price contracts are priced on a lump sum basis under which we bear the risk that we may not be able to perform all the work for the specified contract amount 
our design build projects are generally fixed price contracts and  primarily as a result of the growth in our design build business in the last several years  the number of design build contracts has been increasing 
all federal government contracts and many of our other contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the party contracting with us  with provisions to pay us for work performed through the date of termination 
we use the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue and earnings on construction contracts  including construction joint ventures  are recognized on the percentage of completion method in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
provisions are recognized in the statement of income for the full amount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
revenue from contract claims is recognized when we have a signed settlement agreement and payment is assured 
revenue from contract change orders is recognized when the owner has agreed to the change order 
revenue in an amount equal to cost incurred is recognized prior to contracts reaching completion 
the related profit is deferred until the period in which such percentage completion is attained 
it is our judgment that until a project reaches completion  there is insufficient information to determine with a reasonable level of assurance what the estimated profit on the project will be 
contract cost consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
depreciation is provided using accelerated methods for construction equipment 
contract cost is recorded as incurred and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
the threshold is applied to all percentage of completion projects without exception unless and until we project a loss on the project  in which case the estimated loss is immediately recognized 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is almost solely dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
our cost estimates use a highly detailed bottom up approach and we believe our experience allows us to produce materially reliable estimates 
however  our projects can be highly complex and in almost every case the profit margin estimates for a project will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have many projects of varying levels of complexity and size in process at any given time during we worked on over  projects these changes in estimates can offset each other without materially impacting our profitability 
however  large changes in cost estimates  particularly in the bigger  more complex projects in our heavy construction division  can have a more significant effect on profitability 
factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability include  without limitation  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent that contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project  the availability and proximity of materials  the accuracy of the original bid and subsequent estimates  inclement weather and timing and coordination issues inherent in all projects  including design build projects 
the foregoing factors as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods and these fluctuations may be significant 
construction joint ventures as described under note to our consolidated financial statements  we participate in various construction joint venture partnerships in order to share expertise  risk and resources for certain highly complex projects 
generally  each construction joint venture is formed to accomplish a specific project  is jointly controlled by the joint venture partners and is dissolved upon completion of the project 
we select our joint venture partners based on our analysis of the prospective venturer s construction and financial capabilities  expertise in the type of work to be performed and past working relationships with us  among other criteria 
the joint venture agreements typically provide that our interests in any profits and assets  and our respective share in any losses and liabilities that may result from the performance of the contract are limited to our stated percentage interest in the project 
the venture s contract with the project owner typically requires joint and several liability among the joint venture partners 
our agreements with our joint venture partners provide that each party will assume and pay its full proportionate share of any losses resulting from a project  however  if one of our partners was unable to pay its proportionate share we would be fully liable under our contract with the project owner 
circumstances that could lead to a loss under these guarantee arrangements include a partner s inability to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event that the project incurred a loss or additional costs that we could incur should the partner fail to provide the services and resources toward project completion that had been committed to in the joint venture agreement 
under each joint venture agreement  one partner is designated as the sponsor 
the sponsoring partner typically provides all administrative  accounting and most of the project management support for the project and generally receives a fee from the joint venture for these services 
we have been designated as the sponsoring partner in certain of our current joint venture projects and are a non sponsor in others 
consistent with industry practice  we account for our share of the operations of these jointly controlled ventures on a pro rata basis in the consolidated statements of income and as a single line item in the consolidated balance sheets 
if we were to account for these interests using a one line item equity method presentation in the consolidated statements of income  revenue and contract costs would be materially lower  however  net income would not change 
alternatively  if we were to account for these interests using full consolidation  assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet would be materially higher and revenue and contract costs in the consolidated statements of income would be materially higher  however  net income would not change 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  equipment and acquired identifiable intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management and this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
additionally  we had approximately million in goodwill at december   primarily related to our acquisition of halmar builders of new york  inc in which was recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas under the transitional rules of that statement 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and more frequently when events and circumstances occur that indicate a possible impairment of goodwill 
in determining whether there is an impairment of goodwill  we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill is recorded using a discounted future cash flow method 
we then compare the resulting fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize a goodwill impairment loss 
we performed our annual impairment test in and we determined that no impairment had occurred 
the discounted future cash flow method used in the first step of our impairment test involves significant estimates including future cash inflows from estimated revenues  future cash outflows from estimated project cost and general and administrative costs  estimates of timing of collection and payment of various items and future growth rates as well as discount rate and terminal value assumptions 
although we believe the estimates and assumptions that we used in testing for impairment are reasonable and supportable  significant changes in any one of these assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
valuation allowances and accrued liabilities we grant credit to customers that include general contractors  property owners and developers  governmental agencies and other companies in a variety of industries 
although we generally do not require collateral  the law provides us with the ability to file mechanics liens on real property improved for private customers in the event of non payment 
we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and the general economy 
we analyze specific customer accounts receivable including the age of specific accounts  customer payment history and general economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we carry insurance policies to cover various risks  primarily general liability and workers compensation  under which we are liable to reimburse the insurance company for a portion of each claim paid 
the amounts that we are liable for generally range from the first million to million per occurrence 
we accrue for the estimated ultimate liability for incurred losses  both reported and unreported  using actuarial methods based on historic trends modified  if necessary  by recent events 
there can be no assurance that the actual amounts of our valuation allowances and estimated accrued liabilities will not change as better information becomes available  and these changes could be significant 
current year revenue years ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent in thousands revenue by division branch division    heavy construction division    revenue by geographic area california    west excluding california    midwest    south    northeast    revenue by market sector federal agencies    state agencies    local public agencies    total public sector    private sector    material sales    revenue revenue for the year ended december  increased over the year ended december  by million  or 
branch division revenue in included million of revenue from our newly consolidated majority owned wilder construction company wilder subsidiary and million of revenue from the businesses acquired from robinson construction company and parnum paving  inc robinson and parnum see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the wilder  robinson and parnum revenue  branch division revenue for decreased compared with by million  or 
revenue was lower in many of our branch division s locations in compared to  with the most significant decreases in utah and california excluding parnum and robinson and decreases were experienced in both public and private sector revenue 
we believe the decreases are attributable to a general slowdown in private development projects and the related increased competitiveness in bidding for public sector projects due to a weak economic climate as well as a lower level of funding available for public sector projects in many of our locations 
revenue from our heavy construction division increased in the year ended december  over the year ended december  included in hcd revenue in was million of revenue from our new granite halmar location in new york 
the granite halmar business was acquired on july  and made its first revenue contribution in the third quarter of in addition to the impact of having our new york location for a full year in versus six months in  the increased hcd revenue in reflects larger volume from higher backlog at the beginning of revenue from the sale of materials in included million from wilder and the businesses acquired from parnum and robinson 
excluding this revenue  our revenue from the sale of materials increased million  or  in as compared with  due to the combined factors of higher unit selling prices and slightly higher volume in many of our locations 
we believe that unit selling prices have been positively influenced by the growing scarcity of permitted aggregate resources 
backlog december  amount percent amount percent in thousands backlog by division branch division   heavy construction division   backlog by geographic area california   west excluding california   midwest   south   northeast   backlog by market sector federal agencies   state agencies   local public agencies   total public sector   private sector   backlog our backlog at december  of  million was million  or higher than our backlog at december  our backlog includes million of backlog in our branch division from our newly consolidated wilder subsidiary and the businesses acquired from parnum and robinson 
the increased branch division backlog reflects higher backlog from public sector projects due primarily to its share of a million design build railroad project in nevada that is shared between our branch division and hcd as well as the contributions from wilder and the businesses acquired from parnum and robinson 
the increased backlog of public sector projects in our branch division at december  was partially offset by a million  or  decrease in branch division private sector backlog from december  which we believe is attributable to the impact of a slowdown in private development projects due to a relatively weak economic climate see outlook 
heavy construction division backlog increased from  million at december  to  million at december  the increase was largely due to higher backlog at our granite halmar location in new york and also reflected the high number of large  complex projects  including design build projects that were available to bid nationwide in see outlook 
hcd s awards in the fourth quarter of include three new projects for its granite halmar location in new york a million new york city transit project  a million amtrak project  and a million portion of a million subway reconstruction project joint venture 
although our backlog of projects in california grew slightly in compared with  it declined as a percentage of total backlog from in to in due to relatively greater increases in other parts of the west  primarily from wilder  and in the northeast at our granite halmar location in new york 
our backlog from local public agency projects at december  increased significantly from the amount at december   primarily because of the award of the million design build railroad project in nevada and the million new york city transit project during gross profit years ended december  in thousands total gross profit    percent of revenue gross profit our gross profit as a percent of revenue increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   as a result of higher gross profit margins in hcd partially offset by slightly lower gross profit margins in our branch division 
the increase in hcd gross profit margin in was largely due to a generally more profitable mix of hcd projects compared to a year ago and the absence of a deterioration in margin of a non sponsored joint venture project on the east coast that we experienced in this increase was partially offset by the recognition of additional costs to complete several new york area projects that negatively impacted gross margin in the first and second quarters of additionally  both hcd and branch division gross profit margins were slightly negatively impacted by an increase in the amount of revenue recognized from projects that had not yet reached complete from million in to million in we recognize revenue only to the extent of cost  deferring profit recognition  until a project reaches complete 
branch division gross profit margins were also impacted in by lower profitability on certain projects assumed in the acquisition of the parnum and robinson businesses as well as increased competition in a slower economic climate 
cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  subcontractor costs  direct overhead costs and equipment expense primarily depreciation  maintenance and repairs 
although the composition of costs varies with each contract  our gross profit margins were not significantly impacted by changes in any one of these costs during general and administrative expenses years ended december  in thousands salaries and related expenses    incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation    other general and administrative expenses    total    percent of revenue general and administrative expenses 
salaries and related expenses increased in the year ended december  over due to increased staffing to support our current and expected growth  including approximately million in costs associated with the consolidation of wilder and our geographic expansion into northern california and approximately million resulting from the inclusion of the granite halmar location in new york for the entire year in versus only six months in additionally  salaries and related expenses increased in certain locations due to certain personnel normally charged to job cost being temporarily reassigned to general and administrative cost to bid new work while awaiting reassignment to another project 
incentive compensation increased in primarily due to higher operating income in our heavy construction division and the inclusion of wilder in the amount 
increases in other general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from costs associated with our continued growth  including costs associated with our expansion into northern california and new york as well as the inclusion of costs from the newly consolidated wilder subsidiary 
other general and administrative costs include information technology  occupancy  office equipment and supplies  depreciation  travel and entertainment  outside services  advertising and marketing  training and other miscellaneous expenses  none of which individually exceeded of total general and administrative expense 
operating income years ended december  in thousands branch division    heavy construction division    unallocated other corporate expenses    total    operating income our heavy construction division s contribution to operating income increased in compared to due primarily to increased volume at a higher profit margin as described in revenue and gross profit above 
branch division operating income in included approximately million from our newly consolidated wilder subsidiary and our expansion into northern california and was lower in compared to primarily because of lower revenue and gross profit margins as described in revenue and gross profit above 
unallocated other corporate expenses principally comprises corporate general and administrative expenses 
other income expense years ended december  in thousands interest income    interest expense    gain on sales of property and equipment    other  net    total    other income expense other income decreased by million to million in compared with the decrease was due primarily to the absence of million recognized on the sale of excess and developed property in  lower gains on the sale of equipment and the impact of discontinuing recording the results of tic holdings  inc tic and wilder in other income under the equity method of accounting during the second quarter of see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our interest income was negatively impacted by lower interest rates on our investments in offset by the recognition of deferred interest income on a note receivable from the california private transportation company  lp when collectibility became assured in the fourth quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements  and recognition of look back interest income related to taxes paid in previous years on income from certain construction projects 
provision for income taxes years ended december  in thousands provision for income taxes    effective tax rate provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased to in from in due to the combined factors of higher percentage depletion deductions related to quarry properties and higher tax credits 
we currently expect that we will be able to maintain this effective tax rate through the end of outlook looking ahead at  we are entering the year with a record backlog of billion and a cautiously optimistic outlook for the months ahead 
our outlook is influenced by a number of key economic and political issues facing our industry this year 
while this will undoubtedly be a key year for transportation funding  both at the state and federal levels  this is also a year of uncertainty as state budget deficits remain and the war with iraq threatens the amount of funding that will be spent on transportation infrastructure 
based on our bidding successes in and the tremendous number of available bidding opportunities  the business outlook for hcd is very good 
we are continuing to witness a number of larger projects coming out to bid in highway  transit and bridge construction 
in addition  we are optimistic about our granite halmar business and the increasing number of similar opportunities in the new york city area market including the port authority of new york and new jersey s recent approval of a billion budget for that includes billion for new transportation facilities 
hcd is targeting bidding opportunities nationwide  including large  technically complex design build projects  which we believe play to our strengths 
examples of upcoming bidding opportunities include three projects in texas totaling approximately million  a to million highway project in california  a to million transit project in philadelphia and an approximately million bridge project in maryland 
as it relates to our existing backlog of work and potential new work  it is important to note that due to the size of the projects and the time it takes to reach the percent complete profit recognition threshold  any new award would not likely impact earnings until late or our branch division performance in will depend on the levels of transportation spending on the local  state and federal level in addition to the strength and timing of an economic recovery 
while some branches are continuing to witness demand for site development for residential and commercial construction  others are anticipating a down year due to the current economic environment and its negative impact on the demand for private sector work in their areas 
historically  a slowdown in the private sector work generally translates into increased competition in the public sector bidding arena 
with respect to oil prices  we are subject to oil price volatility as it relates primarily to our use of liquid asphalt and diesel fuel 
some of our projects are indexed and include price escalation clauses that provide protection in the event that oil product prices increase significantly 
although we are exposed to price spikes in projects that do not include such clauses  we have historically been able to recover some or all of those costs as prices come down 
this holds particularly true in our branches due to the short duration of their projects and their ability to respond quickly to fluctuating prices 
in general  while we may have some exposure in this area of our business  we have not been materially adversely impacted to date 
at the state level  we will be paying close attention to how the states resolve their respective budget shortfalls 
according to the american road and transportation builders association artba  if the states react by delaying some highway construction to help alleviate the budget pressures  the highway construction season in could be stretched as thin as it was this year 
in a survey conducted by artba  of the largest state departments of transportation are trying to maintain level highway construction programs in or even provide some growth 
also according to artba  approximately states are working to overcome a combined budget gap of billion in their most recent fiscal year ending june and a combined billion deficit for the fiscal year 
most states  unlike the federal government  are required by law to balance their budgets 
in california  where of our revenues were derived  the state is faced with a significant budget shortfall 
projections from the legislative analyst s office fiscal outlook and the administration s governor s budget estimates the shortfall to be between billion and  respectively 
in an attempt to reduce the shortfall  a budget proposal from governor gray davis calls for significant reductions for both the current year and budget year 
the proposed budget includes a billion cut in transportation funding  largely consisting of the suspension of the proposition transfer of the sales tax revenues derived from gasoline sales in billion  the forgiveness of a scheduled general fund loan repayment to the state highway account million  and recapturing transportation congestion relief program funds not yet allocated in million 
although it is too early to quantify the impact that this crisis will have on our business  the branches do anticipate a decrease in the amount of work the california department of transportation will be putting out to bid 
the california legislature will consider the governor s proposal over the next few months as it attempts to agree on the state s budget 
agreement may be quite difficult and may take the rest of the year 
overall  we believe that a strong performance in hcd in has the potential to offset the expected decrease in the branch division s financial results this is an excellent example of the value of granite s diversification strategy 
our ability to diversify projects  customers and geographic markets  allows us to better withstand fluctuations in the economy and to mitigate the risks inherent in the construction business 
more specifically  while the nature of the projects performed by the branches is short term turn business  the larger and longer duration projects undertaken by hcd provide us with more long term visibility and consistency in earnings 
it is this difference that helps to make what is naturally an unpredictable business somewhat more predictable 
on the federal front  after much debate  the house of representatives and the senate recently passed a billion federal transportation bill for fiscal year last year  the bush administration s budget recommendation called for an billion or cut to transportation funding based on lower than expected revenue contributions to the highway trust fund 
the billion level is in line with fiscal year spending levels and is likely to serve as a baseline for the upcoming reauthorization of the transportation equity act for the st century tea 
in late february  the house transportation and infrastructure t i committee recommended to the house budget committee a combined federal highway and transit program funding level of billion for fiscal year later this year  congress will begin focusing on the tea reauthorization bill 
the current legislation expires on september  and was the largest federal spending bill in history 
signed by president clinton on june   tea was a six year  billion program providing federal funding for highway and transit construction 
the size of the next reauthorization bill remains a key question in the process 
while tea provided a increase in highway spending over the prior authorization  additional sources of revenue for the reauthorization bill may be harder to find at this time 
t i committee chairman don young r alaska has publicly announced his support of indexing the federal gas tax  which  according to industry officials  could potentially raise billion over the life of the next highway bill 
other proposals by industry groups for a large increase would require either a gas tax increase or bond issuance both of which are likely to meet with resistance in the republican controlled congress and administration 
in summary  we are very pleased with the success of our current operations in what could be characterized as a challenging economy 
we enter with a healthy backlog of work and a number of substantial bidding opportunities ahead for hcd 
in the long term  we remain optimistic that both the state and federal leaders will work to provide the funding that is needed to meet the nation s growing transportation needs 
prior years revenue and backlog 
total revenue in increased to  million from  million in  which reflected increases in both divisions 
branch division revenue increased in due to increases in public sector revenue and revenue from material sales which were partially offset by a decrease in private sector revenue 
the increased revenue from material sales was due to both higher sales volume and generally higher unit prices 
the higher volume was largely due to increases in construction activity near certain of our plant locations 
hcd revenue increased in due primarily to revenue generated from contracts added to backlog in late through mid and revenue contributed by hcd s new granite halmar location in new york of approximately million 
on a market sector basis  revenue from private sector contracts decreased million to million or of total revenue in  from million or of total revenue in our private sector work was primarily comprised of site preparation for both commercial and residential developments and privately funded transportation projects 
our revenue from public sector contracts increased to  million or of total revenue in from million or of total revenue in the level of funding for public sector projects remained strong through in most of our geographic markets 
our backlog at december  was  million  up million  or from december  the increase in backlog was primarily attributable to hcd backlog obtained as a result of the halmar acquisition as well as awards in the latter half of which included our million share of a subway reconstruction project in new york  our million share of a design build rail reconstruction project in florida and a million highway project in north carolina 
gross profit 
for the year ended december   gross profit was million  a million decrease from as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased in to from in the decreased gross profit margin reflected decreases in hcd that were partially offset by slightly increased profit margins in the branch division 
contributing to the decline in the hcd profit margin was a reduction in forecasted profitability of a non sponsored joint venture project on the east coast  a generally less profitable mix of hcd projects compared to the prior year and a higher level of revenue recognized for projects less than complete 
year to date revenue recognized for projects less than complete was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
as described under critical accounting policies above  we recognized revenue only to the extent of cost incurred until a project reaches complete 
the reduction in forecasted profitability of an east coast joint venture project partially related to the acceleration of work to complete the project on time to avoid paying liquidated damages 
we recorded a pretax loss of approximately million for our portion of the expected reduced profitability of the project in the year ended december  cost of revenue consists of direct costs on contracts  including labor and materials  amounts payable to subcontractors  direct overhead costs and equipment expense primarily depreciation  fuel  maintenance and repairs 
although the composition of costs varies with each contract  our gross profit margins were not significantly impacted by changes in any one of these costs during we did experience upward pressure on costs associated with natural gas  fuel and asphalt prices early in  but these had substantially reversed by the end of the year and our gross profit margins were not materially impacted by these changes 
general and administrative expenses 
salaries and related expenses increased in over due primarily to increased staffing to support our current and expected growth including staff supporting our new granite halmar location in new york 
incentive compensation and discretionary profit sharing and pension costs decreased in compared to primarily as a function of our decreased profitability and the absence of additional expense recognized in related to the impact of certain members of our management reaching age other general and administrative expenses include various costs to support our operations  none of which exceeded of total general and administrative expenses 
the increase in other general and administrative expenses in primarily reflected the increases in facilities  information technology support  pre bidding and other costs to support our growth 
operating income 
hcd s contribution to operating income in decreased compared with the contribution due to the decreased gross profit margin as described in gross profit above 
additionally  hcd s general and administrative expenses increased during to support the higher level of revenue and backlog as well as increased costs to support a high level of bidding activity during the year 
the branch division s contribution to operating income in increased compared to due primarily to increases in gross profit margin related to materials sales during the year 
other income expense 
other income increased by million to million in from million in the increase was attributable to gains recognized on the sale of excess and developed property of approximately million and higher equity in earnings recognized from our investments in tic and wilder 
although we had higher levels of cash equivalents and other investments during  the effect of declining interest rates left interest income relatively flat as compared to provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was in and in the decrease reflected the absence of additional tax expense recognized in related to our reaching an agreement with tic to divest our investment over a three and one half year period 
liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents    net cash provided used by operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    capital expenditures    working capital    during  we generated cash and cash equivalents from operating activities of million  which represented a decrease of million compared with a reduction in cash and cash equivalents from net changes in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represented a significant portion of the overall decrease and was attributable to the absence of the large growth in this balance we experienced in the growth was due to cash timing differences on several large projects added to our backlog in the latter half of additionally  cash and cash equivalents increased due to a decrease in accounts receivable in  due primarily to lower revenue in the fourth quarter of after adjusting for the impact of wilder and higher collections 
this increase was offset by a corresponding decrease in accounts payable which was due to the cost impact of lower fourth quarter revenue 
cash used by investing activities in increased by million compared with due to higher net purchases of marketable securities  lower proceeds from sales of property and equipment and higher amounts spent acquiring businesses which were partially offset by lower purchases of property and equipment and cash received from tic holdings  inc tic related to the repurchase of tic shares held by the company 
during the third quarter of  the company purchased million of us government debt securities with maturities through that have been recorded as long term marketable securities in the consolidated balance sheet at december  the longer term securities were purchased as part of our overall investment strategy that is designed to balance liquidity with achieving a reasonable rate of return on our invested balances 
cash used by financing activities in was million as compared to million provided by financing activities in  reflecting the absence of significant proceeds from long term debt and the increase in cash expended to repurchase our stock  partially offset by proceeds received from the exercise of warrants to purchase the our stock during as more fully described in note and note to our consolidated financial statements  the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations outstanding as of december  in thousands total thereafter senior notes payable        other notes payable        operating lease payments        deferred compensation      total        the years of expected payment of deferred compensation are based on estimates and may be subject to change 
in  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase  at our management s discretion  up to million of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated block purchases  exclusive of repurchases related to employee benefit plans  of which approximately million remained at september  on september   our board of directors authorized us to repurchase million of our common stock 
the million authorization replaced the million remaining from the prior authorization 
in addition  we are authorized to purchase shares for contribution to our employee stock ownership plan esop 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock on the open market for a total purchase price of million 
of the shares repurchased   shares were retired and  shares were contributed to the esop 
on march   we announced a quarterly cash dividend of per share on our common stock 
the dividend is payable on april  to stockholders of record on march  we had standby letters of credit totaling approximately million outstanding at december   all of which expire during additionally  we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security under certain public and private sector contracts 
at december   approximately billion of our backlog was bonded and performance bonds totaling approximately billion were outstanding 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  rather  we are released from the bonds when each contract is completed 
our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization  working capital  past performance  management expertise and external factors including the capacity of the overall surety market 
surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our backlog that is currently bonded and their current underwriting standards  which may change from time to time 
we have been bonded by the same surety for more than years and have never been refused a bond 
during  we added two additional sureties to ensure access to bonding in support of our growth 
the inability to obtain surety bonds would have a material adverse effect on our business 
as described under critical accounting policies above  we participate in various construction joint venture partnerships 
under the joint ventures contracts with the project owners each of the partners are joint and severally liable for performance under the contracts 
although our agreements with our joint venture partners provide that each party will assume and pay its full proportionate share of any losses resulting from a project  if one of our partners was unable to pay its proportionate share we would be fully liable under our contract with the project owner 
circumstances that could lead to a loss under these guarantee arrangements include a partner s inability to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event that the project incurred a loss or additional costs that we could incur should the partner fail to provide the services and resources toward project completion that had been committed to in the joint venture agreement 
at december  approximately million of work representing either our partners proportionate share or work that our partners are directly responsible for  had yet to be completed 
we have never incurred a loss under these joint and several liability provisions  however it is possible that we could in the future and such a loss could be significant 
restrictive covenants under the terms of our debt agreements require the maintenance of certain levels of working capital and cash flow and the maintenance of tangible net worth as defined of approximately million 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  additionally  our wilder subsidiary has restrictive covenants on a wilder stand alone basis under the terms of its debt agreements that include the maintenance of certain ratios of working capital  liabilities to net worth and tangible net worth and restricts wilder capital expenditures in excess of specified limits 
wilder was in compliance with these covenants at december  failure to comply with these covenants could cause the amounts due under the debt agreements to become currently payable 
we expect the principal use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for capital expenditures  working capital  acquisitions and other investments 
we have budgeted million for capital expenditures in  which includes amounts for construction equipment  aggregate and asphalt plants  buildings  leasehold improvements and the purchase of land and aggregate reserves 
in addition to our working capital and cash generated from operations  we currently have access to funds under a million bank revolving line of credit  of which million was available at december  additionally  our wilder subsidiary has a bank revolving line of credit of million  all of which was available at december  both lines of credit expire in june on january   the california private transportation company  lp  of which we are a limited partner  closed the sale of the state route tollroad franchise to the orange county transportation authority for million in cash and the assumption of million in long term debt 
we completed construction of the million project in and have maintained an equity interest in the operations of the facility since it opened in december we will record a gain on the sale of the tollroad of between million and million  net of tax  in the first quarter of  with the exact amount of the gain contingent upon final transaction costs and other miscellaneous adjustments 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and amounts available under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital needs  capital expenditures  financial commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks due largely to changes in interest rates  which we have managed primarily by managing the maturities in our investment portfolio 
through december   we did not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our investment securities or our debt instruments 
we do not transact business in foreign currencies 
the fair value of our short term held to maturity investment portfolio and related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the investment maturities are short and the interest rates are primarily fixed 
the fair value of our long term held to maturity investment portfolio may be impacted by changes in interest rates 
our mutual fund portfolio of million is exposed to equity price risks 
we had senior notes payable of million at december  which carry a fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payments due in nine equal annual installments that began in and senior notes payable of million at december  which carry a fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payments due in nine equal annual installments beginning in in february  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements in order to gain access to the lower borrowing rates normally available on floating rate debt  while avoiding the prepayment and other costs that would be associated with refinancing our long term fixed rate debt 
the swaps purchased have a combined notional amount of million  six month maturity and provide for us to pay variable interest at libor plus set rate spreads and receive fixed interest of between and 
the notional amount does not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities  but rather  is used in the determination of cash settlement under the swap agreement 
as a result of purchasing these swaps  we will be exposed to credit losses from counter party non performance  however  we do not anticipate any such losses from these agreements  which are with a major financial institution 
the agreements will also expose us to interest rate risk should libor rise during the term of the agreements 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year for our cash and cash equivalents  held to maturity investments and significant debt obligations in thousands thereafter total assets cash  cash equivalents and held to maturity investments     weighted average interest rate liabilities fixed rate debt senior notes payable        weighted average interest rate the estimated fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and short term held to maturity investments approximate the principal amounts reflected above based on the generally short maturities of these financial instruments 
the estimated fair value of our long term held to maturity investments approximates the principal amounts above due to the relatively minor change in interest rates since their date of purchase 
rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of existing debt 
based on the borrowing rates currently available to us for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities  the fair value of the senior notes payable was approximately million as of december  and million as of december
