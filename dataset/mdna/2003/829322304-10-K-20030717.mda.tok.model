item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview restatement of financial statements in june  management revised its position on taxation of its subsidiary s income by the united states and by the hong kong tax authorities 
with regard to taxation in hong kong  the company s subsidiary had previously applied for a hong kong offshore claim income tax exemption based on the locality of profits of the hong kong subsidiary 
management believed that the exemption would be approved because the source of all profits of the hong kong subsidiary is from exporting to customers outside of hong kong 
accordingly  no provision for income taxes was provided in the consolidated financial statements as of march  and however  full disclosure was previously reflected in the audited financial statements for years ended march  and of the estimated amount that would be due to the hong kong tax authority should the exemption be denied 
management is continuing its exemption application process 
however  due to the extended period of time that the application has been outstanding  as well as management s reassessment of the probability that the application will be approved  management has determined to restate the and consolidated financial statements to provide for such taxes 
the effect of such restatement is to increase income tax expense by  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
however  the company can claim united states foreign tax credits in for these hong kong taxes  which is reflected in the final restated amounts 
with regard to united states taxation of foreign income  the company had originally taken the position that the foreign income of the hong kong subsidiary qualified for a deferral under the internal revenue code allowing for such income to be indefinitely deferred and not taxed in the united states until such income is repatriated 
full disclosure of the amount and nature of the indefinite deferral for fiscal year was reflected in the income tax footnote of the consolidated financial statements for that year 
the internal revenue code  regulations and case law regarding international income taxation is quite complex and subject to interpretation 
each case is determined based on the individual facts and circumstances 
due to certain inter company loans made in and  the profits previously considered to be indefinitely deferred became partially taxable as deemed dividends under section of the internal revenue code 
although certain arguments against the imposition of a deemed dividend may be asserted  management has determined to restate the fiscal year consolidated financial statements based on its reassessment of its original position 
the effect of such restatement is to increase income tax expense by  in fiscal year  which includes the utilization of the foreign tax credits referred to above 
the net effect of the above two adjustments is to decrease net income by  and  in fiscal and the net effect on net income per share is to decrease net income per share basic and diluted by and  respectively in fiscal and decrease net income per share basic and diluted by and  respectively in fiscal summary as restated  our income taxes increased from  in fiscal to  and from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and consequently our net income decreased correspondingly 
the restatement does not change our reported revenue  gross margin or pre tax income for fiscal or fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of the company s total revenues total revenues cost of sales operating expenses operating income other expenses  net income before taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss the percentages are based on our restated financial statements for fiscal and fiscal year ended march  compared to the year ended march  net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased to  compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  the company s growth was driven in large part by the addition of international sales in europe  asia  and australia 
this new market area is in its infant stage and the company expects continued future growth in this area 
we also generated  million or of our net sales from products sold under the mtv license in fiscal strong sales of the company s licensed merchandise and the introduction of new karaoke machines and music titles were also driving forces in our revenue growth for fiscal in fiscal  our sales of music increased to  or of sales as compared to  or in fiscal sales in fiscal were reduced by a charge against sales of million as a result of the end of a guaranteed margin agreement with a customer 
gross profit gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  was  or of sales as compared to  or of sales for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in gross margin compared to the prior year is due primarily to the following factors i increased sales from our hong kong subsidiary both to domestic and international customers  ii a write down of the value of inventory and iii a reduction of sales due to a guaranteed margin contract 
international sales were primarily in europe  canada and australia 
sales to international customers historically maintain lower selling prices  and thus a lower gross profit margins 
the main reason for this is that the sales are made to distributors in these countries and there are no additional variable expenses 
other variable expenses that are seen in conjunction with us sales are advertising allowances  handling charges  returns and commissions 
the company also undertook a revaluation of its current inventory 
it was determined that due to liquidation sales  inventory would be sold at a loss  therefore  a decrease in the value of these specific items was made 
the total amount of the provision for inventory was  in fiscal  the company entered into a guaranteed gross margin contract which completed on january  the company entered into an agreement with a retail customer in april whereby it guaranteed the customer a minimum gross margin of  from the sale of the company s products during the period from september  through january  under the agreement  the company agreed to reimburse the customer for the difference between the customer s gross margin on sales and the minimum guarantee 
as of the settlement date of the contract  january   the net loss on the agreement was  the company also realized the consignment sales made by this customer at january   in the amount of  as of march  the total amount due under this agreement has been paid 
operating expenses operating expenses were  or of total revenues in fiscal  up from  or of total revenues  in fiscal the primary factors that contributed to the increase of approximately million in operating expenses for the fiscal year are i increased advertising expenses of  due to increases with our outside firm  the production of a television commercial  as well as cooperative advertising with customers  which is variable based on the level of sales ii the increase in depreciation in the amount of  due to the addition of molds for new product additions for fiscal year  iii compensation expense in the amount of  due to the addition of key personnel in florida  in our california facility and at our hong kong subsidiary  iv increased freight and handling charges to customers  v expansion of the california warehouse and its associated expenses in the amount of  vi expansion of international smc s operations and its related expenses  in the amount of  vii increases in product development fees for development of future product  other increases in operating expenses were to selling expenses  which are considered variable 
these expenses are based directly on the level of sales and include royalty expenses  show expenses  and other selling expenses 
as a result of the merchandise license agreements and minimum guarantee requirements  the company expects royalty expense to increase in fiscal our advertising expense  as discussed in i above  increased  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to fiscal advertising expense consists of primarily two components co operative advertising and direct advertising expense 
co operative advertising is paid directly to the customer and is based directly on the amount of sales 
the customer has complete discretion as to the use of these funds 
co operative advertising expenses accounted for  of the increase in advertising expenses 
in fiscal  the company embarked on its first television advertising and continued with the use of print advertising  radio spots  sponsorships  promotions and other media 
the increased costs for our advertising firm were  over the prior year 
depreciation and amortization the company s depreciation and amortization expenses were  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses can be attributed to the company s acquisition of new molds and tooling for our expanded product line  as well as minimal costs for additional computer equipment and furniture for additional personnel 
other expenses other expenses were  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared with net expenses of  for the fiscal year ended march  our interest expense increased during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to our increased use of our credit facility with lasalle during this period 
prior to august  the company had cash reserves to fund operations and did not need to borrow on the revolving credit facility 
our interest income increased from  during the fiscal year to  during the fiscal year because we earned income on our cash balances held by our lender by investing in hour commercial paper investments 
the company expects interest expense to increase in fiscal due to the credit facility accruing interest at the default rate of prime plus at march  
income tax expense the company s tax expense is based on an aggregation of the taxes on earnings of its hong kong and domestic operations 
income tax rates in hong kong are approximately  while the statutory income tax rate in the united states is 
the company s effective tax rate in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal this decrease in the effective tax rate is a result of the company generating a pretax loss in the united states in fiscal  resulting in a tax benefit  as compared to pretax income in the united states in fiscal the company s future effective income tax rate will fluctuate based on the level of earnings of its hong kong and domestic operations 
net income as a result of the foregoing  the company s net income was  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to net income of  for fiscal year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased to  compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  the company s growth was driven by strong sales of the company s mtv licensed merchandise and the introduction of new karaoke machines and music titles 
we generated  million or of our net sales from products sold under the mtv license in fiscal our sales of music increased to  or of our net sales in fiscal compared with  or of our net sales in fiscal gross profit gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  was  or of sales compared to  or of sales for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in gross margin compared to the prior year is due to the realization of volume discounts by our largest customers 
this was offset to some degree by reduced prices that we paid our manufacturers for our karaoke machines because of our increased purchases 
operating expenses operating expenses increased to  or of sales  for the year ended march  from  or of sales  for the year ended march  this increase in operating expenses was primarily attributed to the increase in expenses associated with the opening of the company s hong kong office  the company s first advertising campaign and certain expenses which are considered variable as they relate directly to the level of sales 
in december  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  international smc  opened a hong kong office 
for the fiscal year ended march   this office incurred sg a expenses of approximately  compared to  in the prior year 
by opening this office  the company saved the manufacturers agency fees  which were paid on each shipment in prior years 
the hong kong office has fixed overhead expenses every month  as opposed to per shipment agency fees 
we realized the greatest benefit from our hong kong office in the third quarter of fiscal  when we purchased the largest amount of inventory 
our advertising expense increased to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  advertising expense consists of primarily two components co operative advertising and direct advertising expense 
co operative advertising is paid directly to the customer and is based directly on the amount of sales 
the customer has complete discretion as to the use of these funds 
co operative advertising expenses accounted for  of the increase in advertising expenses 
in fiscal  the company embarked on its first formal advertising campaign  which used print advertising  radio spots  sponsorships  promotions and other media 
the cost for this advertising campaign was approximately  and this is a direct advertising expense 
other expenses  termed variable expenses  contributed to the increase in operating expenses 
these expenses included royalty expense  sales commissions  warehouse expenses  and travel 
the largest increase can be seen in royalty expense  which increased approximately  over the prior year  primarily from the sale of items under the mtv licensing agreement 
our commissions payable to our independent sales representatives increased by  during fiscal  because of increased sales 
our warehouse related expenses also increased by  these expenses are due to the increased importing of the company s karaoke machines from hong kong 
compensation expenses increased  we grew from employees at march  to employees at march  depreciation and amortization the company s depreciation and amortization expenses were  for the fiscal year ended march   up from  in the prior year 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses can be attributed to the company s acquisition of new fixed assets during fiscal  which included computers  furniture and other equipment in all of the company s locations in florida  california and hong kong 
it also included the addition of new molds for our expanded product line 
the amortization expense includes the amortization of a fee paid to lasalle bank for our line of credit facility and the amortization of remaining deferred guarantee fees related to the factoring agreement we terminated in april other expenses other expenses were  for the fiscal year ended march  compared with net expenses of  for the fiscal year ended march  the company had a large decrease in these miscellaneous items primarily because of the elimination of factoring fees and a decrease in interest expense resulting in a net decrease of  the company terminated its factoring agreement in april and no longer incurs the fees and interest associated with it 
the company replaced the factoring agreement with a lower cost credit facility with lasalle business credit in april the company has also begun to generate income from royalty payments received in hong kong for the use of company owned molds by other parties 
income before income tax expense the company s income before income taxes increased to  for the fiscal year ended march   compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  this increase in profit is due primarily to the increase in sales 
income tax expense our income tax expense was restated for fiscal our accrual for income taxes is based on primarily two components i taxes of  which we are paying pursuant to section of the internal revenue code on an intercompany loans and ii taxes of  for international smc s business operations in hong kong 
the total income tax expense for fiscal was net income as a result of the foregoing  the company s net income increased to  for the fiscal year ended march   compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had cash on hand of  compared to  at march  our current liabilities increased to  as of march   compared to  at march  because we had minimal liquidity as of june  and had defaulted under a credit agreement with our commercial lender  we received a going concern qualification from our independent auditors for our financial statements for fiscal on march   we received a letter from lasalle informing us that we were in violation of a net worth covenant in our credit agreement 
in this letter  lasalle also advised us that we were in default under the credit agreement and that it could accelerate the payment of all liabilities due under this agreement at any time 
in june  lasalle amended the agreement through july  but did not waive the condition of default 
one of the conditions of this last amendment was that we obtain million in subordinated debt financing by july  as of july   we have obtained million in subordinated debt financing 
on or about july   certain officers  directors and an associate of a director  advanced million to the company 
we have not finalized the terms of this management loan  however  the company has immediate use and access to the million in funding 
it is presently expected that the loan will be a short term loan  which will be due on or before october  however  we have not yet determined the interest rate or if any compensation  such as warrants  will be awarded to the management investment group for their loan 
we are also in the process of finalizing a million loan from an outside investment group and hope to close this transaction as soon as possible 
there can be no assurance that this financing will be completed on time on the terms presently contemplated 
although the company has only raised million of the required million by the due date  the company believes that the commercial lender will continue to support the increased availability under the amendment 
we are currently in negotiations with lasalle to restructure the loan for the remainder of fiscal we hope that these negotiations will be successful and that a restructured loan agreement will be in place prior to august  however  we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful 
we entered into our credit facility with lasalle in april and have entered into several amendments subsequently 
we last amended the credit facility effective as of june  and it provides that the agreement expires on july  under the amended credit facility  lasalle bank will  at its discretion  advance up to of the company s eligible accounts receivable  plus up to of eligible inventory  plus us up to of commercial letters of credit issue by lasalle minus reserves as set forth in the loan documents 
the loan is secured by a first lien on all present and future assets of the company  except specific tooling located in china 
due to the increased level of inventory and accounts payable as of march   the company has an increased need for working capital 
as of march   the company had current assets of million  which consisted primarily of accounts receivable and inventory  and current liabilities of approximately million 
the most significant current liabilities include i approximately million in accounts payable  of which approximately million is amounts payable to the company s factories in china and ii million outstanding under the company s credit facility with lasalle bank 
over the past few months  the company has had discussions with its factories in china and they have indicated that they are willing to extend the payment dates for the company s obligations 
the company also has been negotiating with lasalle bank to increase the credit available to the company and has identified other sources of capital 
our hong kong subsidiary  international smc  has letters of credit facilities available to finance its inventory purchases 
these facilities are a million facility at hong kong shanghai banking corporation and a million facility at fortis bank 
international smc also has a short term loan with the hong kong shanghai banking corporation for million which expires in december additionally  one of our directors advanced  to international smc in march as of july   the balance of  is due on october  and bears interest at the rate of per annum 
in the event that we are not able to renegotiate an agreement with lasalle  we have considered alternative sources of financing  including but not limited to inventory and accounts receivable financing and other high risk financing such as venture capital funds 
without such financing  our ability to continue our operations is in significant doubt 
during fiscal  we plan on significantly decreasing our capital expenditures 
we currently expect to order million in new inventory for domestic stock 
during fiscal  we will attempt to liquidate the excess inventory from fiscal we believe this inventory is highly marketable and saleable  however  there can be no assurances that we will be able to liquidate this inventory during our upcoming fiscal year 
the company s commitments for debt and other contractual arrangements are summarized as follows years ending march  total merchandise license guarantee     property leases       equipment leases       we should be able to satisfy our liquidity requirements until july  by using credit that has been extended to us under our credit agreement with lasalle 
however  we are currently in default of the loan and lasalle could accelerate the loan at any time 
we hope that our renegotiations are successful  but can not guarantee that this will occur 
if we are not able to obtain adequate financing  we may not be able to continue as a going concern 
except for the foregoing  we do not have any present commitment that is likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
in addition  except for the company s need for additional capital to finance inventory purchases  the company knows of no trend  additional demand  event or uncertainty that will result in  or that is reasonably likely to result in  the company s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
cash flows used in operating activities were  during the fiscal year ended march  cash flows were used in operating activities primarily due to increases in accounts receivable in the amount of  and inventory in the amount of  during fiscal we purchased a higher level of inventory in fiscal as we had anticipated a higher demand for our products 
cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended march  was  cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from the purchase of fixed assets in the amount of  the purchase of fixed assets consists primarily of the tooling and molds required for production of new machines for this fiscal year 
tooling and molds are depreciated over three years 
cash flows provided by financing activities were  during the fiscal year ended march  this consisted of proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options in the amount of  the company also had a short term loan with a director in the amount of  during fiscal the remainder of cash provided from financing activities was provided by net borrowings on the credit line at lasalle national bank in the amount of  primarily for the financing of the inventory buildup 
exchange rates we sell all of our products in us dollars and pay for all of our manufacturing costs in either us or hong kong dollars 
operating expenses of the hong kong office are paid in hong kong dollars 
we cannot assure you that the exchange rate fluctuations between the united states and hong kong currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
seasonal and quarterly results historically  the company s operations have been seasonal  with the highest net sales occurring in the second and third quarters reflecting increased orders for equipment and music merchandise during the christmas selling months and to a lesser extent the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year 
sales in the company s fiscal second and third quarter  combined  accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal the company s results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of orders placed and shipped to customers  as well as other factors 
the fulfillment of orders can therefore significantly affect results of operations on a quarter to quarter basis 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company has historically passed any price increases on to its customers since prices charged by the company are generally not fixed by long term contracts 
critical accounting policies the us securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the management of the company believes that a high degree of judgment or complexitiy is involved in the following areas collectibility of accounts receivable 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of its customers  current economic conditions and historical information  and  in the opinion of management  is believed to be an amount sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
management sets reserves for customers in bankruptcy and other reserves based upon historical collection experience 
should business conditions deteriorate or any major customer default on its obligations to the company  this allowance may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact on operations 
reserves on inventories 
the company establishes a reserve on inventory based on the expected net realizable value of inventory on an item by item basis when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of an inventory item falls below its original cost 
a charge to cost of sales results when the estimated net realizable value of specific inventory items declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for such declines in value 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing the company s provision for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
at march  and  the company had net deferred tax assets of million and thousand  respectively 
management evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts its valuation allowance as necessary 
there is no related valuation allowance at march  and the company s hong kong subsidiary has applied for an exemption of income tax in hong kong 
therefore  no taxes have been expensed or provided for at the subsidiary level 
although no decision has been reached by the governing body  the us parent company has reached the decision to provide for the possibility that the exemption could be denied and accordingly has recorded a provision in fiscal   and the company may be deemed to have constructively repatriated approximately million  million and from its foreign operations in  and  respectively 
accordingly  these earnings were taxed as a deemed dividend based on us statutory rates 
no provision has been made for us taxes on the remaining undistributed earnings of the company s foreign subsidiaries of approximately million at march  and million at march   as it is anticipated that such earnings would be permanently reinvested in their respective operations in accordance with section of the internal revenue code 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
other estimates 
the company makes other estimates in the ordinary course of business relating to sales returns and allowances  warranty reserves  and reserves for promotional incentives 
historically  past changes to these estimates have not had a material impact on our financial condition 
however  circumstances could change which may alter future expectations 
risk factors that may affect future results and market price of stock this annual report contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of issues and uncertainties such as those listed below  which  among others  should be considered in evaluating the company s financial outlook 
we received a going concern uncertainty paragraph from our independent auditors our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended march  were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which contemplates continuation of the company as a going concern 
our independent auditors have issued a report dated june  except for note  as to which the date is july  and note  as to which the date is july  stating that our default under our credit agreement with lasalle raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have minimal liquidity as of june   the date of the audit report  and our commercial lender has declared us in default under the terms of our credit agreement  which expires on july  for these reasons  our independent auditors were concerned about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we are attempting to restructure our credit agreement with our lender 
based upon cash flow projections  the company believes the anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance the company s operating needs until inventory is sold and the receivables subsequently collected  provided the bank does not call the loan 
however  there can be no assurances that we will achieve our forecasted results and that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance our operating needs until our inventory is sold 
we are also seeking other sources of long and short term capital 
because we can give no assurance that we can achieve any of the foregoing  there is substantial uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern 
because we have a going concern certainty paragraph  it may be more difficult for us to raise capital 
we have significant working capital needs which are subject to the uncertainty of additional financing if we are not able to restructure our credit agreement with our commercial lender by july   we will need to seek additional funds to operate our business 
although we have been looking for alternative sources of capital in addition to our credit line with our commercial lender  we are not certain that we will be able to locate and secure such additional financing on a timely basis and on terms that are acceptable to the company 
we are also trying to sell our excess inventory to provide us with more cash for operations 
if we do not have adequate financing  it will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition and we may need to change our business strategy or reduce our operations 
if we have a severe shortage of working capital  we may not be able to continue our business operations and may be required to file a petition for chapter or enter into some liquidation or reorganization proceeding 
in addition  any issuance of additional equity securities will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders and issuance of debt securities may increase the perceived risk of investing in us 
we are currently in default under our credit agreement with our commercial lender on march   we received a letter from lasalle informing us that we were in breach of our credit agreement as a result of our failure to maintain the minimum tangible net worth requirement 
in this letter  lasalle also advised us that it could accelerate the payment of all liabilities due under the credit agreement at any time 
additionally  we have not satisfied a requirement in the last amendment to our credit agreement that we obtain million in subordinated debt financing by  as of july   lasalle has not filed a lawsuit against us to accelerate the payment of any liabilities due under the credit agreement 
if lasalle were to exercises its right to foreclose on our assets  primarily our accounts receivable and inventory  this action might disrupt our current business operations 
if lasalle were to liquidate a significant amount of our inventory at one time  it might be more difficult for us to place inventory with other retailers 
we would also need to find financing from a third party and there are no assurances that we will be able to do so 
we are named as a defendant in several class action lawsuits from july  through july   six securities class action lawsuits were filed against our company and certain of our officers and directors in the united states district court for the southern district of florida on behalf of all persons who purchased the singing machine s securities during the various class action periods specified in the complaints 
while the specific factual allegations vary slightly in each case  the complaints generally allege that defendants falsely represented the singing machine s financial results during the relevant class periods 
while we believe that the allegations in the complaint are without merit  an unfavorable resolution of pending litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of the singing machine s management regardless of the outcome 
there can be no assurance that the singing machine will be able to achieve a favorable settlement of pending litigation or obtain a favorable resolution of litigation if it is not settled 
in addition  current litigation could lead to increased costs or interruptions of normal business operations of the singing machine 
we rely on sales to a limited number of key customers  which account for a large portion of our net sales as a percentage of total revenues  our net sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal period ended march   and were approximately  and respectively 
in fiscal  three major customers accounted for  and of our net sales 
although we have long established relationships with many of our customers  we do not have long term contractual arrangements with any of them 
a substantial reduction in or termination of orders from any of our largest customers could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  pressure by large customers seeking price reductions  financial incentives  changes in other terms of sale or requesting that we bear the risks and the cost of carrying inventory  such as consignment agreements  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has significantly broadened its base of customers  decreasing the amount of reliance on their largest customers 
if one or more of our major customers were to cease doing business with us  significantly reduced the amount of their purchases from us or returned substantial amounts of our products  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may have significant returns  markdowns and purchase order cancellations as is customary in the consumer electronics industry  the company has  on occasion  i permitted certain customers to return slow moving items for credit  ii provided price protection to certain customers by making price reductions effective as to certain products then held by customers in inventory and ii accepted customer cancellations of purchase orders issued to the company 
the company expects that it will continue to be required to make such accommodations in the future 
any significant increase in the amount of returns  markdowns or purchaser order cancellations could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
our licensing agreements are important to our business we value all of our merchandise license agreements and feel that if any of them were to be terminated or fail to be renewed  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our license with mtv is particular important to our business 
we generated  million or of our net sales from products sold under the mtv license in fiscal however  management believes that our company has developed a strong brand name in the karaoke industry and that it will be able to continue to develop and grow its business  even if the merchandise license agreements did not exist 
inventory management and consignment arrangements because of our reliance on manufacturers in asia for our machine production  our production lead times are relatively long 
therefore  we must commit to production in advance of customers orders 
if we fail to forecast customers or consumer demand accurately we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or liquidating excess inventories  or may find that customers are canceling orders or returning products 
distribution difficulties may have an adverse effect on our business by increasing the amount of inventory and the cost of storing inventory 
as of march   we had million in inventory 
we will attempt to liquidate this excess inventory during fiscal we believe that this entire inventory is highly marketable and saleable  however  there can be no assurances that we will be able to liquidate this inventory during our upcoming fiscal year 
as of march   we had one remaining consignment agreement with a customer 
only one product line is included in this consignment agreement  our music 
the company does not believe that any changes to this arrangement will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to compete and maintain our niche in the entertainment industry could hurt our business the business in which we are engaged is highly competitive 
our major competitors for karaoke machines and related products are craig  curtis  grand prix and memorex 
we believe that competition for karaoke machines is based primarily on price  product features  reputation  delivery times  and customer support 
our primary competitors for producing karaoke music are pocket songs  sybersound  uav and sound choice 
we believe that competition for karaoke music is based primarily on popularity of song titles  price  reputation  and delivery times 
to the extent that we lower prices for to attempt to enhance or retain market share  we may adversely impact our operating margins 
conversely  if we opt not to match competitor s price reductions we may lose market share  resulting in decreased volume and revenue 
we believe that our new product introductions and enhancements of existing products are material factors for our continued growth and profitability 
in fiscal  we produced new lines of karaoke machines 
however  many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing and operating resources than we have 
no assurance can be given that we will continue to be successful in introducing new products or further enhancing our existing products 
in addition  we must compete with all the other existing forms of entertainment including  but not limited to motion pictures  video arcade games  home video games  theme parks  nightclubs  television and prerecorded tapes  cd s and video cassettes 
we are subject to seasonality  which is affected by various economic conditions and changes resulting in fluctuations in quarterly results sales of consumer electronics and toy products in the retail channel are highly seasonal  causing the substantial majority of our sales to occur during the second quarter ended september and the third quarter ended december sales in our second and third quarter  combined  accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal the seasonal pattern of sales in the retail channel requires significant use of our working capital to manufacture and carry inventory in anticipation of the holiday season  as well as early and accurate forecasting of holiday sales 
failure to predict accurately and respond appropriately to consumer demand on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations  or any disruption of consumer buying habits during their key period  would harm our business and operating results 
in fiscal  we overestimated the demand for our product and held million of inventory as of march  our increased inventory levels led to a shortage in our available working capital and our current liquidity crisis 
additional factors that can cause our sales and operating results to vary significantly from period to period include  among others  the mix of products  fluctuating market demand  price competition  new product introductions by competitors  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  disruptions in delivery of components  political instability  general economic conditions  and the other considerations described in this section entitled risk factors 
a disruption in the operation of our warehouse centers in california and florida would impact our ability to delivery merchandise to our stores  which could adversely impact our revenues and harm our business and financial results a significant amount of our merchandise is shipped to our customers from one of our three warehouses  which are located in compton  california  rancho dominguez  california and coconut creek  florida 
events such as fire or other catastrophic events  any malfunction or disruption of our centralized information systems or shipping problems may result in delays or disruptions in the timely distribution of merchandise to our customers  which could adversely impact our revenues and our business and financial results 
our business operations could be disrupted if there are labor problems on the west coast during fiscal  approximately of our sales were domestic sales  which were made from our warehouses in california and florida 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the dock strike on the west coast affected sales of two of our karaoke products and we estimate that we lost between and million in orders because we couldn t get the containers of these products off the pier 
if another strike or work slow down were to occur and we do not have a sufficient level of inventory  a strike or work slow down would result in increased costs to our company and may reduce our profitability 
our products are shipped from china and any disruption of shipping could harm our business we rely principally on four contract ocean carriers to ship virtually all of the products that we import to our warehouse facility in compton  california 
retailers that take delivery of our products in china rely on a variety of carriers to import those products 
any disruptions in shipping  whether in california or china  caused by labor strikes  other labor disputes  terrorism  and international incidents or otherwise could significantly harm our business and reputation 
we may not be able to sustain or manage our rapid growth we experienced rapid growth in net sales and net income over the last few years 
our net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  our net income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal as a result  comparing our period to period operating results may not be meaningful  and results of operations from prior periods may not be indicative of future results 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience growth in  or maintain our present level of  net sales or net income 
our growth strategy calls for us to continuously develop and diversify our karaoke products by i developing new and innovative karaoke machines and music products  ii entering into additional license agreements iii expanding into international markets  iv developing new retail customers in the united states and v obtaining additional financing 
our growth strategy will place additional demands on our management  operational capacity and financial resources and systems 
to effectively manage future growth  we must continue to expand our operational  financial and management information systems and train  motivate and manage our work force 
in addition  implementation of our growth strategy is subject to risks beyond our control  including competition  market acceptance of new products  changes in economic conditions  our ability to maintain our licensing agreements with mtv and nickelodeon and our ability to finance increased levels of accounts receivable and inventory necessary to support our sales growth  if any 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our growth strategy will be implemented successfully 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile market prices of the securities of companies in the toy and entertainment industry are often volatile 
the market prices of our common stock may be affected by many factors  including our ability to resolve our present liquidity crisis  by extending our credit facility with lasalle or by finding alternative sources of financing  our ability to resell our excess inventory as of march   unpredictable consumer preferences and spending trends  the actions of our customers and competitors including new product line announcements and introduction  changes in our pricing policies  the pricing policies of our competitors and general pricing trends in the consumer and electronics and toy markets  regulations affecting our manufacturing operations in china  other factors affecting the entertainment and consumer electronics industries in general  and sales of our common stock into the public market 
in addition  the stock market periodically has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations which may have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
our manufacturing operations are located in the people s republic of china  subjecting us to risks common in international operations we are dependent upon six factories in the people s republic of china to manufacture all of our electronic products 
our arrangements with these factories are subject to the risks of doing business abroad  such as import duties  trade restrictions  work stoppages  and foreign currency fluctuations  limitations on the repatriation of earnings  political instability  and other factors  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
furthermore  we have limited control over the manufacturing processes themselves 
as a result  any difficulties encountered by the third party manufacturers that result in product defects  production delays  cost overruns or the inability to fulfill orders on a timely basis could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the loss of any one or more of our manufacturers would not have a long term material adverse effect on us because other manufacturers with whom we do business would be able to increase production to fulfill our requirements 
however  the loss of certain of our manufacturers  could  in the short term  adversely affect our business until alternative supply arrangements were secured 
we depend on third party suppliers for parts for our karaoke machines and related products  and if we cannot obtain supplies as needed  our operations will be severely damaged our growth and ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our capability to obtain timely deliveries of karaoke machines and our electronic products 
we rely on third party suppliers to produce the parts and materials we use to manufacture and produce these products 
if our suppliers are unable to provide our factories with the parts and supplies  we will be unable to produce our products 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to purchase the parts we need at reasonable prices or in a timely fashion 
in the last several years  there have been shortages of certain chips that we use in our karaoke machines 
we  however  have anticipated this shortage and have made commitments to our factories to purchase chips in advance 
if we are unable to anticipate any shortages of parts and materials in the future  we may experience severe production problems  which would impact our sales 
consumer discretionary spending may affect karaoke purchases and is affected by various economic conditions and changes our business and financial performance may be damaged more than most companies by adverse financial conditions affecting our business or by a general weakening of the economy 
purchases of karaoke machines and music are considered discretionary for consumers 
our success will therefore be influenced by a number of economic factors affecting discretionary and consumer spending  such as employment levels  business  interest rates  and taxation rates  all of which are not under our control 
adverse economic changes affecting these factors may restrict consumer spending and thereby adversely affect our growth and profitability 
we may be infringing upon the copyrights of third parties each song in our catalog is licensed to us for specific uses 
because of the numerous variations in each of our licenses for copyrighted music  there can be no assurance that we have complied with scope of each of our licenses and that our suppliers have complied with these licenses 
additionally  third parties over whom we exercise no control may use our sound recordings in such a way that is contrary to our license agreement and by violating our license agreement we may be liable for contributory copyright infringement 
any infringement claims may have a negative effect on our ability to sell products 
we have significant reliance on large retailers  which are subject to changes in the economy we sell products to retailers  including department stores  lifestyle merchants  direct mail retailers  which are catalogs and showrooms  national chains  specialty stores  and warehouse clubs 
certain of such retailers have engaged in leveraged buyouts or transactions in which they incurred a significant amount of debt  and some are currently operating under the protection of bankruptcy laws 
despite the difficulties experienced by retailers in recent years  we have not suffered significant credit losses to date 
deterioration in the financial condition of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our future profitability 
our business operations could be significantly disrupted if we lose members of our management team our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive officers  both individually and as a group 
although we have entered into employment contracts with edward steele  our chief executive officer  yi ping 
chan  our chief operating officer  april green  our chief financial officer and jack dromgold  our executive vice president of sales and marketing  the loss of the services of any of these individuals could prevent us from executing our business strategy 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to find appropriate replacements for edward steele or jack dromgold  if the need should arise  and any loss or interruption of mr 
steele or mr 
dromgold s services could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our obligation to make severance payments could prevent or delay takeovers 
our employment agreements with eddie steele  yi ping chan  april green and jack dromgold require us  under certain conditions  to make substantial severance payments to them if they resign after a change of control 
these provisions could delay or impede a merger  tender  offer or other transaction resulting in a change in control of the company  even if such a transaction would have significant benefits to our shareholders 
as a result  these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we may be subject to claims from third parties for unauthorized use of their proprietary technology  copyrights or trade secrets we believe that we independently developed the technology used in our electronic and audio software products and that it does not infringe on the proprietary rights  copyrights or trade secrets of others 
however  we cannot assure you that we have not infringed on the proprietary rights of third parties or those third parties will not make infringement violation claims against us 
any infringement claims may have a negative effect on our ability to manufacture our products 
your investment may be diluted if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  your percentage ownership in our equity will be reduced 
also  you may experience additional dilution in net book value per share  and these equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of yours 
risks associated with our capital structure future sales of our common stock held by current stockholders may depress our stock price as of march   there were  shares of our common stock outstanding 
we have filed two registration statements registering an aggregate  of shares of our common stock a registration statement on form s to registering the sale of  shares underlying options granted under our stock option plan and a registration statement on form s to register  shares of our common stock underlying options granted under our year stock option plan 
the market price of our common stock could drop due to the sale of large number of shares of our common stock  such as the shares sold pursuant to the registration statements or under rule  or the perception that these sales could occur 
adverse effect on stock price from future issuances of additional shares our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  million shares of common stock 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding and an aggregate of  outstanding options and warrants 
as such  our board of directors has the power  without stockholder approval  to issue up to  shares of common stock 
any issuance of additional shares of common stock  whether by us to new stockholders or the exercise of outstanding warrants or options  may result in a reduction of the book value or market price of our outstanding common stock 
issuance of additional shares will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of our then existing stockholders 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make it difficult for a third party to acquire our company and could depress the price of our common stock 
delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation include authorizing our board of directors to issue additional preferred stock  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
we are also subject to certain provisions of delaware law that could delay  deter or prevent us from entering into an acquisition  including the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder unless specific conditions are met 
the existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may deprive you of an opportunity to sell your shares at a premium over prevailing prices 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or remain vulnerable to an economic downturn  such as china 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from companies in china  and  therefore  we are subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while we believe that  if such an event were to occur we would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at competitive prices  we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of march   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize market risk 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt under our credit facility with lasalle 
under our credit facility  our interest rate is lasalle s prime rate plus of per annum current interest rate 
as of march   we are accruing interest at the default rate  which is the current interest rate under the credit agreement plus per annum 
we do not believe that near term changes in the interest rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows 
foreign currency risk we have a wholly owned subsidiary in hong kong 
sales by these operations made on a fob china or hong kong basis are dominated in us dollars 
however  purchases of inventory and hong kong operating expenses are typically denominated in hong kong dollars  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong kong dollar us dollar exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
we do not believe that near term changes in the exchange rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows  and therefore  we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we cannot assure you that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of the hong kong dollar
