approximately  of these payments were made to km logistics prior to fiscal year end

in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  a full valuation allowance was recorded for this benefit as it could not be carried back to recover taxes paid and will not be offset by the reversal of future taxable differences 
the company s liquidity situation at november  also provided significant negative evidence regarding its ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize this benefit 
liquidity and capital resources prior to december   the company s term debt agreements had contained various covenants specifying certain financial requirements  including minimum tangible net worth  fixed charge and ebitda coverage ratios  working capital and maximum ratio of total liabilities to net worth 
in addition  the revolving working capital credit facility and the real estate term loan contain an acceleration provision  which can be triggered if the lender determines that an event of default has occurred 
as of each quarter end from september  through august   the company had been in violation of certain covenants of its term debt facility and therefore  due to a cross default provision  the company had not been in compliance with a covenant under its revolving working capital credit facility and real estate term loan 
as a result  all of the company s term loans except for that of its spanish subsidiary had been classified as current liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet at the end of each fiscal quarter end 
in addition  during july  the company received a demand from its primary term debt lender for the payment of their outstanding loan balances in the amount of  which represented the total of all future payments and accumulated late fees  and a demand letter from a smaller equipment lender for approximately  of payments due 
during  the company negotiated with these lenders and  in november   reached formal agreement to obtain relief from their demands and to restructure existing term debt facilities 
under the new arrangements  the term debt lenders accepted significantly reduced principal payments over the next three years  eliminated financial covenants  waived existing defaults and rescinded demands for accelerated payment  in return for enhanced collateral positions 
as of november   the company had approximately  of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving line of credit with its primary working capital lender  after consideration of collateral limitations 
the company s working capital position improved from a negative  at november  to a negative  at november   due to an  decrease in the current portion of long term borrowings  a  decrease in accounts payable  a  increase in inventory  a  increase in prepaid and other current assets  a  decrease in short term debt  a  decrease in accrued expenses and a  increase in cash  partially offset by a  decrease in accounts receivable 
during the second quarter of  the company received a funding waiver from the internal revenue service for the  payment due to its defined benefit plan for the year ended november   conditioned on the company satisfying the minimum funding requirements for the plan years ending november  and november  the company had notified the pension benefit guarantee corporation that the company intended to make the  contribution for the plan year ending november  by the final due date of august   instead of on a quarterly basis 
during the first quarter of  the company requested a partial funding waiver from the internal revenue service for  of the  payment due for the plan year ending november  the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the negative working capital position of  the funding requirement for the defined benefit plan of  for the plan year ending november   the lack of sales growth  and the overall risks associated with the fiscal plan may indicate that the company will be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
it is management s belief that cash flows generated from operations and available incremental borrowings will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs during fiscal management has also identified a number of additional expense reductions possible in  including the deferral of certain planned personnel replacements or additions  the deferral of certain planned marketing expenses  reduced product costs through materials substitutions  and decreased usage of certain operating supplies 
although management expects to be able to accomplish its business and financing plans  there is no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the company s plans depend upon many factors 
failure to accomplish these plans could have an adverse impact on the company s liquidity  financial position  and ability to continue operations

a summary of the company s cash requirements related to its outstanding long term debt and future minimum lease payments is as follows operating lease fiscal year long term debt commitments total thereafter   total    critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s subjective judgments 
these policies relate to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  inventory reserves  provision for doubtful accounts receivable and impairment of long lived assets 
recognition of a deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax loss or credit carryforward 
the company has taken a full valuation allowance for this tax benefit in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes 
should the company s liquidity situation improve  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be increased and could result in a credit to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value  based upon assumptions about future demand and market pricing 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company periodically reviews the aging of accounts receivable to identify potentially uncollectible accounts and establishes a reserve based on experience and discussion with customers 
actual write offs could differ from bad debt reserves 
the company reviews long lived assets annually or whenever events of circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair value based on the best information available to the company 
environmental the company has been named as a potentially responsible party by the united states environmental protection agency in two ongoing claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla 
the company has also received notices of responsibility under massachusetts general laws chapter e on two sites in massachusetts 
the company has accrued  as of november  to cover future environmental expenditures related to these claims  which is net of  payments made to date 
the accrual represents the company s estimate of the remaining remediation costs based upon the best information currently available 
actual future costs may be different from the amount accrued for as of november  and may be affected by various factors  including future testing  the remediation alternatives taken at the sites  and actual cleanup costs 
the final remediation costs could also be subject to adjustment because of the long term nature of the cases  legislative changes  insurance coverage  joint and several liability provisions of cercla  and the company s ability to successfully negotiate an outcome similar to its previous experience in these matters 
the company has also received notices of responsibility under massachusetts general laws chapter e on three sites at the company s facilities in canton  massachusetts 
in all of these cases  the company has taken a variety of actions towards the ultimate cleanup  depending upon the status of each of the sites 
these activities include the retention of an independent licensed site professional  investigation  assessment  containment  and remediation

 and technical corrections 
fas rescinds fas  reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  fas  accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers  and fas an amendment of fas  extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
fas eliminates the requirement that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of the related income tax effect 
however  an entity would not be prohibited from classifying such gains and losses as extraordinary items so long as they are both unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence 
this provision will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fas also amends fas  accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
the amendment to fas and other technical amendments will be effective for all transactions occurring and financial statements issued after may  the company is in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of fas in june  the fasb issued statement no 
fas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which eliminates emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
fas applies to costs associated with an exit activity including a termination benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract one time termination benefit  b costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease  and c costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
fas requires that these liabilities be recognized and measured initially at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
if fair value cannot be reasonably estimated  the liability shall be recognized initially in the period in which fair value can be reasonably estimated 
the provisions on fas will be effective for the company prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company is in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of fas in november  the fasb issued interpretation no

  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 

fin clarifies the requirements of the fasb statement no 
fas  accounting for contingencies  relating to a guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
many guarantees are embedded in purchase or sales agreements  service contracts  joint venture agreements  or other commercial agreements and the guarantor in many of those arrangements does not receive separately identifiable up front payment eg  a premium for issuing the guarantee 
prior to fin  many guarantors did not recognize an initial liability for such embedded guarantees 
now  however  they are required to recognize a liability at fair value upon issuance of the guarantees  regardless of whether they receive a separate premium for doing so 
the interpretation is intended to improve the comparability of financial reporting by requiring identical accounting for guarantees issued with a separately identified premium and guarantees issued without a separately identified premium 
for guarantees issued or modified after december   significant new disclosure requirements are effective beginning with calendar year end financial statements  including a requirement to disclose the maximum amount of future payments that an entity might need to make under a guarantee and a reconciliation of during the period in their product warranty liabilities

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas fas 
as the title of the standard implies  it is fairly limited in its scope  however it will have implications for all entities that issue stock based compensation to their employees 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
this statement permits two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the preferable method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
both of those methods avoid the ramp up effect arising from prospective application of the fair value based method 
in addition  to address concerns raised by some constituents about the lack of comparability caused by multiple transition methods  this statement does not permit the use of the original statement prospective method of transition for changes to the fair value based method made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company is in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of fas safe harbor statement certain statements in this report  in the company s press releases and in oral statements made by or with the approval of an authorized executive officer of the company may constitute forward looking statements as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of these may include statements projecting  forecasting or estimating company performance and industry trends 
the achievement of the projections  forecasts or estimates is subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected  forecast or estimated 
the applicable risks and uncertainties include general economic and industry conditions that affect all international businesses  as well as matters that are specific to the company and the markets it serves 
general risks that may impact the achievement of such forecast include compliance with new laws and regulations  significant raw material price fluctuations  changes in interest rates  currency exchange rate fluctuations  limits on the repatriation of funds and political uncertainty 
specific risks to the company include risk of recession in the economies and or markets in which its products are sold  risk of the company s working capital lender and real estate lender demanding payment of outstanding balances  risk of not receiving waiver from the government on the required contribution into the pension plan  the concentration of a substantial percentage of the company s sales with a few major automotive customers  cost of raw materials  and pricing pressures from competitors and customers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at november   the carrying value of company s debt totaled million which approximated its fair value 
this debt includes amounts at both fixed and variable interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at november   the company had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the unrealized fair market value of fixed rate debt by approximately  the earnings and cash flows impact for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately  holding other variables constant
