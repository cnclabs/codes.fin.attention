item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business segments us global investors  inc company or us global  with principal operations located in san antonio  texas  manages two business segments the company offers a broad range of investment management products and services to meet the needs of individual and institutional investors  and the company invests for its own account in an effort to add growth and value to its cash position 
the company generates substantially all its operating revenues from the investment management of products and services for the us global investors funds usgif and us global accolade funds usgaf 
notwithstanding the fact that the company generates the majority of its revenues from this segment  the company holds a significant amount of its total assets in investments 
as of june   the company held approximately million in investments  comprising of its total assets 
the following is a brief discussion of the company s two business segments 
investment management products and services the company generates substantially all of its operating revenues from managing and servicing usgif and usgaf 
these revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under its management 
fluctuations in the markets and investor sentiment directly impact the funds asset levels  thereby affecting income and results of operations 
during fiscal year  total average assets under management decreased to billion primarily due to shareholder redemptions in the us government securities savings fund  which reflects a current industry trend as investors are moving away from lower yielding money market funds and are seeking investment products with higher yields 
average assets under management dollars in millions change change usgif money market usgif other usgif total    usgaf total     investment activities management believes it can more effectively manage the company s cash position by broadening the types of investments used in cash management 
management attempts to maximize the company s return on its cash position by using a diversified venture capital approach to investing 
strategically  management invests in early stage or start up businesses seeking initial financing and more mature businesses in need of capital for expansion  acquisitions  management buyouts  or recapitalization 
management has reduced these activities due to poor market conditions 
as of june  and  the company held approximately and million  respectively  in investments other than usgif money market mutual fund shares 
investment income from the company s investments includes realized gains and losses  unrealized gains and losses on trading securities  other than temporary impairments on available for sale securities  and dividend and interest income 
this source of revenue does not remain at a consistent level and is dependent on market fluctuations  the company s ability to participate in investment opportunities  and timing of transactions 
for fiscal years   and  the company had net realized gains losses of approximately   and  respectively 
the company expects that gains or losses will continue to fluctuate in the future  as fluctuations in the market value of the company s investments will affect the amounts of such gains or losses 
consolidated results of operations the following is a discussion of the consolidated results of operations of the company and a more detailed discussion of the company s revenues and expenses

these items were offset by recognition of an other than temporary impairment on available for sale securities of  in addition  declines in investment advisory and transfer agent fees were partially offset by expense reductions during the year 
year ended june   compared with year ended june  the company posted a net after tax loss of  loss per share for the year ended june   compared with a net after tax loss of  loss per share for the year ended june  the decease in net loss for from was principally due to the company s reduction of the overall expense reimbursement levels of its funds 
the company also realigned its cost structure in order to better cope with declining fund asset levels due to adverse market conditions 
however  offsetting these activities was a decline in both investment advisory and transfer agent revenues  as well as other ancillary operations

investment advisory fees  the largest component of the company s revenues  are calculated as a percentage ranging from to of average net assets and are paid monthly 
the company has agreed to waive its fee revenues and or pay expenses for certain usgif funds through june   for purposes of enhancing the funds competitive market positions  in particular the money market and fixed income funds 
the aggregate amount of fees waived and expenses born by the company totaled   and  in   and  respectively 
the company expects to continue to waive fees and or pay for fund expenses if market and economic conditions warrant 
however  subject to the company s commitment to certain funds with respect to fee waivers and expense limitations  the company may reduce the amount of fund expenses it is bearing 
net investment advisory fees are also affected by changes in assets under management  including market appreciation or depreciation  the addition of new client accounts or client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts  withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts  exchanges of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures  and the amount of fees voluntarily reimbursed 
the decrease in net advisory fees in fiscal year of approximately  or  over fiscal year was largely due to continued shareholder redemptions in the u 
s 
government securities savings fund 
market trends throughout the year  as reflected in investment company institute ici mutual fund money flow data  have affected the investment industry as a whole  as well as the company 
money market funds have continued to suffer net outflows over the last twelve months during which time money market yields have declined to the lowest levels in approximately years 
as money market investors seek alternative short term investments with higher yields  along with equity investors rebalancing their portfolios  there was an increase in bond fund cash flows 
in addition  gold related investments have performed relatively well during this period and valuations have increased as a result of gold bullion reaching a seven year high of per ounce during the period 
the decrease in net advisory fees in fiscal year of approximately  or  over fiscal year was largely due to market declines and shareholder redemptions in the company s equity funds  particularly the bonnel growth fund and the all american equity fund 
the company also experienced net redemptions in its us government securities savings fund 
again  this is an industry trend as yields had fallen significantly and money market funds had lost ground to other higher yielding products 
transfer agent fees

the company receives  as compensation for services rendered as transfer agent  an annual fee per account and is reimbursed for out of pocket expenses associated with processing shareholder information 
transfer agent fees are therefore affected by the number of client accounts 
the decrease in transfer agent fees in fiscal year of approximately  or  over fiscal year is primarily a result of a decrease in mutual fund shareholder accounts from  to  the company has continued to see a decline in its number of accounts serviced as many smaller accounts in the funds continue to close 
the company instituted a small account fee in january for shareholders with low account balances in the funds 
market practices in the mutual fund industry typically demand that low fund expense ratios are necessary in order to remain competitive 
as a result of the small account fees  which serve to reduce expenses borne by the funds  the gold funds have realized significant improvements in their expense ratios 
however  the company has realized a large drop in accounts under management  which has resulted in a decline in transfer agent fees for the company 
also  as a result of the small account fee  the company expects to have a continued trend in client account closures for calendar year the company expects that these small account closures  though painful in the short term  will result in improved long term fund profitability and lower expense ratios for its equity funds  improving their competitive positioning against their respective peer groups 
the decrease in fees in fiscal year  as compared with fiscal year  is a result of a decrease in mutual fund shareholder accounts from  to  custodial and administrative fees 
security trust financial company stfc  a wholly owned state chartered trust company  provided custodial and or trustee services for iras and other retirement plans administered by the company 
the custodial fees were previously paid to stfc at calendar year end upon separate invoice to the customer  not the funds 
effective january   us global administrators  inc usga  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  began providing qualified plan administration and record keeping services for existing k clients  which services were previously offered by stfc 
the administrative fees were paid to usga on a quarterly basis by its clients 
usga ceased revenue generating operations on may  stfc continued to collect its custodial fees through may   at which time a majority of these fees transferred to usgi 
both companies were liquidated during fiscal year custodial and administrative fees remained relatively stable in fiscal year at  after declines were realized in prior years 
custodial and administrative fees decreased approximately  or  in fiscal year as a result of the discontinuation of usga s k servicing operations  a decline in the number of custodial accounts administered  and a revenue sharing agreement with the entity usgi contracted to provide custodial services for these accounts 
mailing services 
a b mailers  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  provides mail handling services to various entities 
some of a b mailers primary customers include the company  in connection with its efforts to promote the funds  and usgif and usgaf in fulfilling communications services with fund shareholders 
each service is priced separately 
mailing service fees increased by  or  during fiscal year the decrease in mailing service fees of approximately  or  for fiscal year was a result of an adjustment to revenues to reflect mailing volumes 
private client advisory fees

the increase in fees of  from to reflects an entire year of fees earned during the current fiscal year as compared to one month of fees earned in the prior fiscal year 
in addition  securities in this portfolio realized a significant increase in market value during the year 
expenses dollars in thousands change change employee compensation and     benefits general and administrative     advertising depreciation interest total     employee compensation and benefits

employee compensation and benefits decreased in fiscal year over fiscal year by  or  which was also due to staff reductions 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  in fiscal year over fiscal year this was primarily a result of a write off of  associated with a receivable from an insurance carrier during fiscal year additionally  the cost of defending a lawsuit reached reimbursable levels on the company s insurance policy during late fiscal prior to this  all costs had been expensed as the company paid the deductible on this claim 
these items were offset by increases in insurance expenses  sub advisory fees  and omnibus account fees 
insurance costs have continued to rise since september   as the insurance industry has continued to pass through its increasing costs of coverage 
sub advisory fees increased as a result of strong growth in assets in the eastern european fund  and omnibus account fees increased as the company has realized an increase in asset growth through broker dealer distribution platforms 
general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily as a result of a decrease in sub advisory fees paid for portfolio management of the bonnel growth fund and an overall realignment of overhead costs with reduced revenues
