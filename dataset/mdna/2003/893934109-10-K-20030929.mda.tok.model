item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates a summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is detailed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates 
we have identified the following estimates that  in our opinion  are subjective in nature  require the exercise of judgment  and involve complex analysis 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions we may take in the future 
changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events 
subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
at june   our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million 
our allowance for doubtful accounts represents the amount of trade receivables that we do not expect to collect 
the valuation of our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our analysis of specific individual customer balances that are past due and  from that analysis  we estimate the amount of the receivable balance that we do not expect to collect 
that estimate is based on various factors  including our experience in collecting past due amounts from the customer being evaluated  the customer s current financial condition  the current economic environment and the economic outlook for the future 
inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange 
at june   we held products for sale or exchange in the ordinary course of business with a cost basis of approximately million and a fair value of approximately million 
at june   our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange are carried at the lower of cost or market value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
for purposes of computing our operating results for debt covenant compliance  our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange are reflected at market value 
the market value of our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange is based on quoted prices  when available 
our refined petroleum products inventories are traded in large fungible bulk markets pasadena  tx  new york harbor  chicago  il  tulsa  ok refining area  and los angeles  ca  and in city specific wholesale markets 
quoted market prices eg  nymex  platt s bulk  and opis wholesale are readily available for these markets 
however  quoted prices are not available from brokers for all future periods and delivery locations in which we are committed to do business 
when quoted prices are not available  the market value of our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange is based on the nearest quoted market price  plus quoted basis differentials to the various bulk market areas  plus the transportation cost to deliver the product from the bulk trading market to the city specific markets 
near term basis differentials are quoted and traded in the over the counter petroleum markets and are verified by the various cash brokers that facilitate trading 
we estimate the basis differentials for certain deferred trading months and city specific locations because we cannot secure a forward traded basis differential quote from a broker 
in those situations  our mark to market model estimates the basis differentials based on a rolling historical average  which is updated quarterly 
we utilize this valuation methodology for all inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange  along with any valuation of a related exchange imbalance with a trading partner 
currently  it is not practicable for us to estimate the effects on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows from an unfavorable change in basis differentials 
prepaid transportation costs 
at june   we have prepaid certain transportation costs of approximately million to interstate pipelines 
we have a contractual right to apply the prepaid amounts against future transportation charges on volumes to be shipped in the future 
we monitor our actual volumes shipped to determine if the prepaid transportation costs ultimately will be recovered 
in order to make that assessment we must estimate our future shipping volumes 
if our estimate of our future shipping volumes were to decrease  we may not be able to utilize the prepaid transportation costs 
derivative contracts 
at june   we are a party to certain derivative contracts that require us to receive and deliver physical quantities of refined petroleum products over a specified term at a specified price 
our derivative contracts are carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
at june   our net unrealized losses on derivative contracts were approximately million 
the valuation of our derivative contracts is based on quoted prices  when available 
however  quoted prices are not available from brokers for all future periods and delivery locations in which we are committed to do business 
when quoted prices are not available  we estimate the values based on a combination of published market prices and estimates based on historical market conditions 
for market locations in which we have access to product via our terminals  dedicated pipeline capacity  a throughput agreement or an exchange arrangement  fair value is determined by adding the near month nymex futures quote to the appropriate basis differential and the transportation cost to deliver the product from the bulk trading location to the contract s specified delivery location 
we estimate the basis differentials for certain deferred trading months and city specific locations because we cannot secure a forward traded basis differential quote from a broker 
in those situations  our mark to market model estimates the basis differentials based on a rolling historical average  which is updated quarterly 
for our derivative contracts that settle against wholesale and retail pricing indices  we use a rolling historical average difference between the pricing index eg  department of energy national and opis wholesale indices and the related nymex futures contract utilized to manage the commodity price risk associated with the commitment 
for market locations in which we do not have access to product via our terminals  dedicated pipeline capacity  a throughput agreement or an exchange arrangement  we purchase product on a spot basis from approved vendors to satisfy our contractual obligations 
in these contracts  we are exposed to the differential between the bulk trading locations and the city specific markets  as we do not control the pipeline and terminal capacity to facilitate shipment of the physical product 
our mark to market model incorporates this basis differential to each city specific location 
currently  it is not practicable for us to estimate the effects on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows from an unfavorable change in basis differentials 
accrued lease abandonment 
at june   we have an accrued liability of approximately million as our estimate of the future payments we expect to pay  net of sublease payments we expect to receive from subleasing our vacated office space 
the valuation of our accrued lease abandonment liability is based on the timing and amount of sublease payments we expect to receive from subleasing our vacated office space 
our estimate of the timing and amount of sublease payments is based on information received from real estate brokers 
accrued transportation and deficiency agreements 
at june   we have an accrued liability of approximately million as our estimate of the future payments we expect to pay for the estimated shortfall in volumes for the remainder of the terms of our transportation and deficiency agreements 
the valuation of our accrual for transportation and deficiency agreements is based on our estimate of the future volumes we expect to supply and ship with the counterparties to these agreements 
we estimate the future volumes based on our historical volumes supplied and shipped with the counterparties 
our accrued liability would be adjusted if our current projections of future volumes to be supplied and shipped with the counterparties indicated a significant increase or decrease in expected volumes due to changes in the scope and breadth of our supply  distribution  and marketing operations 
accrued environmental obligations 
at june   we have an accrued liability of approximately million as our estimate of the undiscounted future payments we expect to pay for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions attributable to past operations 
the valuation of our accrued environmental obligations is based on our estimate of the remediation costs to be incurred in the future 
we estimate the future remediation costs based on specific site studies using enacted laws and regulations 
estimates of our environmental obligations are subject to change due to a number of factors and judgments involved in the estimation process  including the early stage of investigation at certain sites  the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation  technology changes affecting remediation methods  alternative remediation methods and strategies  and changes in environmental laws and regulations 
significant developments during the year ended june  on july   we closed on the purchase of a  barrel terminal in brownsville  texas 
the terminal provides us with additional storage and rail car handling facilities and operating synergies with our main facility in brownsville  texas 
on august   we announced the signing of a long term terminaling agreement with pmi trading limited to provide distribution related services and a related pipeline construction assistance agreement with pmi services north america  inc  both affiliates of petroleos mexicanos  for the construction of a new mile us products pipeline from the us mexican border to our terminaling facility located at the port of brownsville  texas 
during the three months ended september   we relocated our supply  distribution and marketing operations from atlanta  georgia to our then existing office space at th street in denver  colorado 
during october and november  our supply  distribution and marketing operations moved into our new office space at broadway in denver  colorado 
our executive and administrative operations vacated our office space at th street and joined our supply  distribution  and marketing operations at broadway during june on february   we announced the purchase of a  barrel terminal in fairfax  virginia that supplies products in the washington  dc market  including dulles airport 
the transaction closed on january  on february   we closed on the purchase of all of the shares of capital stock of coastal fuels marketing  inc and its subsidiary  coastal tug and barge  inc from a wholly owned subsidiary of el paso merchant energy petroleum company  or epme pc  along with the rights to and operations of the southeast marketing division of epme pc 
the acquisition includes five florida terminals  with aggregate capacity of approximately million barrels  and a related tug and barge operation  collectively the coastal fuels assets 
the coastal fuels assets primarily provide sales and storage of bunker fuel  no 
oil  diesel fuel and gasoline at cape canaveral  port manatee tampa  port everglades ft 
lauderdale and fisher island miami  and storage of asphalt at jacksonville  florida 
the purchase price for the acquisition was approximately million  including approximately million of product inventory 
the purchase price included contingent consideration of approximately million due and payable to epme pc upon the delivery by epme pc of audited financial statements of the coastal fuels assets 
on april   epme pc delivered to us the audited financial statements of the coastal fuels assets and epme pc was paid million on april  on february   we executed a credit agreement with ubs ag that initially provided for a million revolving line of credit  or the working capital credit facility  and a million senior secured term loan  or the term loan 
transmontaigne utilized funds available under the credit agreement to consummate the acquisition of the coastal fuels assets and repay our former back credit facility 
on may   we consummated the sale of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due old notes and received proceeds of million net of underwriters discounts of million 
we used the net proceeds from the offering of the old notes to repay the term loan 
the indenture governing the old notes contains covenants that  among other things  limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on  redeem or repurchase our common stock  make investments  make certain dispositions of assets  engage in transaction with affiliates  create certain liens  and consolidate  merge  or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
the old notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by our subsidiaries other than minor subsidiaries that are inactive and have no assets or operations 
we are a holding company for our subsidiaries  with no independent assets or operations 
accordingly  we are dependent upon the distribution of the earnings of our subsidiaries  whether in the form of dividends  advances or payments on account of inter company obligations  to service our debt obligations 
there are no restrictions on our ability or any subsidiary guarantor to obtain funds from our subsidiaries 
on june   we amended and restated the working capital credit facility in connection with the syndication of the facility 
all outstanding borrowings under the working capital credit facility are due and payable on february  the working capital credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on indebtedness  limitations on dividends and other distributions  limitations on certain inter company transactions  limitations on mergers  consolidation and the disposition of assets  limitations on investments and acquisitions and limitations on liens

in addition  we may not make aggregate expenditures in excess of million with respect to general corporate purposes including capital expenditures  cash paid for acquisitions  and redemption of the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock over the term of the agreement  however  such limit shall be increased by certain cash flow amounts generated after february  on june   we redeemed the remaining outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants for approximately million in cash 
subsequent events we sold the old notes in a private placement transaction that was exempt from registration under the federal securities act of on may   we entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to make an exchange offer of the new notes for old notes 
the registration rights agreement also requires us to use our best efforts to cause the registration statement filed with respect to the exchange offer to be declared effective by october  and consummate the exchange offer no later than december  if we do not do so  additional interest payments will be payable on the old notes 
on july   we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission to exchange our new notes for old notes 
results of operations business segments operating results for debt covenant compliance as a result of the implementation of eitf  our inventories minimum volumes and discretionary volumes are carried at the lower of cost first in  first out or market  while our risk management contracts are carried at market 
as a result  if market prices are increasing during the end of a quarter  we may report significant losses on risk management contracts and significant deferred gains on discretionary inventory volumes at the end of that quarter and report significant gains on our beginning inventories discretionary volumes in the following quarter 
because management continuously manages our operations and evaluates our performance from an overall portfolio basis that considers the changes in the fair value of our discretionary inventory volumes held for immediate sale or exchange  derivative sales and purchase contracts and risk management contracts  management uses operating results for debt covenant compliance to monitor the financial performance of our business segments 
for purposes of computing our operating results for debt covenant compliance  our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange are reflected at market value 
operating results for debt covenant compliance also is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants included in our borrowing arrangements 
our chief operating decision maker assesses the financial performance for each of our reportable segments using operating results for debt covenant compliance 
under sfas no 
 we are required to report measures of profit and loss that are used by our chief operating decision maker in assessing financial performance for each of our reportable segments and  accordingly  we report operating results for debt covenant compliance in connection with our operating segment disclosures 
in determining our operating results for debt covenant compliance  inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange are reflected at fair value  which matches the treatment of our derivative and risk management contracts 
the effects of changes in the fair value of our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange are included in net operating margins attributable to our supply  distribution and marketing segment in the period in which the fair value actually changes 
operating results for debt covenant compliance also eliminates the impairment of our inventories minimum volumes and base operating volumes on our net operating margins attributable to our supply  distribution and marketing segment

the increase of approximately million in net operating margins attributable to our terminals  pipelines  and tugs and barges segment for as compared to was due principally to the contribution of approximately million from the coastal fuels assets  which we acquired on february  and the improved operating results from our historical facilities 
the net operating margins from our historical facilities increased from million in to million in principally due to capacity expansion at our brownsville facilities  the acquisition of the remaining interest in the razorback pipeline and additional product throughput throughout the remainder of our terminal system 
the net operating margins attributable to our supply  distribution and marketing segment declined from million in to million in during the three months ended september   a disruption at a chicago refinery resulted in significant volatility in basis differentials  which created significant margin opportunities 
that type of opportunity did not reoccur during  which resulted in basis margins bulk sales margins  net of unwinding risk management contracts during inventory liquidation declining from million in to million in the net operating margins from our light oil marketing  net of the cost or benefit of rolling risk management contracts used to manage commodity price volatility to future months  declined slightly from million in to million in the net operating margins from our supply management services also declined slightly from million in to million in results of operations historical financial statements selected annual results of operations data are summarized below in thousands years ended june  net operating margins supply  distribution and marketing    terminals and pipelines    total net operating margins    selling  general and administrative expenses   depreciation and amortization    corporate relocation and transition   operating income    dividend income from petroleum related investments  interest income  interest expense and other financing costs  net   gain loss on disposition of assets  net  earnings before income taxes    income tax expense    earnings before cumulative effect adjustment   cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net earnings    preferred stock dividends  net    net earnings loss attributable to common stockholders  net operating margins represent net revenues  less direct operating costs and expenses

we believe that  in addition to cash flow from operating activities and net earnings loss  ebitda is a useful financial performance measurement for assessing operating performance since it provides an additional basis to evaluate our ability to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures 
to evaluate ebitda  the components of ebitda such as net operating margin and direct operating expenses and the variability of such components over time  also should be considered 
ebitda should not be construed  however  as an alternative to operating income loss as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap as an indicator of our operating performance  or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
we believe that operating results for debt covenant compliance is a useful measure in evaluating our performance because it eliminates the impact on our operating results from gains recognized and deferred on discretionary inventory volumes and the impairment of our inventories base operating volumes and minimum volumes 
we believe that  in addition to operating income  cash flow from operating activities and ebitda  operating results for debt covenant compliance is a useful financial performance measurement reflecting our ability to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures 
operating results for debt covenant compliance is used as a measure of our financial performance in our borrowing arrangements 
in evaluating operating results for debt covenant compliance  we believe that consideration should be given  among other things  to the amount by which operating results for debt covenant compliance exceeds interest costs for the period  how operating results for debt covenant compliance compares to principal repayments on debt for the period  and how operating results for debt covenant compliance compares to capital expenditures for the period 
as a result of the implementation of eitf  our inventories minimum volumes and discretionary volumes are carried at the lower of cost first in  first out or market  while our risk management contracts are carried at market 
as a result  if market prices are increasing during the end of the quarter  we may report significant losses on risk management contracts and significant deferred gains on discretionary inventory volumes at the end of that quarter and report significant gains on our beginning inventories discretionary volumes in the following quarter

we recognized approximately million in net operating margins associated with this contract extension and we deferred approximately million for the value of the supply logistical management services that we are committed to provide over the term of the supply contract 
the net operating margins from our supply  distribution and marketing operations are as follows in thousands years ended june  rack sales    bulk sales    contract sales    supply management services    gross sales    cost of product sold    net margin before other direct costs and expenses  other direct costs and expenses net gains losses on risk management activities   change in unrealized gains losses on derivative contracts  lower of cost or market write downs on base operating inventory volumes lower of cost or market write downs on minimum inventory volumes net operating margins    our supply  distribution and marketing operations typically purchase products at prevailing prices from refiners and producers at production points and common trading locations 
once we purchase these products  we schedule them for delivery to our terminals  as well as terminals owned by third parties with which we have storage or throughput agreements 
from these terminal locations  we then sell our products to customers primarily through three types of arrangements rack sales  bulk sales and contract sales 
rack sales 
rack sales are spot sales to commercial and industrial end users  independent retailers  cruise ship operators and jobbers that do not involve continuing contractual obligations to purchase or deliver product 
rack sales are priced and delivered on a daily basis through truck loading racks or marine fueling equipment 
our selling price of a particular product on a particular day at a particular terminal is a function of our supply at that terminal  our estimate of the costs to replenish the product at that terminal  our desire to reduce inventory levels at that terminal that day  and other factors 
rack sales are recognized as revenue when the product is delivered to the customer through the truck loading rack or marine fueling equipment 
rack sales were approximately  million   million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
for the years ended june   and  we averaged approximately  barrels   barrels and  barrels per day  respectively  of delivered volumes under rack sales 
bulk sales 
bulk sales are sales of large quantities of product to wholesalers  distributors and marketers in major cash markets 
we also may make a bulk sale of products while the product is being transported in the common carrier pipelines or by barge or vessel 
bulk sales are recognized as revenue when the title to the product is transferred to the customer  which generally occurs upon confirmation of the terms of the sale 
bulk sales were approximately  million   million and  million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
for the years ended june   and  we averaged approximately  barrels   barrels and  barrels per day  respectively  of delivered volumes under bulk sales 
contract sales 
contract sales are sales to commercial and industrial end users  independent retailers  cruise ship operators and jobbers that are made pursuant to negotiated contracts  generally ranging from one to six months in duration 
contract sales provide these customers with a specified volume of product during the agreement term 
at the customer s option  the pricing of the product delivered under a contract sale may be fixed at a stipulated price per gallon  or it may vary based on changes in published indices 
contract sales are recognized as revenue when the product is delivered to the customer through the truck loading rack or marine fueling equipment 
contract sales were approximately  million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
for the years ended june   and  we averaged approximately  barrels   barrels and  barrels per day  respectively  of delivered volumes under contract sales 
supply management services contracts 
we provide supply management services to companies and governmental entities that desire to outsource their fuel supply function and to reduce the price volatility associated with their fuel supplies 
we offer three types of supply management services delivered fuel price management  retail price management  and logistical supply management services 
sales pursuant to supply management services contracts were approximately million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
for the years ended june   and  we averaged approximately  barrels   barrels and  barrels per day  respectively  of delivered volumes under supply management services contracts 
cost of product sold 
the cost of product sold includes the cost of the product inventory sold on a first in  first out basis  pipeline transportation and other freight costs  terminal throughput  additive and storage costs  and commissions 
cost of product sold is approximately  million   million and  million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
cost of product sold is as follows in thousands years ended june  inventory product costs    transportation and related charges    throughput  storage and related charges    other    cost of product sold    net gains losses on risk management activities 
our risk management strategy generally is intended to maintain a balanced position of forward sale and purchase commitments against our discretionary inventories held for immediate sale or exchange and future contractual delivery obligations  thereby reducing exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
we evaluate our exposure to commodity price risk from an overall portfolio basis that considers the continuous movement of discretionary inventory volumes held for immediate sale or exchange and our obligations to deliver products at fixed prices through our sales contracts and supply management contracts 
our physical inventory position  which includes firm commitments to buy and sell product  is offset with risk management contracts  principally futures contracts on the nymex 
when we purchase refined petroleum products  we enter into futures contracts to sell a corresponding amount of product to protect against price fluctuations for the underlying commodity 
when we ultimately sell the underlying inventory to a customer  we unwind the related risk management contract 
in order to effectively manage commodity price risk  we must predict when we will sell the underlying product 
if we fail to accurately predict the timing of those future sales  and the product remains in our inventory longer than the expiration date of the futures contract  we must settle the old futures contract and enter into a new futures contract to sell the product to manage the commodity price risk against the same inventory 
we refer to this as rolling the risk management contracts 
during a period of rising prices  our risk management contracts ie  short futures contracts that are entered into to reduce our risk to commodity price changes associated with our discretionary inventory volumes held for immediate sale or exchange will decline in value resulting in a loss 
net gains losses on risk management activities were approximately million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively  due principally to rising declining commodity prices during these periods 
lower of cost or market write downs on base operating volumes 
during the year ended june   we recognized impairment losses of approximately million due to lower of cost or market write downs on the base operating volumes due principally to declining prices at the end of a quarterly reporting period 
during the years ended june  and  we did not report any of our inventory volumes as base operating volumes 
during these years our base operating volumes were a component of our minimum inventory volumes 
lower of cost or market write downs on inventories minimum volumes 
during the years ended june   and  we recognized impairment losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  due to lower of cost or market write downs on the minimum inventory volumes 
costs and expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million  compared to million for the year ended june   and for the year ended june  selling  general and administrative expenses are as follows in thousands years ended june  wages and employee benefits    office costs  utilities and communication charges   accounting and legal expenses    property and casualty insurance    other    selling  general and administrative expenses   depreciation and amortization for the years ended june   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase of million in depreciation and amortization for as compared to is principally related to depreciation and amortization on new additions to property  plant  and equipment 
the decrease of million in depreciation and amortization in as compared to was due primarily to the disposition of the little rock facilities and norco system 
we recognized special charges of million and million during the years ended june  and  respectively  related to our corporate relocation and transition 
as of june  we have completed the relocation of our employees from atlanta  georgia to denver  colorado and paid the remaining special termination benefits and transition bonuses 
other income and expenses dividend income from petroleum related investments for the year ended june  was million  compared to million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  the decrease of million in dividend income for as compared to was due principally to a decrease of million in dividends received from lion oil company and the absence of million in dividends received from west shore 
we sold a portion of our investment in west shore on july  and our remaining investment on october  the decrease of million in dividend income in as compared to was due principally to the decline in dividends received from west shore 
interest income for the year ended june  was million  as compared to million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  pursuant to our cash management practices  excess cash balances are used to pay down our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and commodity margin loan 
interest expense for the year ended june  was million  compared to million during the year ended june   and million during the year ended june  interest expense is as follows in thousands years ended june  working capital credit facility  former bank credit facility    letters of credit commodity margin loan interest rate swap   term loan  senior subordinated notes  senior notes   other interest expense    other financing costs for the year ended june  were million  compared to million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  the decrease of million in other financing costs for as compared to was due principally to an unrealized gain on the settlement of our interest rate swap of million during  as compared to an unrealized loss on an interest rate swap of million during  and a decrease in the early payment penalty of million  offset by an increase in the write off of debt issuance costs of million related to the repayment of our former bank credit facility and the term loan 
on february   we settled our obligations under the swap agreement when we repaid our former bank revolving credit facility 
on may   we repaid the term loan with the proceeds from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes 
gain loss on the disposition of assets for the year ended june  consists of million loss on the sale of west shore  million gain on the sale of the norco system  million gain on the sale of our investment in st oil company  and million loss on the sale of other assets 
gain on the disposition of assets was million for the year ended june  due to the sale of the little rock facilities 
income taxes income tax expense was million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  the effective combined federal and state income tax rate was  and for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the effective combined rate for includes a provision of approximately million for a change in cumulative temporary differences 
cumulative effect adjustment for a change in accounting principle as a result of the consensus reached on eitf  we are no longer permitted to carry our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange at fair value effective october  the excess of the fair value of our inventories discretionary volumes held for immediate sale or exchange over their cost basis as of october  has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect adjustment for a change in accounting principle 
preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends on our series a convertible preferred stock were million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the decrease in the current year dividend resulted from a reduction in the number of shares of series a convertible preferred stock outstanding during the current period 
on june   we entered into an agreement with the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock  or the preferred stock recapitalization agreement  to redeem a portion of the outstanding series a convertible preferred stock and warrants in exchange for cash  shares of common stock  and shares of a newly created and designated preferred stock  or the series b redeemable convertible preferred stock 
the preferred stock recapitalization agreement resulted in the redemption of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in exchange for the i issuance of  shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock with a fair value of approximately million  ii issuance of  shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately million  and iii a cash payment of approximately million 
on june   we redeemed the remaining  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants that were outstanding for a cash payment of approximately million 
preferred stock dividends on our series b redeemable convertible preferred stock were million  nil and nil for the years ended june   and there were no shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding during the years ended june  and the initial carrying amount of the series b redeemable convertible preferred stock of approximately million will be decreased ratably over its year term until it equals its liquidation value of approximately million with an equal reduction in the amount of preferred stock dividends recorded for financial reporting purposes 
the amount of the dividend recognized for financial reporting purposes is composed of the amount of the dividend payable to the holders of the series b redeemable convertible preferred stock of million  offset by the amortization of the premium on the carrying amount of the series b redeemable convertible preferred stock of million 
liquidity  capital resources  and commodity price risk at june   our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by million  compared to million at june  the decrease of million in working capital is due principally to the classification of the outstanding borrowings on the working capital credit facility as current liabilities at june  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at june   we have classified the outstanding borrowings under the working capital credit facility as a current liability because we have pledged our current assets as security for the facility and it currently is our expectation that we will repay the outstanding borrowings within one year of the balance sheet date 
the increase in accounts receivable of million is due principally to increased supply  distribution  and marketing volumes coupled with an increase in commodity prices 
our gross revenues for the supply  distribution and marketing operations were approximately million and million for the one month ended june  and  respectively 
our average days sales in accounts receivable was approximately days and days for the years ended june  and  respectively 
our inventories discretionary volumes are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as current assets and are carried at the lower of cost or market at june   and at fair value at june  inventories discretionary volumes are as follows in thousands june  june  amount bbls amount bbls volumes held for immediate sale or exchange    volumes held for base operations   inventories discretionary volumes     prior to march   we treated inventories not held for sale or exchange in the ordinary course of business and not subject to price risk management as inventories minimum volumes 
our minimum inventories consisted of tank bottoms  line fill in our proprietary pipelines  and in transit volumes on common carrier pipelines 
our revised risk management policy now allows us the discretion to manage the commodity price risk relating to up to  barrels of our base operating inventory volumes 
the ability to manage the commodity price risk relating to a portion of our base operating inventory volumes necessitated the transfer for financial reporting purposes of approximately million barrels of our original inventories minimum volumes to inventories base operating volumes  representing the in transit volumes on common carriers  within inventories discretionary volumes 
based on the level of our operations at march   we determined that we should increase our base operating inventory  exclusive of minimum volumes  to approximately million barrels 
changes in our operation  such as the acquisition of additional terminals  may result in changes in the volume of our base operating inventory 
the activity in our volumes held for base operations  exclusive of minimum volumes  is summarized as follows in thousands amount barrels as of june  transfer from minimum volumes   expansion of existing operations  acquisition of coastal fuels assets  decrease in fifo cost basis  lower of cost or market write down  as of june    our inventories minimum volumes  which are limited to tank bottoms and line fill in proprietary pipelines at june   are not held for sale or exchange in the ordinary course of business and  therefore  we do not manage the commodity price risks associated with this inventory 
our inventories minimum volumes are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as non current assets and are carried at the lower of cost or market 
inventories minimum volumes are as follows in thousands june  june  amount bbls amount bbls gasolines    distillates   no

the activity in our inventories minimum volumes is summarized as follows in thousands amount barrels as of june    transfer to discretionary volumes   acquisition of coastal fuels assets  lower of cost or market write down as of june   the following table indicates the maturities of our derivative contracts  including the credit quality of our counterparties to those contracts with unrealized gains at june  fair value of contracts in thousands maturity less than year maturity years maturity in excess of years total unrealized gain position asset investment grade   non investment grade    no external rating   unrealized loss position liability   net unrealized loss position liability    at june   the unrealized gain on our derivative contracts with non investment grade counterparties was approximately million 
a single customer represented approximately million of that unrealized gain 
at june   we also had derivative contracts with that customer that were in an unrealized loss position of approximately million 
therefore  the net unrealized loss on all our derivative contracts with that customer was approximately million at june  the following table includes information about the changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts with that customer for the year ended june  in thousands fair value at june   amounts realized or otherwise settled during the year  change in fair value attributable to change in commodity prices  other changes in fair value  fair value at june   excluding the acquisitions of coastal fuels assets and the products terminals in brownsville  texas and fairfax  virginia  capital expenditures for the year ended june  were million for terminal and pipeline facilities and assets to support these facilities 
excluding acquisitions  capital expenditures for the year ending june   are estimated to be approximately million  which includes approximately million of capital expenditures to maintain our existing facilities 
future capital expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the availability  economics and cost of appropriate acquisitions which we identify and evaluate  the economics  cost and required regulatory approvals with respect to the expansion and enhancement of existing systems and facilities  customer demand for the services we provide  local  state and federal governmental regulations  environmental compliance requirements  and the availability of debt financing and equity capital on acceptable terms 
on june   we amended and restated the working capital credit facility in connection with the syndication of the facility 
our working capital credit facility as in effect at june  provides for a maximum borrowing line of credit that was the lesser of i million and ii the borrowing base as defined  million at june  
the maximum borrowing amount is reduced by the amount of letters of credit that are outstanding 
the borrowing base is a function of our cash  accounts receivable  inventory  exchanges  margin deposits  open positions of energy services and risk management contracts  outstanding letters of credit  and outstanding indebtedness as defined in the facility 
at june   we had borrowings of million outstanding and letters of credit of million outstanding under the working capital credit facility 
we also had the ability to borrow an additional million under the facility based on the borrowing base computation at june  all outstanding borrowings under the working capital credit facility are due and payable on february  on may   we consummated the sale and issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due old notes and received proceeds of million net of underwriters discounts of million 
we used the net proceeds from the offering of the old notes to repay the term loan 
the old notes mature on june  and interest is payable semi annually in arrears on each june and december commencing on december  the old notes are unsecured and subordinated to all of our existing and future senior debt 
upon certain change of control events  each holder of the old notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of its notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued interest 
we have contractual obligations that are required to be settled in cash 
the amounts of our contractual obligations are as follows in thousands years ending june  thereafter debt    preferred stock  transportation and deficiency agreements operating leases existing office space      vacated office space excluding estimated sublease rentals  terminal and pipeline capacity   property and equipment total contractual obligations to be settled in cash   see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have outstanding letters of credit with third parties in the amount of million  which expire within one year 
we believe that our current working capital position  future cash expected to be provided by operating activities  available borrowing capacity under our working capital credit facility and commodity margin loan  and our relationship with institutional lenders and equity investors should enable us to meet our planned capital and liquidity requirements through at least the maturity date of our working capital credit facility february

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk policies we are exposed to market risk through changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
we have no foreign currency exchange risks 
risk management policies have been established by our risk management committee  rmc  to monitor and control these market risks 
our rmc is composed primarily of our senior executives 
our rmc has responsibility for oversight with respect to our risk management policies and our audit committee of the board of directors approves the financial exposure limits 
commodity risk our earnings  cash flow and liquidity may be affected by a variety of factors beyond our control  including the supply of  and demand for refined petroleum products 
demand for refined petroleum products depends on  among other factors  changes in domestic and foreign economies  weather conditions  domestic and foreign political affairs  production levels  the availability of imports  the marketing of competitive fuels and the extent of government regulation 
as a result  refined petroleum products experience price volatility  which directly impacts our revenues and net operating margins 
our net operating margins are not impacted as much by the absolute price of the commodities as they are by the impact that the absolute price has upon supply and demand of refined petroleum products and the related local market supply and demand imbalances 
relative month end commodity prices from june  to june  nymex close on the last day of the month are as follows crude oil heating oil gasoline we have developed risk management strategies to manage the commodity price risk associated with our discretionary inventories held for immediate sale or exchange and derivative contracts 
our risk management strategy generally is intended to maintain a balanced position of forward sale and purchase commitments  discretionary inventories held for immediate sale or exchange  and risk management contracts  thereby reducing exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
we evaluate our exposure to commodity price risk from an overall portfolio basis that considers the continuous movement of discretionary inventory volumes held for immediate sale or exchange and our obligations to deliver and receive products at fixed prices through our derivative sales and purchase contracts 
our physical inventory position  which includes firm commitments to buy and sell product  is reconciled daily and that net position is offset with risk management contracts 
during the three months ended march   we re evaluated our risk management strategy in light of the acquisition of the coastal fuels assets  which expanded our product offering to include bunker fuel and no 
oil  the expansion of our supply  marketing and distribution activities along the mississippi and ohio rivers  and the significance of the overall losses we were incurring on our nymex futures contracts 
upon completion of our analysis  we concluded that our base inventory volumes and minimum inventory volumes  which are necessary to support our operations  would be increased in the aggregate from approximately million barrels to approximately million barrels  and that our risk management policy should permit discretion in determining the volume of inventories that would be managed with nymex futures contracts at any particular point in time 
consequently  our risk management policy has been amended to allow our management team the discretion to manage the commodity price risk relating to up to  barrels of our base operating inventory volumes  which would reduce the total unmanaged inventory base operating volumes and minimum volumes to approximately million barrels  or to leave unmanaged up to  barrels of our discretionary inventory held for immediate sale or exchange  which would increase our total unmanaged inventory to approximately million barrels 
we decide whether to manage the commodity price risk relating to a portion of our base operating inventory or to leave a portion of our discretionary inventory unmanaged depending on our expectations of future market changes 
to the extent that we do not manage the commodity price risk relating to a portion of our inventory and commodity prices move adversely  we could suffer losses on that inventory 
if  however  prices move favorably  we would realize a gain on the sale of the inventory that we would not realize if substantially all of our inventory was managed 
at june   we were subject to commodity price risk on approximately  barrels of discretionary inventories held for immediate sale or exchange because those barrels were not offset with risk management contracts or future contractual delivery obligations 
our rmc reviews our discretionary inventory volumes held for immediate sale or exchange  open positions in fixed price forward sale and purchase commitments  and risk management contracts on a regular basis in order to ensure compliance with our inventory and risk management policies 
when we purchase refined petroleum products  we generally enter into nymex futures contracts to protect against price fluctuations for the underlying commodity 
futures contracts are obligations to purchase or sell a specific volume of inventory at a fixed price at a future date 
the nymex requires an initial margin deposit to open a futures contract 
at june  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  on deposit to cover our initial margin requirements on open nymex futures contracts 
nymex futures contracts also require daily settlements for changes in commodity prices 
unfavorable commodity price changes subject us to variation margin calls that require us to make cash payments to the nymex in amounts that may be material 
at june   a per gallon unfavorable change in commodity prices would have required us to make a cash payment of approximately million to cover the variation margin 
conversely  a per gallon favorable change in commodity prices would have permitted us to receive approximately million 
we use our credit lines to fund these margin calls  but such funding requirements could exceed our ability to access capital 
we have the contractual right to request that the counterparties to our supply management services contracts post additional letters of credit or make additional cash deposits with us to assist us in meeting our obligations to cover our margin requirements 
for the years ended june   and  we recognized net gains losses on risk management activities of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
when we ultimately sell the underlying inventory to a customer  we unwind the related futures contract 
if there is correlation in price changes between the forward price curve in the futures market and the value of physical products in the cash market  the net changes in our variation margin position should be offset by the net operating margins we receive when we sell the underlying discretionary inventory 
therefore  in order to effectively manage commodity price risk  we must predict when we will sell the underlying product 
if we fail to accurately predict the timing of those future sales  and the product remains in our inventory longer than the expiration date of the futures contract  we must settle the old futures contract and enter into a new futures contract to sell the product to manage the commodity price risk against the same inventory 
we refer to this as rolling the risk management contracts 
included in the net gains losses on risk management activities for the years ended june  and  are gains losses of approximately million and million  respectively  from unwinding the original futures contract in an unfavorable favorable futures market and rolling the risk management contracts in an unfavorable favorable futures market 
it is not practicable to obtain the information for the year ended june  at june   a per gallon unfavorable change in commodity prices relative to our open positions in derivative sales and purchase contracts and risk management contracts would have resulted in the recognition of a loss realized and unrealized of approximately million 
however  the fair value of our discretionary inventory held for immediate sale or exchange would have increased by approximately million 
the gain from the increase in the fair value of our discretionary inventory volumes held for immediate sale or exchange may not be recognized for financial reporting purposes until those volumes have been sold to customers  which may be in an accounting period subsequent to the accounting period in which the losses on derivative contracts and risk management contracts are recognized 
fixed price forward sale and purchase commitments are subject to risks relating to market value fluctuations  as well as counterparty credit and liquidity risk 
we have established procedures to continually monitor these contracts in order to minimize credit risk  including the establishment and review of credit limits  margin requirements  master net out arrangements  letters of credit and other guarantees 
interest rate risk at june   we had outstanding borrowings of million under our working capital credit facility 
we are exposed to interest rate risk because the working capital credit facility is a variable rate based credit facility 
the interest rate is based on the lender s alternate base rate plus a spread  or libor plus a spread  in effect at the time of the borrowings and is adjusted monthly  bi monthly  quarterly or semi annually 
based on the outstanding balance of our variable interest rate debt at june   and assuming market interest rates increase or decrease by basis points  the potential annual increase or decrease in interest expense is approximately million
