overview we are a leading on line database marketing company that uses our on line media network to generate leads  customers and sales for us and our corporate clients 
we provide complete end to end marketing solutions for companies seeking to increase sales and customers through on line marketing programs  database development and enhancement programs 
the services we offer range from the development of a complete creative promotion to be used to market the client s product to consumers  broadcasting a promotion on line in order to generate new customers for the client  delivery of data files from the results of campaigns  creating and hosting the customized websites or web pages necessary to effect the consumer transaction that drives the client s sales and generating comprehensive reporting in order for the client to analyze the effectiveness of a promotion 
we use our websites  interactive games  email marketing and database of permission based  profiled records and the on line media of third parties to generate the customers  sales and leads for our clients 
we are paid by our clients primarily on a success based model  in that we receive a fee for every lead  customer or sale generated for the client 
in addition to our third party client based revenue  we generate revenue from our own products and services  such as retail gift items  which accounted for approximately of our revenue in the fiscal year ended november  fiscal 
commencing in fiscal  these products and services have been expanded  and will include an isp service  a long distance telecom service  and on line dating 
we also generate revenues from the sales and rentals for use both on line and off line of our proprietary  profiled databases 
background from our inception in under the name quintel communications  inc through  we generated the bulk of our revenue from database marketing using the traditional media of television  postal mail and telemarketing 
in  we repositioned our database marketing business to the on line media of the web 
applying the direct marketing disciplines honed from our years of operating in the off line media  we believe we are able to provide enhanced response based results in a more cost efficient and scaleable manner via on line marketing 
in addition  as a result of our direct marketing background  we believe we are able to design on line marketing programs to cost effectively generate traffic and leads for traditional direct marketing media channels  such as inbound and outbound telemarketing and direct mail 
on line marketing we own and operate multiple on line properties  such as grouplotto 
com  the free on line lottery  and atlascreditgroup 
com  atlaseducationgroup 
com and imatchup 
com which commenced operations in december  as well as a number of interactive games such as direct deposit promotions and scratch win  all supplemented by other web sites and services provided on the web 
these activities are designed to generate real time response based marketing results for our corporate clients  as well as for our own offers 
when visiting our on line properties  consumers are given the opportunity to purchase  sign up for  ask to be contacted regarding  or simply indicate an interest in  hundreds of offers for various products and services provided by our corporate clients and marketing partners 
specifically  through these interactive web properties we generate a variety of transactional results for our corporate clients ranging from a web traffic  b inbound telemarketing calls  c outbound telemarketing leads  d demographically psychographically profiled lists of consumers  e highly targeted customized response based leads  f completed applications for products  and g actual sales of products and services 
websites 
the grouplotto website offers consumers the opportunity to win up to million daily in a free  on line lottery 
the lottery prizes are indemnified by an independent  third party agency 
in order to play  each consumer must provide complete and accurate registration information and agree to receive opt in marketing messages from grouplotto and our marketing partners 
the interactive media on this website includes registration pages  game banners  and pop ups  the purpose of which is to generate web traffic  leads and sales 
revenue is generated at this website from our corporate clients who pay for such traffic  leads and sales 
we generate the bulk of our consumer traffic to this website through proprietary and third party email marketing programs  emailed to lists of consumers who have indicated an interest in our product and service offers by opting in to receive information on such offers 
similar to the grouplotto website  we generate results for our clients through several other interactive games and products 
for example  we market through a scratch and win game that offers consumers the chance to win any number of prizes  which range from to  the consumer plays the game by scratching with the mouse certain parts of the entry ticket to uncover the results 
these games are presented as pop ups upon browser exit  and can also be pushed to consumers by delivering them to the player s email inbox 
we also market credit card offers through our direct deposit sweepstakes game patent pending  whereby a consumer can win up to  instantly if a portion of his or her credit card number matches a pre selected winning number 
we own and operate several other websites such as atlascreditgroup 
com  atlaseducationgroup 
com  prizecade 
com and jewelclaimcenter 
com 
such websites are deployed to generate revenue for our clients in a similar manner as the grouplotto model described above 
each of these sites is designed to appeal to a specific consumer interest category that we matched with product promotions that appeal to such interest category 
email marketing 
direct marketing via email is an important business resource 
each program that we market for our clients can be implemented not only through the websites  interactive games and pop ups discussed above  but also  and often  through email marketing 
we currently market to approximately million permission based records  which are either owned by us or are managed by us under our revenue share arrangement 
compared to postal marketing and telemarketing  email marketing is significantly less expensive  offers much faster response times  and  we believe  provides for a more rich consumer media experience 
we now own an email delivery system acquired in december through the acquisition of the assets of infiknowledge 
com  a privately held canadian technology company  which reduces our dependence on third party vendors and further reduces the expenses associated with delivering our monthly commercial email messages and reduces the costs of our site maintenance and development costs 
for a further discussion of recent business and legal developments regarding this e commerce component  and specifically the loss of a significant customer and events impacting email marketing  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
one of the attractive features for clients  and  we believe  a significant competitive advantage  is our ability to create and test a variety of marketing campaigns for prospective and existing corporate clients at no risk to the client 
since we own  and have access to  extensive databases  manage our own internal creative department  and can deliver email at a low cost  we are able to offer prospective and existing clients the opportunity to test market new products  services  price points and creative concepts in order to determine if an on line campaign works for the client  and which campaigns work most effectively 
even after campaigns are fully implemented  we further analyze the marketing results to gauge whether the campaigns are continuing to generate adequate results for the client  whether the media is being utilized cost efficiently  and to determine whether new and different copy is yielding better overall results 
these are the traditional direct marketing disciplines  which we believe when coupled with our proprietary databases  the other databases under our management and our delivery and reporting systems  distinguish us from our competitors in the on line marketing industry 
syndication 
we expend a significant portion of our email resources to generate sales for our own products and services and for traffic to our websites 
after we develop a campaign that works efficiently on our own media  we often syndicate the program to third party media 
typically  we have expended time  media and other costs in developing certain campaigns 
in exchange for this invested effort  we obtain the right to market those campaigns to a list of other on line media companies 
we enter into agreements with these other on line media companies to run the campaigns  generally on a fee share arrangement 
we believe such media companies benefit from receiving an immediately marketable  fully packaged and tested marketing program 
as a result  we believe we are able to leverage campaigns we have developed including our own products and services so that we can generate additional revenue with virtually no costs or risks associated with such business extension 
traffix s products and services a new business unit  which we introduced during the three months ended february   is the on line marketing of our own products and services 
for example  one of our websites  thanksmuch 
com  sells gift items such as dvds  cd s and inexpensive jewelry directly to consumers 
when a consumer selects a gift item and tenders his credit card  he is given the opportunity to purchase other  more valuable products and services at special discounts 
in addition to the thanksmuch line of jewelry and gifts  we are developing and testing other products and services for direct marketing to consumers 
these products include credit card billed products in the voice over internet protocol area txnet ld  dial up modem isp back up systems txnet isp  dating personal programs conducted over the internet imatchup 
com  jewelry  voicemail  dvd s and books 
one of the additional benefits of these programs is our ability to accumulate consumer credit card data  which allows for the subsequent use of our marketing concept of just one click credit card billing  making on line purchases easier for the consumer  and allowing us to more easily process additional sales and services in the future 
in addition  certain of these services are designed as monthly recurring revenue sources  such as our dating and long distance service 
further  we anticipate that certain of these services will derive monthly recurring revenue streams through the use of local exchange carrier lec billing 
no assurances can be given  however  that these anticipated sources of revenue will generate any significant income to our operations in future fiscal periods  if at all 
during the year ended november   the thanksmuch 
com website generated approximately million  or approximately of consolidated net revenue  with an approximate  contribution to consolidated income from operations for such period 
our expansion in  and dependence on  our on line direct marketing efforts  coupled with the potential for state and or federal legislation limiting on line marketing s consumer contact capability  should all be considered when referring to our current fiscal year s results  as well as prior year s historical results  in evaluating the potential for our future operations  cash flows  and financial position

segment information during the fiscal year ended november  fiscal  we generated revenue from the following segments e commerce and off line marketing 
the e commerce segment realized significant growth during the fiscal year ended november   when compared to the prior fiscal periods  and currently represents the core of our business operations 
revenue in the e commerce segment is generated primarily from marketing of third party products and services on our websites and through email promotions 
the off line marketing services segment consists of revenue generated by us through off line direct marketing channels 
historically  this segment s activities consisted of telemarketing services used for the acquisition of long distance and wireless phone customers for various phone service providers 
in fiscal  this segment consisted exclusively of our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management  llc  and the revenues and expenses of montvale s net branch services provided to qualified mortgage banking and lending institutions 
the lec billed products segment represented telecommunications related products and services marketed by us directly to consumers who were billed by local exchange carriers lecs on the consumer s telephone bill 
this segment was inactive during fiscal  but is expected to become active again in the first quarter of fiscal  resulting from the marketing of our products and services that will be billed to consumers on their phone bill through the lecs 
segment information is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements referred to in the financial statements and supplementary data section hereof and incorporated herein by reference

our actual results could differ materially from the forward looking statements discussed herein 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in the report 
year ended november  compared to year ended november  our net revenues  on a segmental basis  and with the components of the individual segments  for each of the fiscal years ended november  and  are set forth in the following tables segment data net revenues  by segment component change change inc dec inc dec year ended november  e commerce components grouplotto and other websites    net branch commission fees    email marketing programs    data sales and rentals    sales of jewelry and gifts   internet game development and other    total e commerce    off line marketing service components net branch commission fees    other off line marketing    total off line marketing services    lec billed products and services components entertainment service royalties   enhanced services  principally voice mail 
  other lec billed services   total lec billed products and services   total consolidated net revenue    consolidated net revenue increased  or  to  for the year ended november  from  in the year ended november  the primary component of the increase was attributable to an approximate million increase in our e commerce segment net revenues  combined with an increase of approximately million in net revenue from our off line marketing services segment 
such increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in our lec billed product and services legacy segment 
the e commerce segment revenue increase resulted from our increasing focus on generating revenue from our current core business  on line direct marketing 
we expect this segment to continue to represent the substantial part of our revenue in future fiscal periods 
nevertheless  we continue to assess the potential of revenue generation from off line  conventional direct marketing activities and will implement that strategy if deemed beneficial for our company 
currently  we are using our on line databases to enhance third party off line databases through the application of overlay technology  whereby databases are appended to one another  effectively increasing the depth of consumer related information within the appended database 
the growth in our e commerce segment was primarily attributable to approximately million in revenue generated from the segment s email marketing program sub set 
this represented a million increase over the prior year s million in revenue generated from such segment s sub set 
we believe this substantial increase of approximately over the prior year was primarily the result of our acquisition of significant volumes of permission based email records  extension of the quantity and quality of third party client offers being emailed to the databases and greater efficiencies in our email delivery programs 
in the prior year s comparable period  specifically the first three months of the fiscal year ended november   we had been in the early stages of developing and carrying out our online strategy 
the revenue from the email marketing program sub set represented approximately of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended november   as compared to of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended november  during the year ended november   specifically within the period march  to november   we experienced problems with the delivery of our email promotional offers 
these problems caused reduced revenue and income from the e commerce sub segment 
we believe that the significant component of the email delivery problem is attributable to internet service providers that unilaterally block commercial emails from reaching their consumer subscribers 
we have addressed the issue by deploying new reinforced delivery platforms with increased redundancy and expanded diversification using both internal and external emailing resources 
although we have conceived of a number of programs to address this specific problem  there can be no assurance that any of these programs will work effectively  or can be timely implemented 
various state laws exist  and federal legislation is currently pending  that limit our ability to deliver commercial e mail messages to consumers 
the federal trade commission is convening a three day workshop to review commercial e mail practices 
there are presently no federal laws that explicitly regulate sending unsolicited e mail 
the pending federal bills and existing state laws require that certain opt out procedures be included in e mails and prohibit false routing or fictitious address information 
existing state  and pending federal  laws require functioning return e mail addresses and that valid postal addresses be included by the senders of commercial e mail messages 
some states require an adv label in the subject line  and proscribe false header or misleading subject lines 
attorneys general and or consumers are given authority to enforce the state laws 
over half the states have enacted legislation affecting the sending of unsolicited commercial e mail 
if strict federal legislation is subsequently written into law  with its terms specifically limiting our ability to market our offers  we could potentially realize a material adverse impact in future fiscal period net revenue growth  and therefore  profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected 
in november  we received an inquiry from the federal trade commission questioning whether we needed to comply with the graham leach bliley act privacy of consumer information for financial institutions arising from atlas credit group  one of our internet subsidiaries 
we responded by stating that we need not comply with the graham leach bliley act because atlas credit group utilizes advertising from other financial institutions  but is not itself a financial institution as defined under the statute 
we have not received any further comments from the federal trade commission 
thanksmuch 
com  llc  another of our internet subsidiaries  was served with a class action lawsuit in state court in the county of los angeles  california  for damages associated with allegedly violating the state s shipping and handling laws 
this suit was recently settled 
the settlement offers a certificate to california consumers on future purchases of thanksmuch products and provides a small payment for attorneys fees 
the pennsylvania attorney general s office had requested us to enter into an assurance of voluntary compliance agreement to resolve allegations concerning certain of our sales practices 
the attorney general alleged that our fly free telemarketing program  as well as certain pay per call services  did not adequately disclose to the consumer the terms of the offer being made 
the agreement also provides for a payment to the state in an amount yet to be determined 
discussions with the pennsylvania attorney general s office are on going 
any changes in the internet operating landscape that materially hinders our current ability and or cost to deliver commercial e mail messages to the consumer records in our databases  and the consumer records in the databases of our affiliates  could potentially cause a material impact on net revenue and gross margin and  therefore  our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected 
revenue from our e commerce segment s grouplotto and other web sites sub set for fiscal was million  which was an increase in revenues of million  or  to fiscal million in revenue 
this increase is the result of our shift from low priced click through revenue to higher revenue generating registration  lead generation and on line customer acquisition based revenue 
we generate a significant portion of our site traffic from email marketing 
as discussed in the prior paragraph  any change in the internet operating landscape such as the enactment of additional state and federal legislation that materially hinders our ability and or cost to deliver commercial email messages to consumers could potentially cause a material adverse impact on net revenue and gross margin and  therefore  our profitability and cash flows 
additional increases in our consolidated revenues were attributable to new sub sets added to the e commerce segment during the year ended november  when compared to the year ended november  the combined revenue resulting from the new sub sets amounted to approximately million and is detailed as follows a  of such increase relates to our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management  llc  that provides services under a net branch agreement with licensed mortgage banking and brokerage companies in the acquisition of candidates for new mortgages and the refinancing of existing debt  which subsidiary also conducts the same services off line and recorded approximately million within our off line marketing services segment  b million of such increase relates to the on line sales of jewelry and gifts by our new subsidiary  thanksmuch  inc  which was formed after the acquisition of the assets of a closely held private company on december   all as more fully described in note to the financial statements  c  of such increase relates to the internet game development revenues generated by our new subsidiary  infiknowledge ulc  which was formed after the acquisition of the assets of a closely held private canadian company on december   all as more fully described in note to the financial statements  and d the balance of such increase  or  was attributable to a web marketing  design and development contract executed and completed by us during the three months ended february  the increases in revenues from our e commerce segment and off line marketing services segment were partially offset by a decrease of  in revenues from our lec billed products and services segment 
a portion of the decrease  or  resulted from the expiration in the three months ended february   of certain agreements pursuant to which we had been paid a royalty fee with virtually no corresponding costs to refrain from conducting  marketing  advertising or promoting certain lec billed products and services 
fiscal did not include any revenue related to these services  but we do expect such segment to become active again during the first quarter of fiscal  resulting from the marketing of our products and services that will be billed to consumers on their phone bills through the lecs 
the balance of the decrease in lec billed product and service segment revenue  or  resulted from our elimination of billing voice mail services under our contract with the service bureau federal transtel  inc ftt in october ftt has since filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code

our cost of revenues during the years ended november  and  are comprised of direct and indirect marketing costs associated with the acquisition and retention of consumers for our databases  including direct response email marketing costs  data purchases  promotional costs and premium fulfillment costs  and the related contingent based prize indemnification expense  and lec segment related billing and collection fees  and customer service costs

our continuing strategy of generating revenues primarily from direct marketing campaigns delivered on line was the significant factor contributing to this increase 
we realized marketing costs for email delivery of approximately million in the year ended november   representing an increase of million  or  when compared to approximately million in email delivery costs incurred in the year ended november  in december  we acquired the assets of a canadian based technology company infiknowledge 
we believe that the integration of infiknowledge s assets  technology and human resources into our operations and email delivery platform will continue to reduce the unitary costs of our email promotions and serve to preserve and or improve operating margins 
see the preceding net revenue section for a further discussion of recent business and legal developments attributable to email marketing 
we realized costs of approximately million for data purchases necessary to build and maintain our marketing databases and approximately million for premium costs related to premium redemption obligations for certain of our marketing program offers 
these costs represent an increase of approximately million  or  over data purchase and fulfillment costs of approximately million incurred during the year ended november  in the prior fiscal year  we incurred approximately  in costs relative to premium redemption obligations 
the costs associated with data purchase increases were due  in combination  to our a increasing the volume of data acquired for our marketing activities and b our increased allocation of data purchases for opt in data 
we use the services of an agency for the provision of indemnification coverage in the event the grouplotto site produces a winner in one of its free on line lottery games 
the costs attributable to the provision of such indemnification coverage decreased in fiscal approximately  or  when compared with fiscal the primary reason for this decrease was due to a slight decrease in the games played at the grouplotto 
com website during the year ended november  when compared to the year ended november  our off line marketing services segment s cost of sales decreased  or  to  when compared to  during the year ended november  the fiscal off line marketing services segment s cost of sales result from our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management llc  which was consolidated with our activities effective september  prior to such consolidation  the subsidiary was primarily inactive 
in the fiscal year ended november   our off line marketing services segment primarily consisted of a contingent marketing fee that became payable upon the settlement of related litigation  in which we were granted an arbitration award  thus triggering the contingency 
the balance of the decrease in cost of goods sold relates to the lec billed product and services segment and amounted to a reduction of  this reduction resulted from our elimination of billing voice mail services under our contract with the service bureau federal transtel  inc ftt in october ftt has since filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy code

on a segmental basis  our e commerce segment realized a decrease in margin in fiscal when compared to fiscal the absolute percentage point decrease resulted from our increased costs associated with data purchases which are fully expensed at the time of receipt and a significant increase in premium fulfillment obligation costs 
we anticipate that the immediate expensing policy regarding data purchases could provide a margin improvement benefit in future fiscal periods through the continued marketing to such acquired data 
the costs of premium fulfillment obligations related to our marketing of a program for a long distance service provider  with such costs approximating million in the year ended november  we began marketing this premium fulfillment sensitive program in the fourth quarter of fiscal  pursuant to which we incurred approximately  in accrued premium fulfillment costs 
offsetting the decrease in gross margins  as described above  our gross margin benefited from the acquisition of the assets of infiknowledge 
the infiknowledge asset acquisition allowed us to develop our own email delivery platform  through which we were able to decrease our reliance on third party email vendors 
by decreasing this third party reliance  we were able to decrease the unitary costs relative to email delivery 
changes in the gross margins generated from our off line marketing services segment and lec billed product and services segment primarily offset each other in terms of percentage changes 
see the previous discussions of net revenues and cost of sales for a more detailed discussion of such segments

the significant factors contributing to the increase in selling expenses were a increased fee share commissions incurred in our e commerce segment of approximately million  and b increased selling based commissions and compensation costs million and  respectively arising from the expansion of the e commerce segment s sales force and selling activities 
regarding the increase in fee share commissions  during the fiscal year ended november   we significantly expanded the practice of marketing promotional offers on behalf of our marketing clients clients to third party databases on a fee share commission basis 
the fee share commission relationship generally arises after we conclude a contractual arrangement with a client pursuant to which we modify or develop the copy  offer form and promotional materials for the client s product or service 
we then test the promotion  and agree to deliver a minimum level of new customers  and or targeted leads to the client 
simultaneously with the execution of these contractual arrangements  we often obtain the rights from the client to market its promotions to a list of third parties with whom we have marketing relationships the third parties 
we enter into contracts with each third party with whom we intend to market client promotions 
the terms of these agreements generally provide that the third party has the right to i approve the creative materials for each promotion  ii approve the timing of each promotion s mailing  iii terminate the contract on short notice  and iv reject any promotion for any reason 
each agreement also restricts the third party from doing business with the client other than through our company for the period of time covered by the agreement  and sets forth the terms of the third party s compensation 
payments are performance based only and are either fixed fees paid for each customer or lead generated for the client  or a revenue share that is a percentage of the revenue generated after deduction for certain direct costs by us for marketing that offer to the third party database 
we utilize unique universal resource locater identifier links urls when promotions are mailed to the third party database 
it is the unique url s that form the tracking mechanism by which the client reports results to us  and we are able to account for revenue generated under the fee share arrangement with third parties 
during the fiscal year ended november   we significantly increased the number of third party databases and lists under management  which is the primary factor contributing to the increase in the fee share commissions expense category 
additionally  the other commission expense category increase was attributable to agency commissions paid on the sales to one of our largest customers  which customer is no longer conducting business with us see transactions with major customers 
selling expenses within the off line marketing services segment for fiscal increased approximately million  or  when compared to the prior year s comparable period 
this increase is attributable to the activities of our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management  llc 
this subsidiary was active for the entire fiscal year ended november   whereas in fiscal such subsidiary was only active for the fourth quarter

these losses were deemed to be other than temporary 
additionally  during the year ended november   we realized a permanent impairment of  on a long term investment in an entity that discontinued its operations in fiscal we believe that we have significantly reduced our exposure to market fluctuations in our investment portfolio by limiting the contents of such portfolio to approximately million in high grade  short term  commercial paper and auction rate securities with yields ranging from to  with maturities of to days  and approximately million in higher risk investments  consisting of common stock equities and real estate investment trust equities

provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate is a result of the combination of federal income taxes at statutory rates  and state taxes  subject to the effects of valuation allowances taken against the realizability of deferred tax assets 
we recorded income tax expense of  for the year ended november  on pre tax income of  this equates to an effective tax rate of approximately 
this effective tax rate is similar to our historically recognized tax rate 
in the year ended november   we realized previously devalued deferred tax assets related to capital losses see note to the financial statements for further details of our income tax accounts 
we had recorded income tax expense of  for the year ended november  on a pre tax profit of approximately  this effective tax rate relationship is the result of our taking a full valuation allowance during the year ended november  against the future tax benefits attributable to the loss carryovers arising from permanent impairment charges of  incurred during such period 
this deferred tax asset valuation allowance had been recorded during the year ended november   due to the absence of appreciated capital gain property available for the potential generation of capital gain income to offset the net capital losses generated by the impairment charges

this increase was specifically attributable to the company s e commerce segment  which recognized a net increase in revenue of approximately million  offset by combined declines in net revenue from the company s legacy segments of approximately million 
the e commerce segment revenue increase resulted from the company s increasing focus on generating revenue from its current core business  on line direct marketing 
the company expects this segment to continue to represent a substantial part of the company s revenue in future fiscal periods 
as a percentage of consolidated net revenue  the company s on line direct marketing activities constituted of fiscal revenues  compared to in fiscal the declines in the company s off line customer acquisition services segment decrease of million and lec billed products and services segment decrease of million were attributable to the company s termination of the active marketing of such products and services during prior fiscal periods and the company s intentional migration to the internet for the generation of the bulk of its revenue 
the company s on line revenues are generated on a higher margin basis when compared to such legacy segments operating activities 
this migration commenced at the end of the fiscal year ended november  fiscal and became fully implemented during fiscal during the year ended november   the company executed an on line customer acquisition program for a prominent long distance service provider 
under such arrangement  the company generated approximately million of revenue in fiscal  specifically during the fourth quarter 
this represented and of consolidated net revenues for fiscal and the fourth quarter thereof  respectively 
the company s agreement with such long distance carrier terminated during the first quarter of the fiscal year ending november  fiscal 
although the company has entered into a new agreement with such long distance carrier  the company anticipates that the impact thereof on fiscal periods beyond the first quarter of fiscal will not be material 
the revenue generated in fiscal from the company s original agreement with this long distance carrier  coupled with the on line portion of the talk 
com settlement more fully described below of approximately million  accounted for fiscal s  of long distance customer acquisitions sub segment revenue included in the company s e commerce segment 
this represented a decline in such sub segment of approximately  when compared to fiscal fiscal s e commerce long distance customer acquisition sub segment revenues were entirely attributable to talk 
com customer acquisition activity prior to the october termination of the company s agreement therewith 
the net growth in the company s e commerce segment was primarily attributable to an approximate million increase in revenue generated from the company s e mail marketing programs  as compared to only  of revenues during fiscal this substantial increase of approximately over the prior year was the result of the company generating significantly more on line generated consumer data and a number of on line contracts with new customers during the fiscal year ended november  during the prior year  the company had not significantly penetrated this method of revenue generation 
during the second half of fiscal  the company began the practice of marketing e mail promotional offers to third party databases on a revenue share basis 
the company becomes obligated to pay these third parties only when a transaction occurs and payment is made to the company by the third parties whose promotion was mailed 
these fee share basis revenues provide operating income at a reduced operating margin when compared to e mail promotional offers mailed to the company s proprietary database 
the company reports the fees paid to the owners of the third party databases as a component of selling expenses 
it is the company s intent to limit fiscal s fee share basis expenses to approximately of consolidated revenues  compared to approximately in fiscal the second material factor contributing to the growth of the company s e commerce segment was the approximately million in on line data sales and rentals generated in fiscal when compared to a negligible amount generated in fiscal the company believes it was able to identify itself as a source of valuable permission based data and nurtured relationships with third parties to facilitate the sale and rental of such data 
the third material factor contributing to the growth of the company s e commerce segment was the approximately million or increase in net revenues earned from the grouplotto and other website sub segment 
the grouplotto site has developed increased brand recognition on the internet and has enabled the company s sales force to increase its revenue generating customer base on the site 
during the year ended november   the company was successful in its legal action against talk america  inc talk  resulting in an approximate million arbitration award 
the award represented restitution for long distance customers delivered to talk  and for lost profits suffered by the company due to talk s wrongful termination of an agreement between the parties 
this wrongful termination occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recognized million of revenue of consolidated fiscal revenues  this represented talk s acceptance of such delivered customers  thus fulfilling the company s revenue recognition criteria 
from the settlement during the year ended november   resulting from the receipt of talk s first of two installments due on the total award 
the first installment was comprised of approximately million of revenue attributable to the long distance customer acquisition sub segment of the company s e commerce segment 
the balance of the first installment  or approximately million of revenue  was attributable to the company s off line customer acquisition legacy segment primarily telemarketing 
the company recognized an approximate million contingent telemarketing cost as a result of this settlement 
this contingent cost is discussed in further detail in the following cost of goods sold section 
the second  and final  installment of approximately million  plus interest at  is due on april  if the company receives the second installment in fiscal  it will record the revenue at that time 
the company expects that the segment distribution of such second installment will be as follows a approximately million of e commerce revenue within that segment s long distance customer acquisition sub segment  and b approximately million of off line customer acquisition segment revenue 
based on the telecommunications industry s present weakened state of financial affairs  and specifically management s estimation of talk s ability to pay  management determined that the second installment of the settlement was a gain contingency and  as such  will record any related revenue only upon collection 
during the year ended november   revenues from the company s majority owned subsidiary  montvale management llc  contributed approximately  or of consolidated net revenues 
the subsidiary generates revenue by operating under net branch agreements  whereby it originates residential mortgages and refinancings for licensed mortgage banking and brokerage companies 
the subsidiary became active as a result of reduced mortgage and refinance loan interest rates  and increased government funds for low income homebuyers 
the subsidiary s revenue was generated through on line sources  included in the e commerce segment and through conventional marketing efforts  consisting of outbound telemarketing  direct mail and print media  included in the off line customer acquisition segment 
pursuant to a full year of consolidated operations  and management s anticipation that the interest rate environment will remain stable and beneficial to new homebuyers and people interested in refinancing  the company anticipates that the subsidiary will generate significantly more revenue in the fiscal year ending november  see transactions with major customers and termination of economic dependence  prior year transactions impacting current and future fiscal periods and service bureaus and local exchange carriers following the liquidity and capital resources section for a detailed discussion of other revenue decreases as they relate to the company s comparative and future revenues 
in the fiscal periods prior to november   the company s cost of revenues were offset by net revenue generated from certain premium offerings made in conjunction with the company s marketing of other products and services 
the company terminated the marketing of these products and services in conjunction with the transaction agreements  all as more fully described in prior year transactions impacting current and future fiscal periods 
all such residual revenue from those premium offerings have been reflected in the company s other income expense section

the company s increased focus on generating revenues from direct marketing campaigns delivered on line was the primary factor contributing to this increase 
during the course of the year  the company realized increased costs for e mailing on an absolute basis approximate increase of million over  for fiscal  but recognized decreased costs on a per unit basis for e mail services obtained from third party e mailers 
as of the fourth quarter of fiscal  the price of third party e mail service provision was in the range of 
to per thousand e mails sent 
in prior fiscal periods  the company paid as much as per thousand e mails sent 
this per unit price reduction is the contributing factor that enabled the company to increase e mail related revenue approximately  while recognizing a smaller  increase in e mail and related delivery costs over the comparable prior year 
in december  the company acquired the assets of a canadian based technology company and  with the integration of this entity in fiscal  the company believes it will further reduce the unitary costs of its e mailing promotions 
the company uses the services of an agency for the provision of indemnification coverage in the event the grouplotto site produces a winner in one of its free on line lottery games 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company restructured its lottery game prizes and concurrently reduced the costs of the related premiums for the indemnification coverage 
this premium cost savings was realized in the year ended november  and is reflected by a indemnification cost decrease  compared to a increase in related revenues generated at the grouplotto site 
in october  the company had a million winner on its grouplotto site 
the indemnification agency acknowledged the winner s claim  awarded payment  and the company did not incur any additional expense beyond the premiums 
additionally  the company s premium costs per game did not increase as a result of the winner s claim 
the company s off line customer acquisition segment had been primarily inactive for the first nine months of fiscal during the fourth quarter  the company received the first of the two scheduled installments from the talk arbitration victory and recorded a portion of the revenue in the off line customer acquisition segment 
pursuant to the receipt of the first installment in november  the company recorded its obligation to make an approximate million contingent payment to a telemarketing vendor for their services performed for the company relating to marketing for talk 
the company does not have any other contingent liabilities related to the second  and final  settlement installment that is scheduled for receipt in april in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company released approximately  in excess premium accruals from terminated off line customer acquisition marketing programs

the company s off line customer acquisition services segment s gross margin declined to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the percentage point decline resulted from the costs of a contingent liability realized upon the settlement of the arbitration dispute with talk 
the contingency was of a higher cost relationship to revenues than historically recognized within the segment  due to the fact that the total contingency became payable as a result of the first installment 
the second installment will not have any contingent payables if such second installment is collected in fiscal to the extent that the balance of the talk settlement is received in fiscal  the company will report gross margin in its off line customer acquisition segment in excess of

the significant factors contributing to the increase in selling expenses were a increased fee share commissions incurred in the company s e commerce segment of approximately million see below for a detailed description of this expense category  and b increased compensation and related selling costs  and  respectively arising from the expansion of the company s e commerce segment s sales force and selling activities 
regarding the increase in fee share commissions  in the second half of fiscal  the company significantly expanded the practice of marketing promotional offers on behalf of its marketing clients clients to third party databases on a fee share commission basis 
the fee share commission relationship generally arises after the company concludes a contractual arrangement with a client pursuant to which the company modifies or develops the copy  offer form and promotional materials for the client s product or service 
the company then tests the promotion  and agrees to deliver a minimum level of new customers  and or targeted leads to the client 
simultaneously with the execution of these contractual arrangements  the company obtains the exclusive rights from the client to market their promotions to a list of third parties with whom the company has marketing relationships the third parties 
the company enters into contracts with each third party with whom it intends to market client promotions 
the terms of these agreements generally provide that the third party has the right to i approve the creative materials for each promotion  ii approve the timing of each promotion s mailing  iii terminate the contract on short notice  and iv reject any promotion for any reason 
each agreement sets forth the terms of the third party s compensation  which range from fixed fees paid for each customer or lead  generated for the client  to a revenue share that is a percentage of the revenue generated after deduction for certain direct costs by the company for marketing that offer to the third party database 
the company utilizes unique universal resource locater identifier links urls when promotions are mailed to the third party database 
it is the unique url s that form the tracking mechanism by which the client reports results to the company  and the company is able to account for revenue generated under the fee share arrangement with third parties 
selling expenses within the company s off line customer acquisition services segment declined  or  in fiscal  when compared to fiscal the company expects that in the fiscal year ended november  it will realize an increase in this segment s selling expenses 
the anticipated increase arises from the company s expected expansion of the operations of its majority owned subsidiary  montvale management llc  which conducts business off line  as well as on line  as a net branch for licensed mortgage banking and brokerage companies

additionally  during the year ended november   the company had evaluated its long term investments specifically within the quarter ended february  and during the period march  to april  and determined that an investment made in a privately held company during fiscal was impaired 
a long lived asset impairment write down  related to this continuing evaluation  of  was charged to the permanent impairment charge account during the year ended november  during fiscal this entity effectively wound down operations and ceased doing business  and d the reduction in the pre tax net income attributable to the residual activity related to the company s terminated legacy business  as such activity decreased to a loss of approximately  in fiscal  from income of approximately million in the year ended november provision for income taxes the company s effective income tax rate is a result of the combination of federal income taxes at statutory rates  and state taxes  subject to the effects of valuation allowances taken against the realizability of deferred tax assets

the majority of our customers are extended day credit terms 
we continually monitor customer adherence to such terms and constantly strive to improve the effectiveness of our collection efforts with the goal of achieving a dso in the day range 
future fiscal periods might not reflect this goal of a day dso  and might exceed the day dso recognized during the year ended november  cash used in financing activities during the year ended november  amounted to million  and included cash outflows of approximately million for purchases of our common stock  primarily in open market transactions with  shares retired  and the balance of  held in treasury 
it is our intention to retire all treasury shares in the quarter ending february  on june   we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan  which allowed for the buyback of up to two million shares of our outstanding common stock 
under such plan  we acquired  shares for  at an average price of per share in open market transactions 
the above referenced financing cash outflows were partially offset by cash proceeds generated by the exercise of stock options  which amounted to approximately  and approximately  in proceeds net of related costs and income taxes related to an insider trading action brought against a former non management insider  pursuant to which such insider was required to return to us his deemed insider trading gains 
historically  our primary cash requirements have been used to fund the cost of advertising and promotion  with additional funds having been used in the purchasing of equipment and services in connection with the commencement of new business lines  further development of businesses being test marketed and for the development of the equipment infrastructure of newly formed subsidiaries resulting from asset purchases 
during the fiscal year ended november   we commenced our on line direct marketing strategy 
our future plans and business strategy continue to call for our internet based e commerce segment to be our primary operating focus  with such segment generating a material portion of future revenues 
if our on line activities fail to generate sufficient revenue  then the continuation of our year over year on line growth in that segment could have a material adverse impact on our capital and liquidity resources relating to possible expenditures for a marketing campaigns  b product development costs  c site development and maintenance and related technology based costs  d potential on line  and or off line  business acquisitions  e costs associated with developing alternative means of email promotion delivery  or f other unexpected and or currently unidentifiable costs 
during the year ended november   we expended approximately million in capital expenditures to support our e commerce activities and administrative activities 
obsolescence  changes in the internet operating landscape  government regulation and or other unexpected events impacting internet direct marketing  or the economy in general  could individually  or in combination have an adverse effect on the carrying value of the capital expenditures procured in fiscal  as well as the carrying value of other asset acquisitions made in fiscal and earlier that have not yet been fully depreciated or amortized 
in december  we acquired the assets of infiknowledge  a closely held private canadian based internet technology company 
we believe that this acquisition will continue to decrease certain costs relative to our reliance on third parties in the provision of emailing services and other internet hosting services 
the realization of those proposed cost savings require capital expenditures by the newly formed entity  with the funding of such expenditures being provided by us 
to date such capital expenditures approximated million 
during the nine month period ended november   we experienced problems with the delivery of our email promotional offers 
such problems reduced revenue and income from the e commerce sub segment 
we believe that the significant component of the email delivery problem is attributable to internet service providers that unilaterally block commercial emails from reaching their consumer subscribers 
we have addressed the issue by deploying new reinforced delivery platforms with increased redundancy and expanded diversification using both internal and external emailing resources 
although we have conceived of a number of programs to address this specific problem  there can be no assurance that any of these programs will work effectively  or can be timely implemented 
any further changes in the internet operating landscape that materially hinders our ability and or cost to deliver commercial email messages to the consumer records in our databases  and the consumer records in the databases of our affiliates  could potentially cause a material adverse impact in future fiscal period net revenue growth and gross margin  and  therefore  our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected 
there are a variety of legislative proposals at state and federal levels regarding email marketing 
certain of these proposals  if implemented  could negatively affect our email marketing programs which could cause a material adverse impact in future fiscal period net revenue  profitability and cash flows 
should the business climate  internet operating environment or technology environment change significantly  we could be faced with circumstances that would limit or prevent our utilization of these capital expenditures 
we expended approximately  in cash in fiscal as partial consideration for the infiknowledge asset acquisition net of cash received of approximately 
we also expended an additional  on december  fiscal  regarding the final cash installment related to the infiknowledge asset acquisition 
in december  we also acquired the assets of thanksmuch 
com  a closely held private company for approximately  net of cash received of approximately 
we do not anticipate that this asset acquisition will require significant capital expenditures to maintain or improve its operations and we have not made significant capital expenditures regarding such entity to the date of this filing 
in september  we disbursed  in final settlement of an arbitration award 
the total payments made exceeded the award by approximately  the excess related to an additional settlement agreement that precludes the claimants from further proceeding with the action in civil court 
the total disbursement of million was made during the three months ended november   and is reflected on the income statement as a component of other non operating income expense for the year then ended 
we received final notice regarding the internal revenue service tax audits covering the years to the final notice of settlement approximated  was paid in november  and included unbilled interest expense on such tax audits 
we had provided for the income statement impact of such outlay in a prior year and  therefore  the outlay has not impacted earnings in the quarter ended november  during the fiscal year ended november   our internet business plan and strategy prompted us to terminate the active marketing of our legacy products and services 
accordingly  this legacy activity may contribute  but in a significantly decreasing degree  to our cash flows and net income in subsequent fiscal periods  as was the case during the year ended november  when compared to the years ended november  and this should be considered when using our historical results in evaluating future operations  cash flows and financial position 
nevertheless  we will continue to explore opportunities to offer other off line marketing services and  for fiscal  have reentered the lec billed products and services market 
under current operating plans and assumptions  management believes that projected cash flows from operations and available cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
currently  we do not have any material long term obligations other than those described in the note commitments and contingent liabilities included in the financial statements included in this document  nor have we identified any long term obligations that we contemplate incurring in the near future 
we are currently considering the acquisition of a building in canada to house our technology and email platforms 
the estimated price range of such building  with necessary improvements  is not expected to exceed  additionally  we anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate million in the upcoming fiscal year  the majority of which will be for computer and related peripheral equipment to be used in our e commerce activities 
as we seek to further extend our reach into the e commerce arena  as well as identify new and other consumer oriented products and services in the off line arena  we may use existing cash reserves  long term financing  or other means to finance such diversification 
transactions with major customers during the year ended november   we had major customers in our e commerce segment  which in combination accounted for approximately million of consolidated net revenue  respectively  or of consolidated net revenues 
approximately million  or of consolidated net accounts receivable was attributable to such major customer group as of november  the five major customers referenced above accounted for    and of consolidated net revenue  respectively  for the year ended november  of the remaining approximate active customers in the year ended november   no other single customer had net revenue that equaled or exceeded of consolidated net revenue 
we continued to conduct business with these major customers as of january   with the exception of the customer that accounted for of our net revenue for the year ended november  this customer had notified us in september that it was exercising its right to terminate the relationship in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement  and  as such  had phased out its business with us during the ninety day period ended december  see year ended november  compared to year ended november  for a more detailed discussion of the impact of such termination on our operations and cash flows 
during the year ended november   we had six major customers  five within our e commerce segment and one within our off line marketing services segment  which  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of consolidated net revenues during the year ended november   and approximately of consolidated net accounts receivable as of november  critical accounting policy and accounting estimate discussion in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s the commission release nos 
  and fr issued in december  referencing the commission s statement regarding the selection and disclosure by public companies of critical accounting policies and practices  we have set forth below what we believe to be the most pervasive accounting policies and estimates that could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows if general business conditions or individual customer financial circumstances change in an adverse way relative to the policies and estimates used in the attached financial statements or in any forward looking statements contained herein 
factors that could effect future results revenue recognition  variable costs and bad debts we currently earn the most significant portion of our revenue from the e commerce segment pursuant to marketing agreements with marketing partners and corporate customers 
the provisions of each agreement determine the type and timing of revenue to be recorded 
we invoice our customers in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement 
revenue is recognized at the time the marketing activity is delivered  or service is provided  net of estimated contractually specified data qualification allowances  when applicable 
such data qualification allowances may include duplications  invalid addresses  age restrictions and allowances  and are recorded as contra revenue 
our revenues are adjusted in later fiscal periods if actual allowances vary from amounts previously estimated 
historically  the variance between actual allowances and previously estimated allowances has been immaterial 
if events were to occur that would cause actual allowances which are recorded as offsets against gross revenue  as contra revenues  in arriving at reported net revenue to vary significantly from those originally estimated and reflected in the financial statements  we could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period gross margins  and  therefore  our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected 
certain obligations are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
they include costs payable to other on line  as well as off line  advertisers for registered user acquisitions and consumer data  fee sharing costs under third party database use agreements  email message delivery costs  contingent based prize indemnification coverage for potential free on line lottery winners  premium fulfillment costs related to the respective promotion and all other variable costs directly associated with completing our obligations relative to the revenue being recognized 
should the internet operating landscape change resulting in a higher costs of acquiring consumer data and registered users for our websites  b higher costs of acquiring data for our marketing partners  compromising such marketing partners ability to maintain adequate databases to allow for continued third party database use agreements  c the infiknowledge asset acquisition failing to reduce the cost of our email delivery activities and other web hosting service costs  or us being required to depend on third party emailing service bureaus to provide an increased portion of our commercial email delivery at a cost in excess of anticipated internally generated costs  or other third party influence on our ability to deliver email messages to the records in our databases  or the records in our marketing affiliates databases  d our contingent based prize indemnification premiums for indemnification coverage increasing due to an increase in the number of prize winners at the site  as a result of the insurance industry in general  or other currently unknown factors  e our accruals for fulfillment obligations arising out of promotions proving to be less than the actual redemptions processed in subsequent fiscal periods  or f unpredictable technology changes or commercial technology applications  then  if any one  or a combination  of the above factors were to materialize we could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period revenue growth and gross margins  and  therefore  our profitability and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
revenue recognition is also subject to provisions based on the probability of collection of the related trade accounts receivable 
we continuously evaluate the potential of the collectibility of trade receivables by reviewing such factors as deterioration in the operating results  financial condition  or bankruptcy filings  of our customers 
as a result of this review process  we record bad debt provisions to adjust the related receivables carrying amount to an estimated realizable value 
provisions for bad debts are also recorded due to the review of other factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  historical experience and other factors obtained during the conduct of collection efforts 
if circumstances change regarding our specific customers on an individual basis  or if demand for internet direct marketing softens  or if a continuation of the current global economic downturn prevails  our estimates for bad debt provisions could be further increased  which could adversely affect our operating margins  profitability and cash flows 
continuation of major customers  loss of major customer  and prospects of majority owned subsidiary during the year ended november   we had five major customers in our e commerce segment  which in combination accounted for approximately million of consolidated net revenue  or of consolidated net revenues 
approximately million  or of consolidated net accounts receivable  was attributable to such major customers as of november  the five major customers referenced above accounted for    and of consolidated net revenue  respectively  for the year ended november  of the remaining approximate active customers in the year ended november   no other single customer had net revenue that equaled or exceeded of consolidated net revenue 
we continued to conduct business with all such five major customers as of january   with the exception of the customer that accounted for of our net revenue for the year ended november  this customer had notified us in september that it was exercising its right to terminate the relationship in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement  and  as such  had phased out its business with us during the ninety day period ended december  it is our belief that this customer loss will be immaterial at our operations level due to the fact that the operating margin earned from such activity was less than that recognized from our other marketing activities 
we believe that we will be able to use our media channels  creative department and senior management s time  all of which  we believe  were disproportionately dedicated to this customer  more profitably by improving results of existing customer relationships and developing new relationships and proprietary products and services 
we expect an immaterial decline in future fiscal income from operations related to such termination  and look to realize improved margins at both the contribution and operating level 
additionally  we anticipate that we will recognize improved contribution and operating margins in future fiscal quarters due to the reduction in our cost of sales that is expected to arise from the elimination of fulfillment costs as they relate to the termination of this contract 
should we not be able to continue conducting business with the balance of our significant customers  or maintain relationships with such companies on equivalent  or similarly favorable terms  or replace the loss of the significant income generated by the lost customer pursuant to our above discussed expectations  or replace any of the other significant customers with other third parties on similar revenue and gross margin generating terms  we could suffer material deterioration in future fiscal period revenue growth and gross margins and  therefore  our profitability and cash flows would be adversely affected 
our potential decreased profitability relative to such possible failure to continue current relationships  or our inability to replace them with new relationships  could be partially mitigated by reductions in our workforce and other cost reducing measures 
it is not known how rapidly we could respond with such measures  if at all 
during the year ended november   our majority owned subsidiary  montvale management llc  contributed approximately million  or of consolidated net revenues 
the subsidiary became active in september the subsidiary generates revenue by operating under net branch agreements  whereby it originates residential mortgages and refinancings for licensed mortgage banking and brokerage companies under such net branch agreement 
the subsidiary business activity increased in fiscal as a result of reduced mortgage and refinance loan interest rates  and increased government funds for low income homebuyers 
our future business plans and operating assumptions anticipate that the subsidiary will contribute an increasing amount of our revenue in terms of absolute dollars  and in terms of percentage of total revenues and operating income 
such assumptions are subject to the continuation of the current interest rate market which favors refinancings  the continued acceptance by the general public of off line and on line marketing promotions for mortgage and mortgage related products  the continued ability of the independently operated majority owned subsidiary to hire and maintain competent staff and management personnel  trained in the specific field of net branch operations  our continued equity ownership interest in such majority owned subsidiary  as well as other factors currently not identifiable 
we can make no assurance that we will realize an increased contribution of revenue and related profits from the majority owned subsidiary in future fiscal periods 
our revenues and profitability from operations have historically varied 
our revenues  cost of providing revenues  profit margins and overhead expenses have varied historically among segments  as well as on a consolidated basis 
the revenue allocation among our segments in future periods will most probably be different than our current revenue allocation due to several factors  including consumer tastes and potential regulatory issues that may exist in future periods and other currently unknown factors that could restrict our revenue generating cycle or cost structure 
therefore  it is difficult to predict revenue and gross margin trends 
actual trends may cause us to adjust our operating emphasis  which could result in continued period to period fluctuations in our results of operations 
historically  we have had to react to rapid changes in the business environment within which we operate 
management responded to these rapid changes as deemed appropriate at the time of change  and as dictated by the nature of such changes 
management s reaction to such changes covered a broad range of business related adjustments  ranging from product mix repositioning and staff reductions  to entire business model overhauls 
based on our current operations and marketing methods  as well as the still emerging status of the internet marketing environment  it is possible that management could institute significant changes to our business model in response to unforeseen rapid changes in future fiscal periods 
impairment of goodwill  other intangibles and investment portfolios could impact net income we carry goodwill and other intangibles on our balance sheet arising from current and prior year acquisitions 
we must review  at least annually  such goodwill and other intangibles for any asset impairment 
if the review of the goodwill and intangibles related to the subsidiaries organized to acquire such assets determine that such assets are impaired  then we will be required to recognize an impairment charge on such goodwill necessary to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its net realizable value 
should events occur that would give rise to such impairment charge  we would recognize decreased profitability to the extent of such adjustment 
cash flows would not be directly affected by the impairment charge  but cash flows would  most likely  be adversely affected as a result of the facts and circumstances that created the impairment charge 
market fluctuation and debt repayment risk of marketable securities investment portfolio we maintain an investment portfolio that is managed by prominent financial institutions 
the portfolio includes high grade corporate commercial paper and auction rate securities  equity securities of real estate investment trusts reits and common stock equities  all of which are held for varying periods of time  pursuant to maturity dates  market conditions and other factors 
the fair value of our investments in the common stock of publicly traded companies  as of november  amounted to approximately million 
these investments are subject to market price volatility  in addition to the potential for business failure at the company level 
moreover  due to the economic downturn and difficulties that may be faced by some of the companies in which we have investments  our investment portfolio could be further impaired by the failure of such companies to fulfill their responsibility of adhering to the repayment of principal upon maturity 
additionally  our cash flows and interest income could be negatively impacted from continued federal reserve bank interest rate reductions 
potential of federal  and or state enacted legislation there are a variety of legislative proposals at state and federal levels regarding email marketing  as discussed elsewhere herein 
certain of these proposals  if implemented  could negatively affect our email marketing programs which could cause a material adverse impact in net revenue  gross margins  profitability and cash flows
