item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk community banks  inc has only virtually no involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes 
these derivatives are embedded in their host contract and are not required to be bifurcated 
the business of the corporation and the composition of its balance sheet consists of investments in interest earning assets primarily loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  which are primarily funded by interest bearing liabilities deposits and borrowings 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market interest rates resulting in market risk 
other than loans  which are originated and held for sale  all of the financial instruments of the corporation are for other than trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments are different  creating a risk that changes in the level of market interest rates will result in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  the corporation s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the corporation s exposure to interest rate sensitivity is managed primarily through the corporation s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which generate favorable earnings  while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
since the corporation s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  its ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer preferences in the market areas in which it operates 
borrowings  which include federal home loan bank fhlb advances and short term loans  subordinated notes  and other short term and long term borrowings are generally structured with specific terms which in management s judgement  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  mitigate the corporation s exposure to interest rate sensitivity 
the rates  terms and interest rate indices of the corporation s interest earning assets result primarily from its strategy of investing in loans and securities a substantial portion of which have adjustable rate terms which permit the corporation to limit its exposure to interest rate sensitivity  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread compared to the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
significant assumptions utilized in managing interest rate sensitivity managing the corporation s exposure to interest rate sensitivity involves significant assumptions about the exercise of embedded options and the relationship of various interest rate indices of certain financial instruments 
embedded options a substantial portion of the corporation s loans and mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage loans contain significant embedded options  which permit the borrower to prepay the principal balance of the loan prior to maturity prepayments without penalty 
a loan s propensity for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  including the current interest rate and interest rate index if any of the loan  the financial ability of the borrower to refinance  the economic benefit to be obtained from refinancing  availability of refinancing at attractive terms  as well as economic and other factors in specific geographic areas which affect the sales and price levels of residential property 
in a changing interest rate environment  prepayments may increase or decrease on fixed and adjustable rate loans pursuant to the current relative levels and expectations of future short and long term interest rates 
investment securities  other than mortgage backed securities and those with early call provisions  generally do not have significant embedded options and repay pursuant to specific terms until maturity 
while savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice  a continuing relationship with such customers is generally predictable resulting in a dependable and uninterrupted source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  while term fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes have prepayment penalties  which discourage customer withdrawal of time deposits and prepayment by the corporation of fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes prior to maturity 
interest rate indices the corporation s loans and mortgage backed securities are primarily indexed to the national interest indices 
when such loans and mortgage backed securities are funded by interest bearing liabilities which are determined by other indices  usually deposits and fhlb borrowings  a changing interest rate environment may result in different levels of changes in the indices leading to disproportionate changes in the value of  and net earnings generated from  the corporation s financial instruments 
each index is unique and is influenced by different external factors  therefore  the historical relationships in various indices may not be indicative of the actual change which may result in a changing interest rate environment 
interest rate sensitivity measurement in addition to periodic gap reports comparing the sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in interest rates  management also utilizes a report which measures the exposure of the corporation s economic value of equity to interest rate risk 
the model calculates the present value of assets  liabilities and equity at current interest rates  and at hypothetically higher and lower interest rates at one percent intervals 
the present value of each major category of financial instruments is calculated by the model using estimated cash flows based on prepayments  early withdrawals  weighted average contractual rates and terms  and discount rates for similar financial instruments 
the resulting present value of longer term fixed rate financial instruments are more sensitive to change in a higher or lower interest rate scenario  while adjustable rate financial instruments largely reflect only a change in present value representing the difference between the contractual and discounted rates until the next interest rate repricing date 
the information provided by these analyses provides some indication of the potential for interest rate adjustment  but does not necessarily mean that the rate adjustment will occur or that it will occur in accordance with the assumptions 
despite these inherent limitations  community believes that the tools used to manage its level of interest rate risk provide an appropriate measure of market risk exposure 
the following table reflects the estimated present value of assets  liabilities and equity using the model for community banks  inc as of december  at current interest rates and hypothetically  higher and lower interest rates of one and two percent
