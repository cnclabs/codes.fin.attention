item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included in part iv  item of this report  and the risk factors section at the end of this item as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this report  before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment 
in this report  all share numbers and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect our for stock splits  each in the form of a stock dividend  effective february  and february  overview broadcom corporation is the leading provider of highly integrated silicon solutions that enable broadband communications and networking of voice  video and data services 
using proprietary technologies and advanced design methodologies  broadcom designs  develops and supplies complete system on a chip solutions and related hardware and software applications for every major broadband communications market 
our diverse product portfolio includes solutions for digital cable and satellite set top boxes  cable and dsl modems and residential gateways  high speed transmission and switching for local  metropolitan  wide area and storage networking  home and wireless networking  cellular and terrestrial wireless communications  voip  gateway and telephony systems  broadband network processors  and systemi o server solutions 
from broadcom s inception in through  we were primarily engaged in product development and the establishment of strategic customer and foundry relationships 
during that period  we generated the majority of our revenue from development work performed for key customers 
we began shipping our products in  and subsequently our revenue has increased predominantly through sales of our semiconductor products 
we intend to continue to enter into development contracts with key customers  but expect that future development revenue will constitute a small percentage of our total revenue 
we also generate a small percentage of our product revenue from the licensing of software and the provision of software support services and from licenses of system level reference designs 
we utilize independent foundries to manufacture all of our semiconductor products 
net revenue 
the percentage of our net revenue derived from independent customers located outside of the united states was approximately for  for and for all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
from time to time  our key customers have placed large orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly 
we expect these fluctuations will continue 
sales to our significant customers  including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors  as a percentage of net revenue are as follows years ended december  hewlett packard motorola dell com cisco five largest customers as a group less than of net revenue 
includes sales to compaq  which was acquired by hewlett packard in may  for all periods presented 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and for the foreseeable future 
these customers and their respective contributions to our net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 

table of contents gross margin 
our gross margin has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our product mix and volumes  the position of our products in their respective life cycles  the effects of competition and competitive pricing strategies  manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies  fluctuations in direct product costs and overhead costs such as prototyping expenses  amortization of purchased intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  licensing and royalty arrangements  and the mix of product revenue and development revenue 
product cycles 
the cycle for test  evaluation and adoption of our products by customers can range from three to six months or more  with an additional three to nine months or more before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
moreover  in light of the continuing significant economic slowdown in the technology sector  it may take significantly longer than three to nine months before customers commence volume production of equipment incorporating some of our products 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur expenses for research and development  selling  general and administrative efforts  and investments in inventory  and the generation of corresponding revenue  if any 
we anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to month 
if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our results of operations for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  would be materially and adversely affected 
acquisition strategy 
a key element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses  products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market  complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
we plan to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities as they arise  including business combination transactions  strategic partnerships  capital infusions and the purchase or sale of assets 
during  and we completed acquisitions that were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  for original aggregate equity consideration of billion 
in we acquired mobilink telecom  inc  a supplier of chipsets and reference designs for use in cellular phones  cellular modem cards and wireless pdas 
in we acquired visiontech ltd  a supplier of digital video audio mpeg compression and decompression chips  serverworks corporation  a supplier of high performance system input output integrated circuits for servers  workstations and storage platforms  kimalink  a developer of integrated circuits for wireless data communications  and portatec corporation  a developer of integrated solutions for smart mobile devices 
in we acquired innovent systems  inc  a developer of radio frequency integrated circuits for wireless data communications  puyallup integrated circuit company  inc  a provider of integrated circuit design services  altima communications  inc  a supplier of networking integrated circuits for the small to medium sized business networking market  newport communications  inc  a supplier of mixed signal integrated circuits for the high speed communications infrastructure market  silicon spice inc  a developer of communications processors and other technology for high density voice  fax and data packet transmission over wide area networks  element  inc  a developer of high port density  low power digital subscriber line chipsets  software and communications processor technology  allayer communications  a developer of high performance enterprise and optical networking communications chips  and sibyte  inc  a developer of high performance microprocessor solutions for broadband networking 
because each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase transaction  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired 
table of contents companies commencing as of their respective acquisition dates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  during we completed four acquisitions that were accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
these acquisitions included digital furnace corporation  a developer of communications algorithms and software that increase the capacity of existing broadband networks for interactive services  bluesteel networks  inc  a developer of high performance internet security processors for e commerce and vpn applications  stellar semiconductor  inc  a developer of d graphics technology  and pivotal technologies corporation  a developer of high performance communications links for both wired and wireless environments 
because each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a pooling of interests transaction  our historical consolidated financial statements and the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for prior periods have been restated to include the operations of these four companies as if they had been combined with our company at the beginning of the first period presented 
included in restated net revenue and net loss for were revenue and net losses  aggregating  and million  respectively  from the four pooling of interests transactions completed in that year and incurred prior to the respective closings of those transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  warranty reserves  inventory reserves  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations  strategic investments  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances  restructuring costs  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue  receivables and inventory 
we recognize product revenue upon concluding that all of the fundamental criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
the criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment  except for shipments to stocking distributors where revenue is recognized upon sale to the end customer 
in addition  we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and allowances such as competitive pricing programs and rebates 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
our products typically carry a one to three year warranty 
we provide reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting any product failure 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce gross margins 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs could be required 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the 
table of contents net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  or ipr d 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets impact future amortization  and the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii another significant slowdown in the technology sector and the semiconductor industry or a continuation or an increase in severity of the existing significant economic slowdown or iii any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate these assets used in operations  including purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is reasonably possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
strategic investments 
we have made strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
strategic investments with less than a voting interest are generally carried at cost 
we will use the equity method to account for strategic investments in which we have a voting interest of to or in which we otherwise have the ability to exercise significant influence 
under the equity method  the investment is originally recorded at cost and adjusted to recognize our share of net earnings or losses of the investee  limited to the extent of our investment in  advances to and financial guarantees for the investee that create additional basis in the investee 
the share prices of the publicly traded securities have been volatile  and the value of the non publicly traded securities is difficult to determine 
we periodically review these investments for other than temporary declines in fair value based on the specific identification method and write down investments to their fair value  with a corresponding loss recorded in other expense in the statement of operations  when an other than temporary decline has occurred 
we generally believe an other than temporary decline has occurred when the fair value of the investment is below the carrying value for two consecutive quarters  absent evidence to the contrary 
fair values for investments in public companies are determined using their quoted market prices 
fair values for investments in privately held companies are estimated based upon one or more of the following pricing models using historical and forecasted financial information  the values of recent rounds of financing  and or quoted market prices of comparable public companies 
although we believe our estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of the non publicly traded securities held by us  had there been an active market for the equity securities  the carrying values might have been materially different than the amounts reported 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of companies in which we have made such investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying values of the investments that may not be reflected in the investments current carrying values and which could require a future impairment charge 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
as a result of our recent cumulative losses and the full utilization of our loss carryback potential  we recently concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was appropriate 
if  in the future  we believe that 
table of contents we will realize a deferred tax asset which currently has a valuation allowance  we would record a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such determination 
restructuring charges 
over the last several quarters we have undertaken  and we may continue to undertake  significant restructuring initiatives  which have required us to develop formalized plans for exiting certain business activities 
we have had to record estimated expenses for lease cancellations  long term asset write downs  severance and outplacement costs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
through  the accounting rules for restructuring costs and asset impairments required us to record provisions and charges when we had a formal and committed plan 
in calculating the cost to dispose of our excess facilities  we had to estimate our future space requirements and the timing of exiting excess facilities and then estimate for each location the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated and the amount  if any  of sublease income 
this required us to estimate the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated  including the amount of operating costs and the rate at which we might be able to sublease the site 
to form our estimates for these costs  we performed an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site 
our assumptions on future space requirements  the operating costs until termination or the offsetting sublease revenues may turn out to be incorrect  and our actual costs may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs or to reverse previously recorded liabilities 
our policies require us to periodically evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
as management continues to evaluate the business  there may be additional charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated years ended december  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expense research and development selling  general and administrative stock based compensation amortization of purchased intangible assets impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets restructuring costs litigation settlement costs amortization of goodwill in process research and development merger related costs loss from operations interest income  net other expense  net loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss 
table of contents years ended december  and net revenue 
our revenue consists principally of product revenue generated by sales of our semiconductor products  and to a much lesser extent  from development revenue generated under development contracts with our customers and licenses of software and the provision of software support services 
net revenue is revenue less provisions for returns and allowances 
net revenue for was billion  an increase of million or as compared with net revenue of million for net revenue was reduced by million for to account for the fair value of the performance based warrants to purchase shares of class a common stock earned by certain customers in connection with purchase and development agreements that we assumed in prior acquisitions 
no comparable performance based warrants were earned in  and there were no remaining outstanding performance based warrants at december  the increase in net revenue for as compared to resulted primarily from an increase in volume shipments of our enterprise networking and systemi o server products  as well as increased contributions from our emerging businesses  including those in the areas of wireless local area networking  bluetooth  personal video recording and mobile communications applications 
this increase was offset in part by a decrease in shipments of our semiconductor products for digital cable set top boxes and lower average selling prices on cable modem products 
we experienced modest sequential quarterly revenue growth in and expect revenue to continue to grow in the first quarter of gross profit 
gross profit represents net revenue less the cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  packaging  test and quality assurance for semiconductor products  prototyping costs  amortization of purchased technology  and manufacturing overhead  including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  and contracted development work 
gross profit for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or from gross profit of million or of net revenue for the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue resulted primarily from increased volumes and improved yields which reduced subcontractor costs  increased absorption of fixed overhead costs as a result of the increased volumes  and lower stock based compensation expense  offset in part by competitive pricing strategies and amortization of purchased intangible assets 
approximately million and million of stock based compensation expense were included in cost of revenue for and  respectively 
approximately million and million of amortization of purchased intangible assets were included in cost of revenue for and  respectively 
at december  the unamortized balance of purchased intangible assets that will be amortized to cost of revenue in the future was million  of which million and million are expected to be amortized in and  respectively 
we anticipate that gross profit will continue to be impacted by the non cash amortization of acquisition related charges 
in addition  gross profit has been and will likely continue to be impacted in the future by competitive pricing strategies  fluctuations in the volume of our product sales  fluctuations in silicon wafer costs  and possible future changes in product mix and the introduction of certain lower margin products  among other factors 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to engineering design tools  subcontracting costs  systems level testing and prototyping costs  and facilities expenses 
research and development expense does not include expense amounts associated with stock based compensation of employees engaged in research and development or expense amounts associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets related to research and development 
research and development expense for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or as compared with research and development expense of million or of net revenue for the increase in absolute dollars resulted primarily from the addition of personnel through our acquisition of mobilink  certain strategic new hires  and investment in design tools for the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  offset in part by cost 
table of contents reductions from the restructuring plan that we began implementing in the second quarter of as a result of the prolonged significant downturn in the semiconductor industry  in october we announced a new restructuring plan that we began implementing in the fourth quarter of this plan focuses on cost reductions and operating efficiencies  including workforce reductions 
as a result of our october restructuring plan  we anticipate a slight decrease in research and development expense in the near term 
notwithstanding the anticipated immediate impact of our restructuring plan  based upon past experience  we anticipate that research and development expense in absolute dollars will continue to increase over the long term as a result of the growth and diversification of the markets we serve  new product opportunities and any expansion into new markets and technologies 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  professional and legal fees  facilities expenses  communications expenses and trade show expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense does not include expense amounts associated with stock based compensation of administrative employees or expense amounts associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets 
selling  general and administrative expense for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or as compared with selling  general and administrative expense of million or of net revenue for this increase reflected higher personnel related costs resulting from the addition of certain strategic new hires as well as increased facilities expenses and legal fees  offset in part by cost reductions from our restructuring plan 
as a result of our october restructuring plan  we anticipate a slight decrease in personnel related selling  general and administrative expense in the near term 
notwithstanding the anticipated immediate impact of our restructuring plan  based upon past experience  we anticipate that over the long term selling  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars will continue to increase to support any expansion of our operations through indigenous growth and acquisitions  as a result of periodic changes in our infrastructure to support any increased headcount  acquisition and integration activities  and international operations  and in view of the volume of current litigation 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense generally represents the amortization of deferred compensation as well as expense related to options subject to variable accounting 
deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity and is amortized ratably over the respective vesting periods of the applicable options  generally three to five years 
deferred compensation primarily represents the difference between the fair value of our common stock at the measurement date of each acquisition and the exercise price of the unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition 
additional deferred compensation related to earned contingent consideration is measured and recorded at the date the contingency is met 
we recorded approximately million of net deferred compensation for and million of deferred compensation for  primarily in connection with stock options assumed in our acquisitions 
approximately million and million of deferred compensation was eliminated due to employee terminations during and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense for was million or of net revenue  a decrease of million or as compared with stock based compensation expense of million or of net revenue for the decrease in stock based compensation expense related primarily to the elimination of deferred compensation due to the termination of certain employees and the decrease in our year end stock price  which is used to remeasure stock based compensation for options subject to variable accounting 
approximately million and million of additional stock based compensation expense were classified as cost of revenue for and  respectively 
approximately million and million for and  respectively  of additional stock based compensation expense were classified as restructuring costs resulting from an extension of the exercise period for vested stock options of the employees terminated in connection with our restructuring plans and the acceleration of the vesting period of certain stock options of certain terminated employees as required by their assumed option agreements 
outstanding stock options assumed in certain acquisitions are subject to variable accounting and will be revalued quarterly over their vesting periods until the earlier of i all of the performance goals have been met  ii the time period in which all of the performance goals may be met has lapsed  whether the goals have been satisfied or not  or iii the options are exercised 
if any of the applicable options are forfeited  cancelled or expire  any related previously recorded stock based compensation expense will be reversed 
in addition  if there is a 
table of contents decrease in our stock price at the end of each quarterly reporting period prior to the stock based compensation charge becoming fixed  previously recorded stock based compensation expense will be reversed 
due to the decrease in our stock price during the year ended december   we recorded approximately million in reversals of previously recorded stock based compensation expense related to stock options subject to variable accounting in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 or fin  and fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  or fin during we recorded approximately million in stock based compensation expense  related to stock options subject to variable accounting in accordance with fin and fin these charges and reversals have been and in the future are expected to continue to be based on the amount by which our class a common stock closing price at the end of the reporting period  or at the date of exercise  if earlier  exceeds the exercise price of the stock options 
depending upon movements in the market value of our class a common stock  the variable accounting treatment of certain stock options may result in significant additional stock based compensation expense in future periods 
at december  options to purchase  shares of class a common stock were subject to variable accounting  of which  options were vested and  options were unvested 
these options have a weighted average per share exercise price of and a remaining vesting period of approximately two to three years 
in connection with certain of our acquisitions  if specified future internal performance goals are satisfied  the aggregate consideration for these acquisitions will be increased 
at december  a total of  shares of class a common stock were reserved for future issuance if the remaining internal performance goals established in connection with our acquisitions of serverworks corporation and mobilink are met 
if the remaining internal performance goals had been met at december   additional equity consideration of approximately million  based on the closing price of our class a common stock on december   would have been recorded and allocated between goodwill  stock based compensation and deferred compensation 
the amount of actual additional equity consideration to be recorded will vary depending on which  if any  of the remaining internal performance goals are met and the actual market values of our class a common stock on the dates such internal performance goals are achieved 
amortization of purchased intangible assets 
purchased intangible assets primarily include completed technology and customer relationships  contracts and backlog  and are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the respective assets  ranging from one to three years 
the amortization of purchased intangible assets  excluding completed technology  for was million or of net revenue  a decrease of million or  as compared with million or of net revenue for the decrease resulted primarily from the reclassification  as required by statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  of assembled workforce as goodwill  which is no longer being amortized  offset partially by the amortization of other purchased intangibles 
at december  the unamortized balance of purchased intangible assets that will be amortized to future operating expense was million  all of which is expected to be amortized in in addition  approximately million and million of amortization of completed technology were classified as cost of revenue for and  respectively 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
during the three months ended december   we performed an assessment in accordance with sfas of the carrying value of the goodwill recorded in connection with our various acquisitions 
in accordance with sfas  we compared the carrying value of each reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
we estimated the fair value of our reporting units primarily using the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method  taking into consideration the market approach and certain market multiples as verification of the values derived using the discounted cash flow methodology 
in addition  publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of our company was also considered 
an impairment loss was recognized for reporting units where the carrying value of their goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill 
based on this assessment and an independent valuation  we recorded a charge of billion during to write down the value of goodwill associated with certain of our reporting units 
the primary factors resulting in the impairment charge were the continued significant economic slowdown in the technology sector and the semiconductor industry  affecting both our 
table of contents current operations and expected future revenue  as well as the decline in valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our stock 
in addition  in response to current market conditions  we initiated a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of that included significant headcount reductions  and we decreased our investment in certain target markets that were either performing below our expectations or had low near term growth potential 
as a result  we revised our forecasts of future operating results  which were in turn used in calculating the estimated fair values of the reporting units 
in december we purchased a patent portfolio related to integrated circuit technology for approximately million 
although the patents purchased broaden our technology portfolio  the purchase price was expensed immediately upon acquisition as we did not have plans to currently utilize the patents in our ongoing operations  to generate future cash flow  or for resale to a third party 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  since it is not possible to reasonably forecast cash flows expected to be generated or saved as a result of the acquired patent portfolio  the patent portfolio was determined to be fully impaired at the date of acquisition 
during we performed an assessment of the carrying values of intangible assets recorded in connection with our various acquisitions 
the assessment was performed in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  or sfas  due to the significant economic slowdown and the reduction in near term demand in the technology sector and the semiconductor industry 
as a result of the assessment  we concluded that the decline in market conditions within the industry was significant and other than temporary 
based on this assessment and an independent valuation  we recorded a charge of billion to write down the value of goodwill associated with certain of our purchase transactions 
for further discussion of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring costs 
from the second quarter of through the third quarter of  we implemented a plan the restructuring plan to restructure our operations in response to the challenging economic climate 
as a result of the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry  we announced an additional restructuring program that we began implementing in the fourth quarter of the restructuring plan 
restructuring costs consist of the costs associated with the implementation of these restructuring plans 
these restructuring plans focused on cost reductions and operating efficiencies  including workforce reductions and consolidation of excess facilities  and have resulted in certain business unit realignments 
we recorded restructuring costs totaling million and million for and  respectively  which were classified as operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
we may record additional restructuring costs in as we continue to implement the plan 
approximately and employees were terminated across all of our business functions and geographic regions during and  respectively 
in addition  headcount was reduced through attrition and reductions in the number of temporary and contract workers employed by us 
we recorded workforce reduction charges for and of approximately million and million  respectively  related to severance and fringe benefits 
included in these amounts are approximately million and million for and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense resulting from an extension of the exercise period for vested stock options of certain terminated employees and the acceleration of the vesting period of certain options of certain terminated employees as required by their assumed option agreements 
during and we recorded charges of approximately million and million  respectively  for the consolidation of excess facilities 
these charges related primarily to lease terminations  non cancelable lease costs and write offs of leasehold improvements 

table of contents activity and liability balances related to the and restructuring plans are as follows restructuring plan restructuring plan consolidation consolidation workforce of excess workforce of excess reductions facilities reductions facilities total charged to expense non cash costs cash payments restructuring liabilities at december  charged to expense liabilities assumed in acquisition non cash costs cash payments restructuring liabilities at december  although not related to the or restructuring plans  we assumed additional liabilities of approximately million in connection with the mobilink acquisition for the consolidation of excess facilities  relating primarily to lease terminations  non cancelable lease costs and write offs of leasehold improvements 
the liabilities related to the mobilink acquisition have been classified as restructuring liabilities for presentation in the consolidated balance sheets 
the excess facilities consolidation costs will be paid over the respective lease terms through the goal of our restructuring program is to reduce operating expense by approximately million per quarter from the third quarter level  commencing in the first quarter of we cannot assure that our restructuring programs will achieve all of the expense reductions and other benefits we anticipate 
in addition  anticipated savings from reduced headcount or facility consolidations have been and may in the future be mitigated by subsequent increases to headcount and subsequent facilities additions related to our operating requirements 
litigation settlement costs 
litigation settlement costs of approximately million were incurred in both and amortization of goodwill 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquired company and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
there was no amortization of goodwill recorded in amortization of goodwill for was million or of net revenue 
the significant change in the amortization of goodwill resulted from the impact of adopting new accounting standards 
in june the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  or sfas  and sfas  both effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under these new rules  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas was immediately applicable to any acquisitions made after june  as required by sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill of billion beginning january  included in this amount is million of assembled workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets  which was reclassified as goodwill effective january  as required by sfas in process research and development 
the amounts allocated to ipr d were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed 
there was no ipr d recorded in connection with the acquisition 
ipr d totaled million for the four purchase transactions completed in 
table of contents the fair value of ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present value at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance upon core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development 
future cash flows for each project were estimated based upon forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account product life cycles and market penetration and growth rates 
the ipr d charge includes only the fair value of ipr d performed as of the acquisition date 
the fair value of developed technology is included in identifiable purchased intangible assets  and the fair values of ipr d to be completed and future research and development are included in goodwill 
we believe the amounts recorded as ipr d  as well as developed technology  represent fair values and approximate the amounts an independent party would pay for these projects at the time of the respective acquisitions 
the following table summarizes the significant assumptions at the acquisition dates underlying the valuations for our significant purchase transactions completed in weighted average average estimated risk estimated estimated cost to adjusted percent time to complete discount ipr d purchase transaction development projects complete complete in millions rate in millions visiontech video compression integrated circuits year serverworks high performance systemi o integrated circuits for servers years we completed all of the visiontech development projects as expected in serverworks completed two development projects during approximately million over the previous estimate was required to complete these projects 
serverworks reallocated the resources on the remaining project to focus on next generation semiconductor products that it believes are better aligned with future demand 
except as noted above  actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions 
the assumptions consist primarily of expected completion dates for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections for the products once they have entered the market 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisitions were completed and may potentially result in impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  reflects interest earned on average cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  less interest accrued on our debt and capital lease obligations 
interest income  net  for was million as compared with million for the decrease in resulted primarily from an overall decline in both our cash and investment balances and the interest rates thereon 
other expense  net 
other expense  net  primarily includes recorded gains and losses on strategic investments as well as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and dispositions of property and equipment 
other expense  net  for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million as compared with million or of net revenue for in and we recorded losses of approximately million and million  respectively  representing other than temporary declines in the values of certain of our strategic investments 
the losses for were offset in part by approximately million in gains realized on sales of an investment in a publicly held company 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of approximately million for and a tax benefit of million for  which resulted in effective tax rates of approximately for and for the federal statutory rate was for both periods 
the differences between our effective tax rates for and and the federal statutory rate resulted primarily from the effects of nondeductible ipr d  amortization and impairment of goodwill and other acquisition related expenses from the purchase transactions completed during  and  as well as increases in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december  and we had recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the amounts of approximately million and million  respectively  reflecting an increase in the valuation allowance during of approximately million 
during we concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was appropriate as a result of our recent cumulative losses and the full utilization of our loss carryback potential 
years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue for was million  a decrease of million or as compared with net revenue of billion for net revenue was reduced by million and million for and  respectively  to account for the fair value of the performance based warrants to purchase shares of class a common stock earned by certain customers in connection with purchase and development agreements that we assumed in prior acquisitions 
the decline in net revenue resulted primarily from a decrease in volume shipments of our semiconductor products for the high speed networking market  digital cable set top boxes and cable modems  as our customers faced slower demand for their products and continued to work through their inventory issues  offset in part by shipments of systemi o server products 
due to the significant economic slowdown in the technology sector and semiconductor industry in  we experienced a significant slowdown in customer orders  as well as an increase in the number of order cancellations and reschedulings of backlog 
gross profit 
gross profit for was million or of net revenue  a decrease of million or from gross profit of million or of net revenue for the decrease in gross profit was mainly attributable to the decrease in the volume of semiconductor product shipments as well as non cash acquisition related charges  including amortization of purchased intangible assets and stock based compensation expense 
this decrease was offset in part by cost reductions in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for compared with was primarily a result of the non cash acquisition related charges and  to a lesser extent  decreased absorption of manufacturing overhead due to lower production volumes and shifts in our product mix 
approximately million and million of stock based compensation expense were included in cost of revenue for and  respectively 
approximately million and million of amortization of purchased intangible assets were included in cost of revenue for and  respectively 
research and development expense 
research and development expense for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or as compared with research and development expense of million or of net revenue for this increase was primarily due to the addition of personnel through acquisitions and internal hiring  investment in design tools for the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  and the cost of additional facilities required to support the increase in headcount 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or as compared with selling  general and administrative expense of million or of net revenue for this increase reflected higher personnel related costs resulting from the addition of sales and marketing  senior management and administrative personnel through acquisitions and internal hiring as well as increased facilities expenses and legal fees 
stock based compensation expense 
we recorded approximately million of deferred compensation for and billion of deferred compensation for  primarily in connection with stock options assumed 
table of contents in our acquisitions 
included in the amount is million of deferred compensation recorded during when certain allayer  sibyte and serverworks performance goals were met 
approximately million of this amount was expensed immediately 
approximately million and million of deferred compensation were eliminated due to employee terminations during and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or as compared with stock based compensation expense of million or of net revenue for approximately million and million of additional stock based compensation expense were classified as cost of revenue for and  respectively 
approximately million of additional stock based compensation expense resulting from an extension of the exercise period for vested stock options of certain terminated employees was classified as restructuring costs for approximately million of additional stock based compensation expense was classified as merger related costs for the significant increase in stock based compensation expense for related primarily to stock options assumed in the four purchase transactions completed during as well as the full year impact of the eight purchase transactions completed during  all of which were accounted for in accordance with fin approximately million of the stock based compensation expense recorded for related to stock options subject to variable accounting 
this expense was calculated based on the amount by which our class a common stock closing price at the end of the reporting period  or at the date of exercise  if earlier  exceeded the exercise price of the stock options 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
in connection with the four purchase transactions completed during and contingent consideration earned from previous acquisitions  we recorded approximately million of additional goodwill and million of purchased intangible assets for for the eight purchase transactions completed during  we recorded approximately billion of goodwill and million of purchased intangible assets for the amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets for was million or of net revenue  an increase of million or as compared with million or of net revenue for in addition  approximately million and million of amortization of purchased intangible assets was classified as cost of revenue for and  respectively 
in connection with our acquisitions of allayer  sibyte and serverworks  we recorded million of additional goodwill during when certain internal performance goals were met 
impairment of goodwill 
during we performed an assessment of the carrying values of intangible assets recorded in connection with our various acquisitions 
the assessment was performed in accordance with sfas  due to the significant economic slowdown and the reduction in near term demand in the technology sector and the semiconductor industry 
as a result of the assessment  we concluded that the decline in market conditions within the industry was significant and other than temporary 
based on this assessment and an independent valuation  we recorded a charge of billion to write down the value of goodwill associated with certain of our purchase transactions 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in process research and development 
ipr d totaled million for the four purchase transactions completed in  as compared with million for the eight purchase transactions completed in the amounts allocated to ipr d were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed

we completed three development projects of altima as expected during we reallocated the resources on the remaining project to focus on next generation semiconductor products that we believed were better aligned with future demand 
we completed all eight of the newport development projects as expected during an additional million over the previous estimate was required to complete these projects 
we completed the silicon spice development project as expected in we completed one of the element development projects during we reallocated the resources on the remaining project to focus on next generation semiconductor products that we believed were better aligned with future demand 
we completed one of the allayer projects as expected during we reallocated the resources on the two remaining projects to focus on next generation semiconductor products that we believed were better aligned with future demand 
we completed one of the sibyte development projects during one additional project  which is currently approximately complete  is expected to be completed during  and we estimate the cost to complete this project will be approximately million 
except as noted above  actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions 
restructuring costs 
in the second quarter of we announced and began implementing a plan to restructure our operations in response to the then current challenging economic climate 
this restructuring plan resulted in certain business unit realignments  workforce reductions and consolidation of excess facilities 
for we recorded restructuring costs totaling million  which were classified as operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
through december  the restructuring plan had resulted in termination of the employment of approximately employees across all business functions and geographic regions 
we recorded workforce 
table of contents reduction charges of approximately million related to severance and fringe benefits 
included in this amount is approximately million of stock based compensation expense resulting from an extension of the exercise period for vested stock options of the terminated employees 
in addition  headcount was reduced through attrition and reductions in the number of temporary and contract workers employed by us 
through december  we recorded charges of approximately million for the consolidation of excess facilities 
the charges related primarily to lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs 
litigation settlement costs 
litigation settlement costs of approximately million were incurred for no comparable litigation settlement costs were incurred for merger related costs 
in connection with the pooling of interests transactions in  merger related costs of approximately million were incurred 
no merger related costs were incurred for as there were no business combinations accounted for as poolings of interests 
merger related costs consist primarily of transaction costs  such as fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other related fees and expenses  incurred in acquisitions as well as certain restructuring costs related to the disposition of duplicative facilities and assets and the write down of unutilized assets 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  for was million as compared with million for the decrease for was the result of interest expense incurred on debt assumed from our serverworks acquisition and an overall decline in interest rates on our investments  partially offset by increased cash balances available to invest resulting from the cash generated by operations  cash balances assumed in acquisitions  and cash received from the exercise of employee stock options 
other expense  net 
other expense  net  primarily includes recorded gains and losses on strategic investments as well as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and dispositions of property and equipment 
for  other expense  net  was million as compared with million for during we recorded a loss of approximately million representing an other than temporary decline in the value of our strategic investments 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded income tax benefits of approximately million for and million for  which resulted in effective tax rates of approximately for and for the federal statutory rate was for both periods 
the differences between our effective tax rates for and and the federal statutory rate resulted primarily from the effects of nondeductible ipr d  impairment of goodwill and other acquisition related expenses from the twelve purchase transactions completed during and  as well as the effects of certain losses recorded without tax benefit 
at december  and we provided valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the amounts of approximately million and million  respectively  resulting in an increase in the valuation allowance in of approximately million 
there was no valuation allowance provided against the remainder of our deferred tax assets  as we believed that it was more likely than not that these assets would be realized 
the primary bases for this conclusion were the expectation of future income from our ordinary and recurring operations and tax planning strategies  which relied on our continuing ability to realize value from our intellectual property portfolio 
impact of adoption of accounting standard in june the fasb issued sfas under these new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
as required by sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill of billion beginning january   which includes million of assembled workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets  which was reclassified to goodwill effective january  as required by sfas 
table of contents the following table presents the impact of sfas on net loss and net loss per share had the standard been in effect for the years ended december  and years ended december  in thousands  except per share data net loss as reported adjustments amortization of goodwill amortization of assembled workforce previously classified as a purchased intangible asset income tax effect net adjustments net loss as adjusted net loss per share basic and diluted as reported net loss per share basic and diluted as adjusted recent accounting pronouncements in june the fasb issued sfas no

we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

table of contents liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash and marketable securities on hand 
since our inception we have financed our operations through a combination of sales of equity securities  cash generated by operations and cash assumed in acquisitions 
including restricted marketable securities  at december  we had million in working capital  million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and million in long term marketable securities 
marketable securities are defined as income yielding securities that can be readily converted into cash 
certain marketable securities are pledged as collateral against our bank credit facility and consequently are classified as restricted securities 
at december  we had million in working capital  million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and million in long term marketable securities 
our working capital decreased in primarily due to our operating loss  additions to property and equipment  liabilities recorded in connection with our restructuring activities  and the assumption of net liabilities in the mobilink acquisition 
cash provided and used in and cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at december  to million at december  as the cash provided by investing and financing activities was more than offset by cash used in operations 
during our operating activities used million in cash 
this was a result of our net loss of billion  which was offset in part by billion in non cash items and million in cash provided by changes in net operating assets and liabilities 
non cash items included in net loss include impairment of goodwill  depreciation  stock based compensation expense  amortization of purchased intangible assets  certain restructuring charges  valuation allowance on deferred taxes  and net losses on strategic investments 
during operating activities provided million in cash 
although we had a net loss of billion for  such amount included non cash items aggregating billion resulting from depreciation  stock based compensation expense  amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets  impairment of goodwill  ipr d  certain restructuring charges  valuation allowance on deferred taxes  and losses on strategic investments 
in addition to the impact of non cash items  our operating activities also reflected decreases in accounts receivable and inventory  offset in part by decreases in other accrued liabilities 
accounts receivable increased million to million during the increase in accounts receivable resulted primarily from the increase in net revenue in the fourth quarter of as compared with the fourth quarter of and due to the fact that our sales were fairly consistent throughout the quarter  as opposed to the fourth quarter of in which a higher proportion of sales occurred in the first two months of that quarter 
inventories increased million to million during the increase in inventory was to support our increased revenue levels and entry into certain markets that require higher inventory levels 
investing activities provided cash in the amount of million in  primarily as a result of million in net proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities and strategic investments  offset in part by the purchase of million of capital equipment to support our operations and the purchase of million of strategic investments 
our investing activities used cash in the amount of million in  primarily as a result of million of net purchases of marketable securities  the purchase of million of capital equipment to support our operations and the purchase of million of strategic investments  offset in part by million of net cash acquired in purchase transactions 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  which was primarily the result of million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by million in payments on debt and capital lease obligations 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  which was primarily the result of a million bank credit facility secured to replace the serverworks credit facility that was repaid in  million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and under our employee stock purchase plan  and million in net proceeds from the exercise of performance 
table of contents based warrants earned by customers  partially offset by million in payments on debt obligations primarily of acquired companies 
due to the continued decline in our stock price  we received fewer proceeds from the exercise of stock options in than we did in  as only options with lower exercise prices were exercised 
in the future we may not generate as much cash from the exercise of stock options as we have in the past 
obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of december  payment obligations by year in thousands there after total bank credit facility payable to customer capital leases and other obligations deferred payments on fixed asset purchases operating leases restructuring liabilities purchase commitments total we entered into a million financing arrangement for a bank credit facility in december to replace a million credit facility that matured in december we may periodically choose the rate at which the new credit facility bears interest at either a the higher of i plus the federal reserve rate and ii the bank of america prime rate or b libor plus selected in one  two or three month periods 
interest is payable at either the selected interest period or quarterly 
at december   million was outstanding under the credit facility and the interest rate was 
a minimum of million in marketable securities is required to secure the credit facility  and the carrying value of these restricted marketable securities at december  was million 
the credit facility is due and payable december  and may be paid earlier without premium or penalty 
at december  our debt also included a stipulated judgment payable to a customer with a remaining balance of million to be paid in four installments  with the final installment due in november  plus interest on the unpaid principal balance remaining from time to time outstanding at a rate of approximately per annum 
see legal proceedings  included in part i  item of this report and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
capitalized leases and other obligations are payable in varying monthly installments at a weighted average rate of per annum 
we received extended payment terms in connection with the million purchase of certain engineering design tools 
we lease our facilities and certain engineering design tools and information systems equipment under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through our restructuring liabilities consist primarily of estimated future lease and operating costs on restructured facilities  less offsetting sublease income if any 
these costs will be paid over the respective lease terms through we had outstanding capital commitments totaling approximately million as of december   primarily for the purchase of lab test equipment and computer hardware and for information systems infrastructure 
during we spent approximately million on capital equipment to support our operations 
we expect that we will continue to purchase additional engineering design tools  computer hardware  test equipment  information systems and leasehold improvements to support our operations 
we may finance 
table of contents these purchases through the cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that we have on hand  leases  borrowings  debt or equity offerings  or a combination of any of these means 
prospective capital needs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements and commitments for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on a timely basis on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
we anticipate that the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans  and product and technology roadmaps  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  volume price discounts  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors responses to our products  our relationships with suppliers and customers  litigation expenses and judgments  expenses related to our restructuring plans  the effectiveness of our expense and product cost control and reduction efforts  and general economic conditions and specific conditions in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  including the effects of the current international conflict and the general economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned future growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 

table of contents risk factors before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our subsequent reports on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occur with material adverse effects on broadcom  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our class a common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the continuing worldwide economic slowdown  acts of war  terrorism  international conflicts and related uncertainties may adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
slower economic activity  concerns about inflation  decreased consumer confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns in the telecommunications and related industries  the war in iraq and recent international conflicts  terrorist and military activity have resulted in a continuing downturn in worldwide economic conditions 
as a result of these unfavorable economic conditions  beginning in the first half of we experienced a significant slowdown in customer orders  an increase in the number of cancellations and reschedulings of backlog  and higher overhead costs as a percentage of our reduced net revenue  from which we have not yet fully recovered 
we cannot predict the timing  strength and duration of any economic recovery in the semiconductor industry and in particular  the broadband communications markets 
in addition  the events of september  and the continuing international conflicts and terrorist acts and the possibility of an extended war in iraq can be expected to place further pressure on economic conditions in the united states and worldwide 
these conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
if such conditions continue or worsen  our business  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
any such variations could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
we operate primarily in the semiconductor industry  which is cyclical and subject to rapid change and evolving industry standards 
from time to time  the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns such as the current one 
these downturns are characterized by diminished product demand  excess customer inventories  accelerated erosion of prices and excess production capacity 
these factors could cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and in our results of operations 
the current downturn and future downturns in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged  and any failure of this industry or the broadband communications markets to fully recover from the current downturn could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints  which may affect our ability to ship products in future periods 
our quarterly results may vary significantly as a result of the general conditions in the semiconductor industry  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly 
as a result  we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly net revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those listed below and those identified throughout this risk factors section economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and in particular  the broadband communications markets  including the effects of the current significant economic slowdown  
table of contents international conflicts and acts of terrorism  the possibility of an extended war in iraq or elsewhere and the impact of adverse economic  market and political conditions worldwide  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and the ability of our customers to manage their inventories  the gain or loss of a key customer  design win or order  changes in our product or customer mix  the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products  the effectiveness of our expense and product cost control and reduction efforts  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our technologies and products in our target markets  our ability to retain  recruit and hire key executives  technical personnel and other employees in the positions and numbers  with the experience and capabilities and at the compensation levels that we need to implement our business and product plans  fluctuations in the manufacturing yields of our third party semiconductor foundries and other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of our products  and our ability to reduce costs and increase efficiencies through the ongoing restructuring plan that we implemented in the fourth quarter of additionally  we are beginning to derive a larger portion of our product revenue from emerging markets such as wireless networking  cellular  dsl  pvr and dbs 
these markets are immature and unpredictable and we cannot assure you that these markets will develop or that we will continue to derive significant revenue from these markets in the future 
due to the limited amount of historical data available to us  it is difficult to predict our future revenue streams and the sustainability of such emerging markets 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance 
we may be unable to attract  retain and motivate key senior management and technical personnel  which could seriously harm our business 
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key senior management personnel  including our co founder and chief technical officer dr 
henry samueli  our president and chief executive officer  alan e 
ross  and other senior executives 
we do not have employment agreements with these executives  or any other key employees  that govern the length of their service 
the loss of the services of dr 
samueli  mr 
ross and certain other key senior management or technical personnel could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in january one of our co founders  dr 
henry t 
nicholas  iii  resigned from his positions as president and chief executive officer and stated that he will not stand for re election to the board at our annual meeting 
mr 
ross  who was serving as our chief operating officer at the time of dr 
nicholas resignation  has assumed the responsibilities of president and chief executive officer 
we are conducting a search for a successor chief executive officer 
if we are unable to attract a suitable successor to mr 
ross or if we lose the services of mr 
ross prior to hiring his successor  our business could be seriously harmed 
we anticipate that the recruitment of a successor chief executive officer and the adjustment to any changes implemented by such chief executive officer  will continue to require substantial attention and effort and place a significant burden on our board of directors and management personnel 

table of contents furthermore  our future success depends on the ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate senior management and qualified technical personnel  particularly senior managers  digital circuit designers  rf and mixed signal circuit designers  software engineers and systems applications engineers 
competition for these employees is intense  and it may be more difficult to attract personnel prior to hiring a successor to mr 
ross 
stock options generally comprise a significant portion of our compensation packages for all employees  and the substantial decline in the price of our class a common stock over the past two years may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain key employees 
our inability to attract and retain additional key employees could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  six of the officers who serve as general managers of our business units have been in such positions for a year or less 
these individuals are not long time broadcom employees  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them or that they will successfully implement our business plans within these business units 
our acquisition strategy may be dilutive to existing shareholders  result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations  and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses 
a key element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses  products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
between january  and december  we acquired companies 
we continually evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise  including business combination transactions  strategic partnerships  capital infusions  and the purchase or sale of assets 
we also continually evaluate the performance and prospects of our various businesses and possible adjustments in our businesses to reflect changes in our assessment of their performance and prospects 
acquisitions may require significant capital infusions  typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies 
we have in the past and may in the future experience delays in the timing and successful integration of an acquired company s technologies and product development through volume production  unanticipated costs and expenditures  changing relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  or contractual  intellectual property or employment issues 
in addition  key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for us 
the acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also require us to enter into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience 
these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
these challenges are magnified as the size of the acquisition increases 
furthermore  these challenges would be even greater if we acquired a business or entered into a business combination transaction with a company that was larger and more difficult to integrate than the typical size of the companies we have historically acquired 
furthermore  acquisitions may require large one time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges  or the amortization of amounts related to deferred compensation and certain purchased intangible assets  any of which could negatively impact our results of operations 
in connection with our purchase transactions to date  we recorded goodwill in the aggregate amount of approximately billion 
through the portion of that goodwill attributable to each acquisition generally was amortized over a month period from the date that the acquisition closed 
in accordance with sfas  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of billion during the three months ended september  to write down the value of goodwill associated with certain of our purchase transactions 
effective january  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas and sfas in accordance with sfas we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of billion during the three months ended december  to write down the value of goodwill associated with certain of our purchase transactions 
we may incur additional goodwill impairment charges in the future 
in addition  in connection with these acquisitions we incurred deferred compensation charges generally related to the assumption of stock options and restricted shares in the aggregate 
table of contents amount of approximately billion  which is being amortized over the period of time for which the relevant options or restricted stock may continue to vest 
we expect to record additional goodwill and deferred compensation in connection with future acquisitions and may record additional goodwill and deferred compensation with respect to prior acquisitions that involve as yet unearned contingent consideration 
any of these events could cause the price of our class a common stock to decline 
acquisitions made entirely or partially for cash may reduce our cash reserves 
alternatively  if we issue equity in connection with an acquisition  as in the case of our recent acquisitions  or convertible debt securities  the issuance may be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we may issue could have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our class a or class b common stock 
for example  as a consequence of the prior pooling of interests rules  the securities issued in nine of our prior acquisitions were shares of class b common stock  which have voting rights superior to our publicly traded class a common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any pending or future acquisitions or that we will realize the benefits anticipated from these acquisitions 
in the future  we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations  if at all 
even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities  we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms  as the recent decline in the price of our class a common stock may make it significantly more difficult and expensive to initiate or consummate additional acquisitions 
moreover  it may be difficult for us to successfully integrate any acquired businesses  products  technologies or personnel  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenue  the loss of a key customer could seriously impact our revenue and harm our business 
in addition  if we are unable to continue to sell existing and new products to our key customers in significant quantities or to attract new significant customers  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
we have derived a substantial portion of our revenue in the past from sales to a relatively small number of customers 
as a result  the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
sales to hewlett packard including sales to compaq  which was acquired by hewlett packard in may  motorola and dell  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our net revenue in sales to our five largest customers  including sales to their respective manufacturing subcontractors  represented approximately of our net revenue in as compared with of our net revenue in we expect that a small group of key customers  the composition of which has varied over time  will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue in and in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our future operating results will continue to depend on the success of our largest customers and on our ability to sell existing and new products to these customers in significant quantities 
we may not be able to maintain or increase sales to certain of our key customers for a variety of reasons  including the following most of our customers can stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty  our agreements with our customers typically do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products  many of our customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors that may affect their decisions to purchase our products  our customers face intense competition from other manufacturers that do not use our products  and some of our customers offer or may offer products that compete with our products 
in addition  our longstanding relationships with some of our larger customers may also deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products 
to attract new customers or retain existing customers  we may offer certain customers favorable prices on our products 
if these prices are lower than 
table of contents the prices paid by our existing customers  we would have to offer the same lower prices to certain of our customers who have contractual most favored nation pricing arrangements 
in that event  our average selling prices and gross margins would decline 
the loss of a key customer  a reduction in sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties  and any significant order cancellations or deferrals could adversely affect our business 
we typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders that customers can generally cancel or defer on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
any significant cancellations or deferrals in the future could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  cancellations or deferrals of product orders  the return of previously sold products or the overproduction of products due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could cause us to hold excess or obsolete inventory  which could reduce our profit margins  increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
furthermore  we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not timely pay for these products  we could incur significant charges against our income 
we face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  which could reduce our market share in existing markets and affect our entry into new markets 
the semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets are intensely competitive 
we expect competition to continue to increase as industry standards become well known and as other competitors enter our target markets 
we currently compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of integrated circuits and related applications in the markets for digital cable and satellite set top boxes  cable and dsl modems and residential gateways  high speed transmission and switching for local  metropolitan  wide area and storage networking  home and wireless networking  cellular and terrestrial wireless communications  voip gateway and telephony systems  broadband network processors  and systemi o server solutions 
we also compete with suppliers of system level and motherboard level solutions incorporating integrated circuits that are proprietary or sourced from manufacturers other than broadcom 
this competition has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling prices for some of our products 
in all of our target markets  we also may face competition from newly established competitors  suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies  and customers who choose to develop their own silicon solutions 
we also expect to encounter further consolidation in the markets in which we compete 
many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
existing or new competitors may also develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features and functionality  lower power requirements  greater levels of integration or lower cost 
increased competition has in the past and is likely to continue to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share in certain markets 
in some of our businesses  we are dependent on competitors for information for the timely development of next generation products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards in the semiconductor industry and broadband communications markets to remain competitive 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards and our customers changing demands 
we sell products in markets which are characterized by rapidly 
table of contents changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and increasing demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometries 
our past sales and profitability have resulted  to a large extent  from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products incorporating the new standards 
our ability to adapt to these changes and to anticipate future standards  and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards  will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth 
if new industry standards emerge  our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete  and we could lose market share 
we may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards 
in addition  our target markets continue to undergo rapid growth and consolidation 
a significant slowdown in any of these or other broadband communications markets could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success will also depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products for the broadband communications markets and to introduce and promote those products successfully 
the broadband communications markets may not continue to develop to the extent or in the time periods that we anticipate 
we have in the past invested substantial resources in emerging technologies that did not achieve the market acceptance that we had expected 
if new markets do not develop as we anticipate  or if our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner or to achieve market acceptance of our new products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our future success is dependent upon our ability to develop new silicon solutions for existing and new markets  introduce these products in a cost effective and timely manner and convince leading equipment manufacturers to select these products for design into their own new products 
our historical quarterly results have been  and we expect that our future results will continue to be  dependent on the introduction of a relatively small number of new products and the timely completion and delivery of those products to customers 
the development of new silicon devices is highly complex  and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and lower than anticipated manufacturing yields in the early production of such products 
our ability to develop and deliver new products successfully will depend on various factors  including our ability to accurately predict market requirements and evolving industry standards  accurately define new products  timely complete and introduce new product designs  timely qualify and obtain industry interoperability certification of our products and the products of our customers into which our products will be incorporated  obtain sufficient foundry capacity  achieve high manufacturing yields  shift our products to smaller geometry process technologies to achieve lower cost and higher levels of design integration  and gain market acceptance of our products and our customers products 
in some of our businesses  our ability to develop and deliver next generation products successfully depends in part on access to information from companies that are competitors 
if we are not able to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner  we will be unable to attract new customers or retain our existing customers as these customers may transition to other companies that can meet their product development needs and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents we will have difficulty selling our products if customers do not design our products into their product offerings or if our customers product offerings are not commercially successful 
our products are generally incorporated into our customers products at the design stage 
as a result  we rely on equipment manufacturers to select our products to be designed into their products 
without these design wins  it becomes difficult to sell our products 
we often incur significant expenditures on the development of a new product without any assurance that an equipment manufacturer will select our product for design into its own product 
additionally  in some instances  we are dependent on third parties to obtain or provide information that we need to achieve a design win 
some of these third parties may be competitors or may be involved in litigation with us 
once an equipment manufacturer designs a competitor s product into its product offering  it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products to that customer because changing suppliers involves significant cost  time  effort and risk for the customer 
furthermore  even if an equipment manufacturer designs one of our products into its product offering  we cannot be assured that its product will be successful or that we will receive any revenue from such product 
sales of our products largely depend on the commercial success of our customers products 
our customers are typically not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to stop using our products if their own products are not commercially successful or for any other reason 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins or that our customers equipment that incorporates our products will ever be commercially successful 
our products typically have lengthy sales cycles 
a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans  which could cause us to lose anticipated sales 
in addition  our average product life cycles tend to be short and  as a result  we may hold excess or obsolete inventory that could adversely affect our operating results 
after we have developed and delivered a product to a customer  the customer will usually test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product 
our customers may need three to six months or longer to test  evaluate and adopt our product and an additional three to nine months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our product 
moreover  in light of the prolonged economic slowdown in the semiconductor industry  it may take significantly longer than three to nine months before customers commence volume production of equipment incorporating some of our products 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenue from these products 
it is possible that we may never generate any revenue from these products after incurring such expenditures 
even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment  we have no assurances that the customer will ultimately market and sell its equipment or that such efforts by our customer will be successful 
the delays inherent in our lengthy sales cycle increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans 
such a cancellation or change in plans by a customer could cause us to lose sales that we had anticipated 
in addition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if a significant customer curtails  reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release equipment that contains our products 
while our sales cycles are typically long  our average product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate 
as a result  the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not generate material revenue for us  and from time to time  we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory 
if we incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory in the future that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to compensate for those expenses  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory  our operating results would be harmed 
our future success depends in significant part on strategic relationships with certain customers 
if we cannot maintain these relationships or if these customers develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solutions instead of buying our products  our operating results would be adversely affected 
in the past  we have relied in significant part on our strategic relationships with customers that are technology leaders in our target markets 
we intend to pursue and continue to form these strategic relationships but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
these relationships often require us to develop new products that may involve significant technological challenges 
our partners frequently place considerable pressure 
table of contents on us to meet their tight development schedules 
accordingly  we may have to devote a substantial amount of our limited resources to our strategic relationships  which could detract from or delay our completion of other important development projects 
delays in development could impair our relationships with our strategic partners and negatively impact sales of the products under development 
moreover  it is possible that our customers may develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solution for products that they currently buy from us 
if that happens  our sales would decline and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses and in undetected defects or bugs  which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products and damage our reputation with current or prospective customers 
highly complex products such as the products that we offer frequently contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects and bugs 
if any of our products contains defects or bugs  or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers 
to alleviate these problems  we may have to invest significant capital and other resources 
although our products are tested by our suppliers  our customers and ourselves  it is possible that our new products will contain defects or bugs 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts 
moreover  we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
we depend on five independent foundry subcontractors to manufacture substantially all of our current products  and any failure to secure and maintain sufficient foundry capacity could materially and adversely affect our business 
we do not own or operate a fabrication facility 
five outside foundry subcontractors located in asia manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices in current production 
in september two of the foundries principal facilities were affected by a significant earthquake in taiwan 
as a consequence of this earthquake  they suffered power outages and equipment damage that impaired their wafer deliveries which  together with strong demand  resulted in wafer shortages and higher wafer pricing industrywide 
if any of our foundries suffers any damage to its facilities  experiences power outages  encounters financial difficulties or any other disruption of foundry capacity  we would need to qualify an alternative foundry in a timely manner 
even our current foundries need to have new manufacturing processes requalified if there is a disruption in an existing process 
we typically require several months to qualify a new foundry or process before we can begin shipping products from it 
if we cannot accomplish this qualification in a timely manner  we may still experience a significant interruption in supply of the affected products 
because we rely on outside foundries with limited capacity  we face several significant risks  including a lack of ensured wafer supply and potential wafer shortages and higher wafer prices  limited control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and control  manufacturing yields and production costs  and the unavailability of or potential delays in obtaining access to key process technologies 
in addition  the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process 
although we work closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields  our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields 
this often occurs during the production of new products or the installation and start up of new process technologies 

table of contents the ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by its available capacity and existing obligations 
although we have entered into contractual commitments to supply specified levels of products to some of our customers  we do not have a long term volume purchase agreement or a guaranteed level of production capacity with any of our foundries 
foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices 
availability of foundry capacity has in the recent past been reduced from time to time due to strong demand 
we place our orders on the basis of our customers purchase orders  and the foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice 
it is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are  or that have long term agreements with our main foundries  may induce our foundries to reallocate capacity to them 
this reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need 
although we primarily use five independent foundries  most of our components are not manufactured at more than one foundry at any given time  and our products typically are designed to be manufactured on a specific process at only one of these foundries 
accordingly  if one of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed  we could experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those components 
we cannot assure you that any of our existing or new foundries will be able to produce integrated circuits with acceptable manufacturing yields  or that our foundries will be able to deliver enough semiconductor devices to us on a timely basis  or at reasonable prices  which could impair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
some of our acquired companies have established relationships with foundries other than our five main foundries  and we are currently using these other foundries to produce the initial products of these acquired companies 
we may utilize such foundries for other products in the future 
in using new foundries  we will be subject to all of the same risks described in the foregoing paragraphs with respect to our current foundries 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration  which may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
in order to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs  and we have designed most of our products to be manufactured in 
micron  
micron  
micron and 
micron geometry processes 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes  which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry relationships 
if our foundries or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  or at all 
third party claims of infringement or other claims against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products  require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties  and seriously harm our operating results 
companies in the semiconductor and broadband communities industries often aggressively protect and pursue their intellectual property rights 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive in the future  notices that claim we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused other parties proprietary rights 
moreover  in the past we have been engaged  and currently we are engaged in litigation with parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets 
although we are defending 
table of contents the pending litigation vigorously  it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits 
in addition  we may be sued by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets  or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents 
an adverse determination in any of these types of claims could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products  could increase our costs of production and could expose us to significant liability 
any of these claims may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in a patent or trade secret action  a court could issue a preliminary or permanent injunction that would require us to withdraw or recall certain products from the market or redesign certain products offered for sale or under development 
in addition  we may be liable for damages for past infringement and royalties for future use of the technology and we may be liable for treble damages if infringement is found to have been willful 
we may also have to indemnify some customers and strategic partners under our agreements with such parties if a third party alleges or if a court finds that we have infringed upon  misappropriated or misused another party s proprietary rights 
even if claims against us are not valid or successfully asserted  these claims could result in significant costs and a diversion of management and personnel resources to defend 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
however  we may not be able to obtain such a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
as our international business expands  our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected as a result of legal  business  political and economic risks specific to our international operations 
we currently obtain substantially all of our manufacturing  assembly and testing services from suppliers located outside the united states 
in addition  approximately of our net revenue for the fiscal year was derived from sales to independent customers outside the united states 
we also frequently ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
in we established an international distribution center that includes an engineering design center in singapore 
we also undertake design and development activities in canada  belgium  the united kingdom  the netherlands  india  israel  taiwan and china 
we intend to continue to expand our international business activities and to open other design and operational centers abroad 
the war in iraq  recent terrorist attacks in the united states and abroad  the resulting heightened security and the increasing risk of extended international military conflicts may adversely impact our international sales and could make our international operations more expensive 
international operations are subject to many inherent risks  including but not limited to acts of war  terrorism and international conflicts  political  social and economic instability  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  nationalization of business and blocking of cash flows  trade restrictions  the imposition of governmental controls and restrictions  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  foreign technical standards  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  
table of contents difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
we cannot assure you that the factors described above will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our foreign sales 
we currently operate under tax holidays in certain foreign jurisdictions 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to enjoy such tax holidays or realize any net tax benefits from such tax holidays 
moreover  the seasonality of international sales and economic conditions in our primary overseas markets may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad 
all of our international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies 
we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activities 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  which could harm our competitive position 
our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we primarily rely on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies and processes  it is possible that competitors or other parties may obtain  use or disclose our technologies and processes 
we have received us patents and have filed over  additional us patent applications 
we cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued 
even if a new patent is issued  the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any of our existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
as such  any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection 
if our patents do not adequately protect our technology  our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours 
we may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patents and applications 
even if foreign patents are granted  effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available 
our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
moreover  because we have participated in developing various industry standards  we may be required to license some of our patents to others  including competitors  who develop products based on the adopted standards 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners 
we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products  services or technology without our authorization 
as a result  our technologies and processes may be misappropriated  particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  some of our customers have entered into agreements with us that grant them the right to use our proprietary technology if we ever fail to fulfill our obligations  including product supply obligations  under those agreements  and if we do not correct the failure within a specified time period 
moreover  we often incorporate the intellectual property of strategic customers into our own designs  and have certain obligations not to use or disclose their intellectual property without their authorization 
we cannot assure you that our efforts to prevent the misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers will succeed 
we are currently engaged in litigation  and we may have to engage in additional litigation in the future  to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
this litigation has in the past been and will likely continue to be very expensive and time consuming 
additionally  any litigation can divert management s attention from the operation of the business  which could negatively impact our operations 

table of contents the loss of any of the third party subcontractors that assemble and test substantially all of our current products could disrupt our shipments  harm our customer relationships and adversely affect our net sales 
we do not own or operate an assembly or test facility 
six third party subcontractors located in asia assemble and test substantially all of our current products 
because we rely on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules and quality assurance and control 
this lack of control has in the past resulted  and could in the future result  in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase our manufacturing  assembly or testing costs 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these subcontractors and typically procure services from these suppliers on a per order basis 
if any of these subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties  suffers any damage to its facilities  experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity  we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner 
due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assemblers and testers  we could experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assemblers or testers for our components 
any problems that we may encounter with the delivery  quality or cost of our products could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are continuing to develop relationships with additional third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products 
even if we use these new subcontractors  we will continue to be subject to all of the same risks described in the foregoing paragraph 
our recently implemented restructuring plan could result in management distractions  operational disruptions and other difficulties and could impair our ability to respond rapidly to growth opportunities 
as a result of the continuing significant economic slowdown and the related uncertainties in the semiconductor industry  we implemented a new restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of the plan focuses on cost reductions and operating efficiencies  and included workforce reductions 
employees directly affected by the reductions may seek future employment with our business partners  customers or competitors 
although all employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement with us at the time of hire  we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
furthermore  our restructuring efforts could divert the attention of our management away from our operations  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
we cannot assure you that our restructuring efforts will be successful  that future operations will improve or that the completion of the restructuring will not disrupt our operations 
a large portion of our operating expenses  including rent  salaries and capital lease expenditures  are fixed and difficult to reduce or change 
accordingly  if our revenue does not meet our expectations  we may not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in revenue and additional restructuring of our operations may be required in the future 
if we continue to reduce our workforce  it may adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to any renewed growth opportunities 
we may seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or by borrowing money  but additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements and commitments for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we believe we could raise these funds by selling more equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
however  we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or potential markets 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our class a or class b common stock 

table of contents our california facilities and the facilities of three of the five primary independent foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our current products are located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our california facilities  including our principal executive offices  are located near major earthquake fault lines 
if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of our facilities is located  it could significantly disrupt our operations 
in addition  two of the five outside foundries upon which we rely to manufacture substantially all of our semiconductor devices  are located in taiwan and one such outside foundry is located in japan 
both taiwan and japan have experienced significant earthquakes in the past and could be subject to additional earthquakes 
any earthquake or other natural disaster in taiwan or japan could materially disrupt our foundries production capabilities and could result in our experiencing a significant delay in delivery  or substantial shortage  of wafers and possibly in higher wafer prices 
changes in current or future laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations by the fcc  other federal or state agencies or foreign governments could impede the sale of our products or otherwise harm our business 
the federal communications commission has broad jurisdiction over each of our target markets 
although current fcc regulations and the laws and regulations of other federal or state agencies are not directly applicable to our products  they do apply to much of the equipment into which our products are incorporated 
as a result  the effects of regulation on our customers or the industries in which they operate may  in turn  materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fcc regulatory policies that affect the ability of cable operators or telephone companies to offer certain services or other aspects of their business may impede the sale of our products 
for example  in the past we have experienced delays when products incorporating our chips failed to comply with fcc emissions specifications 
we and our customers may also be subject to regulation by countries other than the united states 
foreign governments may impose tariffs  duties and other import restrictions on components that we obtain from non domestic suppliers and may impose export restrictions on products that we sell internationally 
these tariffs  duties or restrictions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states or elsewhere could also materially and adversely affect our business 
our stock price is highly volatile 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our class a common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
since august  our class a common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
these fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of changes in our senior management  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in semiconductor industry and the broadband communications markets  international conflicts  including the possibility of an extended war in iraq and elsewhere  and acts of terrorism  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  changes in investor perceptions  changes in accounting rules  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 

table of contents in addition  the market prices of securities of internet related  semiconductor and other high technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subject of securities class action litigation  and as noted in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item  we have recently been sued in several purported securities class action lawsuits  which have been consolidated into a single action 
we and our directors and officers have also been sued in purported shareholder derivative actions and other securities litigation 
although we believe that those lawsuits are without merit  an adverse determination could have a very significant effect on our business and results of operations  and could materially affect the price of our stock 
moreover  regardless of the ultimate result  it is likely that the lawsuits will divert management s attention and resources from other matters  which could also adversely affect the price of our stock 
various export licensing requirements could materially and adversely affect our business or require us to significantly modify our current business practices 
various government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products 
we have applied for and received a number of export licenses and have made a number of other required filings under these export regulations 
however  in connection with the implementation of our comprehensive export compliance program  we discovered that we had inadvertently failed to file certain export applications and notices 
we recently made the required filings and certain related disclosures to the appropriate government regulators 
we have obtained permission to continue exporting the affected products  however  we may be subject to fines or other penalties because some of the filings were not made in a timely manner 
some of our directors  executive officers and their affiliates can control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders  and accordingly we will not be able to engage in certain transactions without their approval 
as of december  our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock and of the total voting power held by our shareholders 
in particular  as of december  our two founders  dr 
henry t 
nicholas  iii and dr 
henry samueli  beneficially owned a total of approximately of our outstanding common stock and of the total voting power held by our shareholders 
accordingly  these shareholders currently have enough voting power to control the outcome of matters that require the approval of our shareholders 
these matters include the election of our board of directors  the issuance of additional shares of class b common stock and the approval of most significant corporate transactions  including a merger  consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets 
as of march  dr 
nicholas and dr 
samueli also hold two of the six seats on our board of directors and serve as co chairmen of the board  although dr 
nicholas has stated he will not stand for re election to the board at our annual meeting 
in addition to serving as a director  dr 
samueli serves as our chief technical officer 
because of their significant voting stock ownership  we will not be able to engage in certain transactions without the approval of these two shareholders 
these transactions include proxy contests  mergers  tender offers  open market purchase programs or other purchases of our class a common stock that could give our shareholders the opportunity to receive a higher price for their shares than the prevailing market price at the time of such purchases 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  we have in the past issued and may in the future issue shares of class b common stock in connection with certain acquisitions  upon exercise of certain stock options  and for other purposes 
class b shares have superior voting rights entitling the holder to ten votes for each share held on matters that we submit to a shareholder vote as compared with one vote per share in the case of our class a common stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock and to issue such shares without a shareholder vote 
it is possible that the provisions in our charter documents  the exercise of supervoting rights by holders of our 
table of contents class b common stock  our directors and officers ownership of a majority of the class b common stock and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock or additional shares of class b common stock may prevent or discourage third parties from acquiring us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  these factors may discourage third parties from bidding for our class a common stock at a premium over the market price for this stock 
these factors may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock  and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock

as of december  the carrying and fair value of these publicly held investments was million 
we have also invested in several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered to be in the start up or development stage  or in funds that invest in such companies 
we make investments in key business partners and other industry participants to establish important strategic relationships  expand existing relationships and achieve a return on our investment 
these investments are inherently risky  as the markets for the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
as such  we could lose our entire investment in these companies

these obligations are payable in varying monthly installments at a weighted average rate of per annum through the fair value of our debt and marketable debt securities fluctuates based on changes in interest rates  however  given the short term maturities of the bank credit facility and the stipulated judgment  we do not believe these instruments are subject to significant interest rate risk
