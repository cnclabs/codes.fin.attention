item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview amylin pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of drug candidates for the treatment of diabetes and other metabolic diseases 
we currently have two lead drug candidates in late stage development for the treatment of diabetes  symlin pramlintide acetate and exenatide  formerly referred to as ac in september  we announced a collaboration agreement with eli lilly and company  or lilly  for the global development and commercialization of exenatide  including sustained release formulations of the product candidate 
we have a third drug candidate  ac  for the treatment of atherosclerosis related cardiovascular disease  in early stage clinical development 
we recently acquired a phase program utilizing continuous infusion of glucagon like peptide  or glp  for the treatment of patients with severe congestive heart failure 
we are studying ac peptide yy  our preclinical candidate for the potential treatment of obesity 
we maintain a focused research and development program to discover and in license additional drug candidates for metabolic diseases 
since our inception in september  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been derived from fees and expense reimbursements under earlier symlin collaborative agreements  from interest income  and more recently  our exenatide collaboration agreement with lilly 
we currently have no product sales and have not received any revenues from the sale of our drug candidates 
we have been unprofitable since inception  and expect to incur additional operating losses for at least the next few years 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in january  we completed a public offering of approximately million shares common stock  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
results of operations revenue under collaborative agreement we had revenue from collaborative agreements of million in and no such revenues in and the revenue in is a result of the collaboration agreement with lilly for exenatide entered into in september and consists primarily of the amortization to revenue of a portion of the million non refundable up front payment made by lilly 
we expect to see an increase in revenue under collaborative agreements in as a result of the continued amortization of lilly s up front payments  possible future payments from lilly to us for a portion of development costs of exenatide and  pending further success of the exenatide development programs  possible future milestone payments from lilly 
recognition of the milestone payments to revenue will be subject to the completion of certain performance requirements and the expiration of stock conversion rights  if any  associated with such payments 
operating expenses total operating expenses were million in  million in and million in research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the million increase in research and development expenses in as compared to  reflects increased external costs associated with the expansion of our ongoing development programs  and to a lesser extent  costs associated with an increased number of employees required to support this growth 
the increase in external costs in consists primarily of costs incurred to conduct the three ongoing phase trials for exenatide and  to a lesser extent  costs associated with clinical trials for symlin and costs associated with manufacturing scale up for the exenatide and exenatide lar development programs 
we had approximately  and employees dedicated to our research and development activities at december   and respectively 
the million increase in research and development expenses in  as compared to  is approximately evenly split between an increase in external costs supporting our exenatide  exenatide lar  and ac development programs and an increase in our internal costs  primarily costs associated with an increased number of employees 
the increase in external costs in reflects costs incurred to conduct phase evaluations of exenatide  phase evaluations of exenatide lar  and increased costs incurred in connection with our exenatide lar development collaboration with alkermes 
these increased costs in were partially offset by a decrease in external costs for symlin 
in  we incurred higher costs for symlin  primarily associated with the filing of our nda in december of that year 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase materially in but at a lower rate of growth than we experienced in the planned increase will be primarily driven by the rate of further expansion of the exenatide and exenatide lar development programs 
the planned expansion of these programs includes additional clinical trials to support our planned nda for exenatide  additional phase studies for exenatide lar  costs associated with continued manufacturing scale up and costs to develop drug delivery devices 
development costs for symlin are not expected to change materially in and will consist of costs to complete the ongoing dose titration study  potential costs associated with a phase b clinical program for symlin and costs to further develop drug delivery devices 
the nature and timing of future costs related to the phase b program for symlin will be significantly influenced by results from the dose titration study 
furthermore  we may experience additional increased expenses due to the potential expansion of our recently acquired glp program and the continuation of our ac and ac development programs 
we also expect to increase our employee and infrastructure costs to support the planned growth in our development programs 
currently  our research and development efforts are focused on six programs in various stages of development as detailed in the following table compound development status planned milestones symlin fda approvable letter received complete ongoing clinical study in first half of dose titration study underway submit nda amendment in the first half of us commercial launch in late or early  pending regulatory approval exenatide three pivotal phase trials underway report initial phase trial results in mid complete phase program in second half of submit nda in exenatide phase evaluation report initial phase results in early lar initiate additional phase studies in mid glp phase evaluation report phase results in mid ac phase evaluation phase program ongoing ac preclinical evaluation submit ind in second half of from inception through  we devoted substantially all of our research and development efforts to symlin 
beginning in  the composition of our research and development costs started to include costs for our other drug candidates  primarily exenatide and exenatide lar 
expenditures related to the recently acquired glp program and our ac development program are expected to begin in based on our current plans and the current status of each of our six development programs  we expect the composition of our research and development expenses in will continue to be heavily weighted towards the exenatide and exenatide lar development programs 
our ability to execute the future development plans for each of our drug candidates  and the amount and allocation of future expenditures among them may vary widely and are dependent upon many factors  including  but not limited to our ability to secure sufficient financial resources independently or through collaborative arrangements  the results of current and planned clinical and preclinical trials for each drug candidate  the timing of regulatory submissions and approvals  and if approvals are received  time to market thereafter  technological advances  and the status of competitive products 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses in  compared to  reflects primarily an increase in pre marketing expenses for symlin  and to a lesser extent an increase in our number of employees and other infrastructure costs 
we had approximately  and employees dedicated to general and administrative activities at december   and  respectively 
in december  we hired a small sales force of representatives to copromote humatrope  lilly s recombinant human growth hormone product  pursuant to our collaboration with lilly 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to reflects an overall increase in our number of employees  increased facilities and other infrastructure costs required to support our growth  and costs associated with our commercial organization  including certain pre marketing activities related to symlin 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in  but at a higher rate than we experienced in  due to the recently hired sales force  increased pre marketing activities related to symlin and increased facilities and other infrastructure costs required to support our planned growth in more significant increases in general and administrative expenses are dependent upon the timing of regulatory approval and possible launch of symlin in the united states  currently projected for the end of or early these additional costs would include the scale up of the sales force for symlin  marketing and other infrastructure costs 
other income and expense interest and other income is principally comprised of interest income from investment of cash and investments 
interest and other income was million in  million in  and million in the decrease in compared to primarily reflects declining market interest rates in as compared to the decrease in compared to reflects a combination of both lower average cash and investments balances and declining market interest rates in as compared to interest and other expense is primarily comprised of interest expense resulting from long term debt obligations  principally debt to johnson johnson incurred pursuant to the terms of an earlier collaboration agreement 
the interest expense attributable to the debt to johnson johnson is a non cash expense  consisting of accrued interest added to the principal balance and the amortization of a debt discount 
we have also used equipment debt financing and capital leases to acquire certain laboratory and office equipment 
interest and other expense was million in  million in and million in net loss the net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in the increase in the net loss in compared to reflects the increased operating expenses  and the reduction in interest and other income  partially offset by the increase in revenue from collaborative agreements  discussed above 
the increase in the net loss in compared to reflects the increases in operating expenses  interest and other expense and the reduction in interest and other income discussed above 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next two years due to ongoing expenses associated with the continuation and potential expansion of our research and development programs  including the clinical development of symlin  exenatide  exenatide lar and our earlier stage development programs  the planned commercialization of symlin and related general and administrative support 
operating losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of expenses incurred and revenues recognized 
in  several class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our officers and directors alleging securities fraud in connection with various statements and alleged omissions relating to the development of symlin 
these lawsuits were consolidated into a single action 
if we are not successful in our defense of this lawsuit  we may be required to make significant payments to our stockholders 
the lawsuit is at an early stage and the extent or range of possible damages  if any  cannot yet be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  we have not recorded a provision for potential damages in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of common stock and preferred stock  public offerings of common stock  reimbursement of symlin development expenses through earlier collaboration agreements  payments received pursuant to our september exenatide collaboration with lilly and debt financings 
we will consider options to efficiently access capital markets to further fund the development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
the level at which we seek to access the capital markets and the timing of any action will depend on a number of factors including progress on our exenatide and symlin programs and prevailing market conditions 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at december  the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in reflects million in proceeds from a public offering of common stock in february and million received from lilly in september in connection with the collaboration agreement relating to exenatide  partially offset by approximately million of cash used to fund our operations during in january  we completed a public offering of common stock  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
at december   we owed johnson johnson approximately million pursuant to debt incurred in connection with a collaboration agreement that terminated in the amount presented in the consolidated balance sheet at december  of million is net of a debt discount of million  which represents the unamortized portion of the value of warrants issued to johnson johnson 
repayment obligations on this debt commence in june  however  repayment may be accelerated in the event that we enter into certain specified change in control transactions  specified types of agreements for symlin or certain types of financing arrangements subsequent to approval of the symlin nda by the fda 
additionally  we owe million pursuant to equipment financing  which is payable in equal monthly installments through december we used cash of million  million and million from our operating activities in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our use of cash from operations in reflects the receipt of an million up front  nonrefundable payment from lilly in september in connection with the collaboration agreement and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
our investing activities used million  provided million and used million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
investing activities in all three years consisted primarily of purchases and sales of short term investments  but also included purchases of laboratory and office equipment and additional patents and patent applications 
financing activities provided million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts consisted primarily of proceeds from sales of common stock  partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
cash expenditures for research and development activities are expected to continue to increase in  driven primarily by continued expenditures to complete the phase program for exenatide  planned expenditures associated with manufacturing scale up for exenatide and exenatide lar  costs associated with the acquisition and potential expansion of the phase glp development program and potential expansion of our earlier stage development programs 
pursuant to our collaboration agreement with lilly  we are responsible for the first million of development costs for exenatide and exenatide lar subsequent to the consummation of the collaboration agreement 
we expect to reach this cumulative amount sometime in the second half of subsequent to that time  lilly will equally share with us in us development costs for exenatide and exenatide lar 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in at a higher rate of growth than we experienced in due primarily to costs associated with the co promotion of humatrope 
more significant increases in general and administrative expenses are projected for later in and are dependent on the timing of regulatory approval and possible launch of symlin in the united states 
at december   we are committed to purchase approximately million of commercial grade symlin bulk drug material in the subsequent twelve month period 
if fda approval for symlin is received  our expenditures to secure commercial grade bulk drug material will increase substantially  including a commitment to purchase approximately million of additional material pursuant to an agreement with johnson johnson 
we are also obligated to purchase this material if we enter into a collaboration agreement for symlin or if there is a change in control of amylin 
if none of these events occur  we have no obligation to purchase this material from johnson johnson 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and maturity dates as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total we anticipate continuing our ongoing development programs and may begin other long term development projects 
these projects may require many years and substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful 
therefore  we may need to obtain additional funds from outside sources to continue research and development activities  fund operating expenses  pursue regulatory approvals and build sales and marketing capabilities  as necessary 
these sources may include private and or public offerings of common or preferred stock or debt  revenues and expense reimbursements from collaborative agreements for one or more of our drug candidates  or a combination thereof 
there can be no assurances that such financing will be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of our product development programs 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for symlin and exenatide  whether regulatory approvals for the marketing of symlin and exenatide are received  our ability to receive milestone payments pursuant to our exenatide collaboration with lilly  our ability and the extent to which we establish commercialization arrangements for symlin  our ability to progress with other ongoing and new preclinical and clinical trials  the extent of these trials  scientific progress in our other research and development programs  the magnitude of these programs  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing or defending ourselves against patents  competing technological and market developments  changes in collaborative relationships and any costs of manufacturing scale up 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory costs and patent costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our consolidated financial statements on page f 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
in addition  we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
amounts received for upfront product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  and the expiration of stock conversion rights  if any  associated with such payments 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
inventory capitalization we capitalize inventory costs associated with certain drug candidates prior to receipt of regulatory approval  based on management s judgment of probable future commercialization 
we would be required to expense these capitalized costs upon a change in such judgment  due to  among other factors  a decision denying approval of the drug candidate by regulatory agencies 
at december   capitalized inventory  all of which relates to symlin  totaled million 
additionally  at december   we are committed to purchase million of symlin bulk drug inventory in the subsequent twelve month period 
our ability to recover the value of this inventory is dependent upon our ability to obtain regulatory approvals to market symlin in the united states and or europe 
the significant risk associated with our ability to obtain marketing approvals  specifically in the united states  is our ability to achieve satisfactory results from the ongoing clinical work for symlin 
if we do not achieve satisfactory results from these trials or are otherwise unable to obtain regulatory approvals for symlin  we will not likely recover the value of this inventory 
additionally  approximately million of the million of total symlin inventory is in finished dosage form  and was manufactured in our nda suggests that the finished inventory would have a thirty six month expiration period 
we evaluate the recoverability of our finished inventory in consideration of our expected regulatory timelines 
during  we determined that our regulatory timelines were extending due to the time involved to complete the required clinical work for symlin intended to support a planned amendment to our nda 
accordingly  we established a valuation reserve of million for our finished symlin inventory during patent costs we capitalize some of the costs incurred to file patent applications 
these costs are amortized over the lesser of the remaining useful life of the related technology or the patent life  commencing on the date the patent is issued 
at december   capitalized costs related to issued patents total approximately million net of accumulated amortization and approximately million related to unissued patents 
we expense all costs related to abandoned patent applications 
if we elect to abandon any of our currently issued or unissued patents  the related expense could be material to our results of operations for the period of abandonment 
in  we abandoned patents with a net book value of approximately million 
additionally  if the useful life of the related technologies is reduced  amortization of the associated costs would be accelerated 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash primarily in us government securities  asset backed securities and debt instruments of financial institutions and corporations with strong credit ratings 
these instruments have various short term maturities 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the instruments held are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive investments 
our debt is not subject to significant swings in valuation as interest rates on our debt approximate current interest rates 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
