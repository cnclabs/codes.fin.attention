using our proprietary xenerex tm technology  we also develop human monoclonal antibodies for infectious diseases and other therapeutic applications 
avanir successfully developed the first over the counter otc drug that has been approved by the united states food and drug administration fda for the treatment of cold sores 
marketed in the us by glaxosmithkline consumer healthcare  abreva docosanol cream was launched in late and has been the largest selling consumer healthcare product in the us for the treatment of cold sores since 
table of contents introduction 
from inception of the license agreement with glaxosmithkline subsidiary  sb pharmco puerto rico  through september   avanir has received over million in license fees  milestone payments and royalties on abreva contract sales and sale of certain interests in future royalties 
in fiscal  avanir sold an undivided interest in its license agreement with glaxosmithkline to drug royalty usa for million 
avanir retained the right to receive of all royalties under the glaxosmithkline license agreement for annual sales of abreva in excess of million 
avanir also retained its rights to market and or license the cold sore product outside north america and to develop docosanol cream for other indications 
outside the us  docosanol cream is approved for otc marketing in sweden  canada  the republic of korea and israel 
the swedish medical products agency mpa approved docosanol cream for marketing in november the swedish mpa is a reference state for the mutual recognition process for regulatory approvals by other states in the european union 
in addition to the glaxosmithkline license agreement  avanir has license agreements for docosanol cream in italy  the republic of korea  israel and egypt 
the product is already being marketed under the trade names herepair in korea and abrax in israel 
avanir s drug development pipeline consists of clinical  preclinical and earlier stage drug discovery programs 
neurodex is in phase iii clinical development for the treatment of pba and should be ready for submission of a new drug application nda with the fda in pba affects a diverse population of patients with neurologic disorders  such as alzheimer s disease  multiple sclerosis ms  lou gehrig s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als  parkinson s disease  and those with neuronal damage following stroke and traumatic brain injury 
we have successfully completed one phase ii study of neurodex for the treatment of neuropathic pain 
we are also engaged in a phase i clinical trial of avp for the treatment of allergy and asthma and have published interim results of single rising dose studies 
our preclinical research and drug discovery programs are directed primarily toward large therapeutic areas  including cholesterol reduction and other inflammatory diseases 
we also are using our xenerex tm technology to produce human monoclonal antibodies for anthrax  cytomegalovirus  and other infectious diseases and selected targets for collaborative partners 
licensing our products and partnering with other companies represent important sources of funds for us to achieve cash inflows and pursue development of several potential drugs and technology platforms 
we intend to fund our current preclinical development programs  if successful  at least until we are able to obtain investigational new drug ind status and begin clinical trials 
thereafter  our strategy is to seek partners for co development or to grant licenses to develop and market our potential new drugs 
co development would allow us to share development costs and product revenues 
licensing would provide an opportunity to receive license fees and milestone payments as the product is developed and royalties on product sales if a product were to be successfully launched 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical information and assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and circumstances that may impact the company in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management 
our critical accounting policies regarding revenue recognition are in the following areas milestone payments in license agreements  royalties on licensed products  sale of rights to future royalties  and recognition of revenues in research contracts 
our critical accounting policies regarding expense recognition are principally related to research contracts 
our critical accounting policies also include the valuation of long lived and intangible assets 

table of contents milestone payments in license agreements we recognize revenues from license fees when the performance requirements have been met  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of fees is probable 
we defer revenues and recognize them ratably over the life of the agreement when we have continuing obligations to perform under the agreement 
our largest and most significant license agreement is with sb pharmco puerto rico  inc  a subsidiary of glaxosmithkline glaxosmithkline 
on march   we transferred the rights to manufacture  use  and sell abreva in the united states and canada to glaxosmithkline and gave them full control  authority and responsibility over research  development  registration including actions required to obtain appropriate government approvals  and commercialization of the product in those territories 
glaxosmithkline has achieved and paid all of the performance milestones under the agreement 
with regard to the milestones  we have no further performance obligations 
future revenues  if any  to be earned under the glaxosmithkline agreement will come solely from royalty revenues 
we expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future 
we expect that each license agreement will have its own set of circumstances and terms of performance 
we will consider the specific facts and circumstances of each license agreement to determine the appropriate revenue recognition for such items  including nonrefundable up front fees and milestone payments and taking into consideration when the earnings process is complete and collection is reasonably assured 
royalties on licensed products we recognize royalty revenues from our licensed products based on the reported sales by our licensees and computed in accordance with the specific terms of the license agreements 
since the launch of abreva in october through september   substantially all of our royalties have come from glaxosmithkline 
we have entered into additional license agreements that contain royalties as a source of revenues  and we expect to enter into additional similar license agreements with foreign based companies 
sales of rights to future royalties in december  we sold an undivided interest in our license agreement with glaxosmithkline to drug royalty usa  inc drug royalty usa and received a payment of million at closing and an additional million in april because of our ongoing involvement with glaxosmithkline in earning future royalty revenues  we have recorded the amounts received from drug royalty usa  net of costs of the transaction and after the forgiveness of certain advances  as deferred revenue 
see note  asset sale  in the accompanying financial statements 
the amount recorded as deferred revenue is being recognized as revenue under the units of revenue method 
under this method  the amount of deferred revenue being recognized as revenue in each period is calculated by multiplying i the ratio of the royalty payments due to drug royalty usa for the period to the total remaining royalties that we expect glaxosmithkline will pay drug royalty usa over the term of the agreement  by ii the unamortized deferred revenue amount 
the portion of deferred revenue classified as part of current liabilities represents the amount we expect to realize as revenue within the next months 
recognition of revenues in research contracts in certain circumstances  we may enter into research contracts or collaborations having obligations to deliver to the customer multiple products and or services multiple deliverables in exchange for fees or milestone payments 
such contracts could include antibody generation services agreements and other forms of research collaborations 
antibody generation services 
as of september   we were engaged in work on two research collaboration agreements  both of which have research initiation fees 
in these agreements  the customer provides us with the target antigens 
we then perform research services to develop potential antibodies for those antigens 
if we are able to estimate the period of service in the contract in advance of beginning the work  then we recognize such research initiation fees ratably as revenue over the estimated period of service 
if 
table of contents we are unable to identify the period of service in the contract in advance of beginning the work  we defer research initiation fees and recognize such fees as revenue once we have completed our efforts to create the antibodies 
in the research phases of the research collaboration agreement  we may receive payment either to start a research phase or to complete a research phase including receipt by the customer of the deliverable 
we recognize revenue once the product has been delivered  because the earning process would be complete and an exchange has been made 
factors taken into consideration in recognizing revenues include the following the performance criteria have been met  any undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products or services  and payment for the delivered products or services is not contingent on delivery of the remaining products or services 
other research contracts 
as with all our research contracts  including the up front initiation fee  we defer revenue recognition until services have been rendered or products eg developed antibodies are delivered 
the milestones established within the contract are set to approximate the effort associated with the completion of each phase 
recognition of expenses in research contracts pursuant to management s assessment of the progress that has been made on clinical trials and other research contracts  we recognize expenses related to such contracts as the services are provided 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  and or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets or long lived assets are not recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that have not been previously recorded 
nature of operating expenses avanir s operating expenses are influenced substantially by the amount of spending devoted to clinical development programs and drug discovery research 
during the past three years  we have substantially expanded our drug development pipeline  which requires that we allocate significant amounts of our resources to research and development activities  which have increased substantially over the same period 
our spending on new business development and on general and administrative support staff tends to follow trends in our spending for research  but to a lesser extent 
other components of our operating costs include maintenance and operation of our laboratory and office facilities  depreciation  professional and consulting fees related to clinical trials and regulatory compliance  insurance  and investor relations 
we expect spending on research and development to continue to represent approximately of our operating expenses for fiscal building rent amounting to approximately million in fiscal has scheduled rent increases of approximately a year for at least the next three years 
our business is exposed to significant risks  as discussed in the section entitled risk factors that might affect future operations  which may result in 
table of contents additional expenses  delays and lost opportunities that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
effects of inflation we believe the impact of inflation and changing prices on net sales revenues and on net income from continuing operations has been immaterial during the past three years 
prices for electricity increased in early fiscal  however  our operations do not consume a substantial amount of electricity other than for providing lighting and air conditioning for our offices and laboratories 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years and revenues vs 
revenues in fiscal amounted to million  compared to million in fiscal revenues for fiscal included million in revenues that the company recognized from the sale of abreva royalty rights to drug royalty usa and  from government research grants 
revenues for fiscal included a final million milestone payment relating to the one year anniversary of abreva product launch and million in royalty revenues on abreva product sales 
other revenues in fiscal included  in federal and state grant revenues   in sales of docosanol  and  in research contracts and license fees from other areas 
during fiscal  we expect to recognize approximately million in revenues from the sale transaction to drug royalty usa  with a corresponding reduction in deferred revenue 
also during the fiscal year  we expect to earn approximately  from sales of docosanol to licensees and  in revenues from research being performed under government research grants 
potential revenues from license fees  milestone payments  and royalties on foreign sales of docosanol cream will depend substantially on the timing of approvals by foreign regulatory agencies and our ability to enter into additional license arrangements 
potential revenues from licensing and or selling products in clinical and preclinical development  including neurodex for the treatment of pba and neuropathic pain and treatments for inflammatory diseases and high cholesterol  are less predictable 
revenue generating contracts partnering  licensing and research collaborations have been  and will continue to be  an important part of avanir s business development strategy 
we intend to partner with pharmaceutical companies that can help fund avanir s research in exchange for sharing in the rights to commercialize new drugs resulting from this research 
we have licensed and continue to seek licensees in other countries for docosanol cream and other potential products in our development pipeline 
research collaborations also represent an important way to achieve our development goals  while sharing in the risks and the opportunities that come from such development efforts 

table of contents as of september   we had several contracts and grants that are generating or could generate revenues in the future to help fund our research and development programs 
five contracts are in the form of docosanol cream license agreements  one contract is for a neurodex license  and two contracts are in the form of antibody research service agreements 
for the last three years  the glaxosmithkline license arrangement has been our most significant revenue source  representing approximately of the company s cumulative revenues during the last three fiscal years 
a list of our revenue generating contracts is set forth in the following table 
revenue generating contracts product license  sale  company or research grant description service or research glaxosmithkline undivided interest in the license agreement for abreva us and canada cold sore product license drug royalty usa license purchase agreement with drug royalty usa represents an undivided interest in the abreva license agreement us and canada sale of undivided interest in abreva license agreement and royalties miscellaneous docosanol licenses outside north america israel cts chemical industries  ltd

operating expenses 
our total operating expenses increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase in operating expenses was primarily caused by a increase in spending on research and development programs 
research and development programs accounted for and of total operating expenses for fiscal and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses accounted for and of total operating expenses for fiscal and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses accounted for and of total operating expenses for fiscal and  respectively 
these and other costs are more fully described below 
research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal we had four clinical trials and studies under way throughout most of fiscal  compared to only one clinical trial in fiscal the phase iii clinical trial and open label study of neurodex in the treatment of pba accounted for million  or  of total r d spending 
completion of toxicology  submitting an investigational new drug ind application to the fda  and completion of the initial dose levels in phase i clinical trials of our lead compound for the treatment of allergy and asthma accounted for million  or  of total r d spending 
an additional of r d spending was devoted to the development of neurodex in the treatment of neuropathic pain  currently in phase ii clinical 
table of contents development 
approximately of spending was focused on research on a group of compounds targeting mif as a potential treatment for inflammatory diseases 
in fiscal  preclinical research focused on a novel treatment for allergy and asthma  including toxicology studies  scaled up manufacture of the lead compound  development of second generation compounds  and other related contract research  accounted for of total r d spending 
also in fiscal  clinical development of neurodex for the treatment of pba  including a phase iii clinical trial in patients with lou gehrig s disease  accounted for of r d spending 
r d related to the treatment of neuropathic pain and research on candidates for regulating mif each accounted for of total r d spending 
the balance of r d activities in both fiscal and was primarily related to other preclinical programs addressing cholesterol reduction and programs funded by government research grants 
pharmaceutical r d programs  by their very nature  require a substantial amount of financial and human resources and there is no assurance that any drug candidate will be approved for marketing by domestic and or foreign regulatory agencies 
the later stages of clinical development typically require substantially greater funds for development than the earlier stages 
thus  for many of our larger development programs  we intend to license our technology or partner with other pharmaceutical companies that have substantially greater financial resources 
we expect that our licensees will continue to develop and fund those projects and pay us up front license fees  milestone payments  and royalties on product sales if those products are successfully developed and approved for marketing by the fda and foreign regulatory agencies 
we caution that many of our development efforts could experience delays  setbacks and failures  with no assurance that any of our clinical research or our potential licensees or partners will ever reach the stage of an nda with the fda or that any nda will be approved 
the following table sets forth the status of  and costs attributable to  our proprietary research and clinical development programs 
research and development projects and other research programs expense three months ended fiscal year ended inception estimated september  september  through cost to september  complete project company funded projects develop neurodex for fda marketing approval in treating pba 
estimated timing to complete remaining phases of project necessary to submit an nda with fda second half  m develop neurodex for neuropathic pain 
phase ii open label study completed develop avp as a treatment for allergy and asthma 
estimated timing to complete phase i  bioanalytical work and license the product  m research on regulating the target mif as a potential treatment for inflammatory diseases 
estimated timing to complete phase i and to license the product m 
table of contents three months ended fiscal year ended inception estimated september  september  through cost to september  complete project government funded projects preclinical r d for potential treatments for genital herpes  cmv and anthrax  and development of a blood donor program for infectious diseases 
estimated timing to complete the various projects is up to two years m other preclinical research projects research on potential treatments for cancer  lowering cholesterol and treating infectious diseases 
costs and timing to complete preclinical r d are unpredictable because of the uncertainty of outcomes of the research total at september   we held the worldwide rights to manufacture  market and sell all of the products in clinical development and any of the products that might come from our internal r d programs 
all dates in the schedule refer to calendar year 
each project includes allocation of laboratory occupancy costs 
m refers to millions 
estimated costs and timing to complete the projects are subject to the availability of funds 
inception dates are on or after october   at which time we began identifying and tracking costs for these research programs 
clinical development  licensing and or co promotion strategies are being evaluated 
see research and development program strategy 
state and federal research grants totaling million are for research related to genital herpes  anthrax  cytomegalovirus cmv and a blood donor program 
research and development program strategy we are pursuing an r d program strategy that is intended to provide a stream of potential products in various stages of development as well as in several therapeutic areas and technology platforms 
our approach is not to rely on any one therapeutic area or technology platform  but to extend our development expertise across several therapeutic areas  technology platforms and research targets that each could lead to one or more products 
to help conserve cash resources as we continue these r d programs  we intend to use our own funds for clinical trials that are relatively small and license our products and technologies to others when we expect the development costs will exceed available cash resources 
we are pursuing this strategy because the costs of pursuing all of our development programs through all clinical phases are beyond our available cash resources 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in licensing any of our products or technologies 
if we are unable to license one or more of our products and technologies in a timely manner  then we may have to slow down the rate of development of some of our early stage programs  which could allow competition to catch up or surpass our programs 
neurodex for the treatment of pba 
we are currently engaged in a patient phase iii clinical trial of neurodex for the treatment of pba in patients with multiple sclerosis 
we are also engaged in a patient open label study for the treatment of pba in a broader pool of patients who could have any one of several neurodegenerative diseases 
prior to engaging in these studies  we had completed the initial phase iii clinical trial of pba in patients with als  in may our goal is to submit an nda with the fda in the second half of the calendar year 

table of contents neurodex for the treatment of neuropathic pain 
in june  we announced the completion of a four week open label dose escalation study of neurodex in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy 
results of the non placebo controlled phase ii study indicated that neurodex was well tolerated up to the highest target dose  and patients reported decreased pain intensity that was significantly different from baseline p 
out of adult patients with diabetic neuropathy who experience pain on a daily basis in the lower extremities  three did not complete the study 
of those patients not completing the study  two were due to adverse events one serious and not related  one serious and possibly related and one due to inability to comply with the protocol 
commonly reported adverse events reported by three or more individuals included nausea  constipation  diarrhea  dry mouth  fatigue  dizziness  insomnia  headache  upper respiratory tract infection  and somnolence 
most adverse events were either mild or moderate in intensity  and of participants completed the study 
this program remains in the phase ii stage of clinical development  while we evaluate alternatives for continued development of neurodex in the treatment of neuropathic pain  including continuing development with our own expenditures or with the funding of a potential co promotion partner or potential licensee 
neurodex r d spending strategy 
we are currently evaluating alternatives for commercialization of neurodex for pba and neuropathic pain 
such alternatives include  among others  developing our own sales force for certain market segments  and co promotion or licensing arrangements  possibly with a partner that could contribute to the development costs of the program 
there can be no assurances as to the timing of a license or co promotion arrangement  if any 
development program for allergy and asthma ige regulator 
in fiscal  we increased the estimated costs to complete the project by million and timing to complete the project by one year to allow for additional toxicology studies and more extensive phase i testing that were required by the fda 
in october  we announced that avp was well tolerated at single rising doses up to five milligrams in a randomized  placebo controlled phase i clinical trial 
presence of the drug in the bloodstream  or exposure  was demonstrated at all four oral dose levels tested between one and five milligrams 
avp is a novel drug molecule discovered by avanir scientists that is intended to inhibit the production of ige  a well known mediator of allergy and asthma 
phase a trials are intended to establish safety of the drug in single rising doses in healthy volunteers and to assess the compound s effect on certain disease biomarkers 
these trials will be followed by phase ib clinical trials using rising multi doses in healthy patients 
assuming the successful completion of phase a clinical trials and adequate funds to continue development without a partner  we estimate that phase ib clinical trials for this compound will be completed assuming these results are favorable  we expect to license the drug to a larger pharmaceutical company for further development 
anti inflammatory research program mif inhibitor 
we are currently conducting research on several potential drug candidates capable of inhibiting or blocking the activity of macrophage migration inhibitory factor 
our research indicates that mif may serve as a potential drug target in a variety of diseases  including rheumatoid arthritis  crohn s disease  colitis and asthma 
assuming we are successful in finding a lead compound and submitting an ind to the fda  we intend to license the compound to another pharmaceutical company for further development 
any delays to our product development timeline or in submitting an ind could cause a similar delay in the timing of when we expect that we could license our mif technology 
government research contracts 
avanir also is engaged in research funded by million in government research grants 
the government research grants are to be used for investigating the market potential for a topical genital herpes treatment  conducting research on various docosanol based formulations for genital herpes  development of antibodies to anthrax toxins and cytomegalovirus  and development of a blood donor program intended to find high affinity antibodies to infectious diseases 
we expect the current government funded research programs will continue through fiscal year cholesterol reduction we are engaged in preclinical research focused on certain types of small molecules that can be taken orally as a potential treatment or means of prevention of hyper cholesterolemia high cholesterol 
cholesterol is transported in the blood in large cholesterol rich particles called lipoproteins 
generally  low density lipoproteins ldl deliver the cholesterol to peripheral tissues including aorta 
table of contents and coronary arteries  whereas high density lipoproteins hdl remove excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues  and transport it to the liver for elimination 
we are evaluating certain compounds that may be capable of accelerating the removal of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues 
because our research is at the preclinical stage of development  we are unable to predict the cost and timing for development of a drug 
monoclonal antibodies research in fiscal  we collaborated with three other companies in efforts to use our xenerex tm technology to produce fully human monoclonal antibodies for potential disease targets provided by those companies 
the research collaborations provided us with advance payments to conduct the research  and the possibility for milestone payments if any of the antibody products we developed reached further stages of development 
if a product were eventually sold  we would receive royalties on product sales 
in december we announced that we had entered into a license agreement with peregrine pharmaceuticals for one of the antibodies that we had developed for the treatment of solid tumor cancers 
we changed our emphasis during the year to focus more on finding antibodies for our own disease targets  particularly infectious diseases 
we successfully developed multiple antibodies that demonstrate high potency against anthrax toxins in vitroand in vivoand against anthrax spores in vivo 
much of our work targeting infectious diseases has been funded by government research grants 
because all of our research is at a very early preclinical stage of development and is unpredictable in terms of the outcome  we are unable to predict the cost and timing for development of any antibody or drug 
other collaborative research programs under an agreement signed in  we provided clinical and preclinical research information on docosanol cream to shanghai new asiatic pharmaceutical company  ltd 
for the purposes of evaluating the regulatory approval requirements and size of the markets for the treatment of cold sores  genital herpes and herpes zoster shingles in the people s republic of china 
in we terminated the collaboration with shanghai new asiatic  because of the lack of progress that they had made 
presently  we are not pursuing any further research collaborations in the people s republic of china 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased slightly to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal these increased expenses primarily relate to a  increase in building occupancy costs  including utilities  maintenance and insurance resulting from the increase in usable office space  which amounted to  square feet in fiscal  compared to  square feet in fiscal  and increased legal and consulting costs relating to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and related rules and regulations 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal  compared to million during fiscal higher expenses in fiscal were related to market research and planning and preparation for product launch of neurodex for the treatment of pba 
fiscal expenses included legal  travel and consulting costs related to out licensing docosanol cream in europe and the middle east  establishing business relations in the people s republic of china  and additional licensing and other commercial development activities related to marketing our antibody generation services 
other income and expenses vs 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal  compared to  million in fiscal the decrease in interest income during fiscal was primarily due to lower investment balances and lower average interest rates on investments compared with fiscal other income 
other income for fiscal  consisting of rental income  decreased to  compared to  in fiscal fiscal included fees earned under a contract that provided a period of exclusivity in negotiations 
avanir also received rental income from healthscan metabolic imaging  llc for sharing an emergency power generator under an equipment lease agreement 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal lower interest expense for fiscal was due to lower interest rates on extended payment plans for our 
table of contents insurance policies and a reduction in the principal amounts due under capital leases initiated in fiscal interest expense for fiscal was primarily related to the addition of  in new capital equipment lease financing transactions for an emergency power generator and various new pieces of laboratory equipment 
net loss vs 
for fiscal  the net loss attributable to common shareholders was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in fiscal we expect to continue to pursue our drug development strategy focused on the development of neurodex  followed by other programs in earlier stages of development that are in large therapeutic areas and that have significant partnering and licensing potential 
to help fund and develop our products  we intend to seek licensees and partners to share the costs of development 
some of these potential license arrangements could materially change our outlook for future revenues and costs 
however  the timing of such potential arrangements is unpredictable 
to reach the stage of partnering or licensing our product candidates or technologies or marketing our own products  we expect to continue to invest primarily in our clinical development programs  which we expect will contribute to a loss for fiscal comparison of fiscal years and revenues vs 
revenues in fiscal decreased to million  compared to million in fiscal the million decrease in revenues for fiscal resulted primarily from the completion of milestone payments under the license agreement with our licensee  glaxosmithkline  in october revenues for fiscal included a final million milestone payment upon reaching the one year anniversary of abreva product launch and million in royalty revenues on abreva product sales 
other revenues in fiscal included  in federal and state grant revenues   in sales of the active ingredient docosanol  and  in contract and license fees from other areas 
revenues in fiscal included million in milestone payments and million in royalty revenues on abreva product sales 
other fiscal revenues included  in government grant revenues  and  in contract and license fees from other areas 
expenses vs 
operating expenses 
our total operating expenses increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal operating expenses in fiscal were higher than fiscal by million 
the net increase in operating expenses during fiscal is described below

we also spent million in r d related to the treatment of neuropathic pain 
we also spent million in fiscal on preclinical research focused on a novel treatment for allergy and asthma  including toxicology studies  scaled up manufacture of the lead compound  development of second generation compounds  and other contract research 
the balance of r d activities was primarily related to other preclinical programs addressing inflammation and cholesterol reduction and antibody generation technology

the balance of r d activities was primarily related to other preclinical programs addressing inflammation and cholesterol reduction  and antibody generation technology 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  compared to million during fiscal these increased expenses primarily relate to increased staff size and higher administrative support costs for most of fiscal as the company increased its level of operating activity in drug discovery  clinical development  and business development  and increased building occupancy costs including utilities  maintenance and insurance 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal  compared to million during fiscal fiscal expenses included legal  travel and consulting costs related to out licensing docosanol cream in europe and the middle east  establishing business relations in the people s republic of china  and additional licensing and other commercial development activities related to marketing our antibody generation services 
fiscal expenses primarily reflected travel  legal and overall business development staff costs necessary to pursue international licensing of docosanol cream 
other income and expenses vs 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest income during fiscal was primarily due to lower investment balances and lower interest rates on investments compared with fiscal other income
