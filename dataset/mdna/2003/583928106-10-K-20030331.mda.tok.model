item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended december    and in addition  this section contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions 
certain factors that could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements are described in the investment considerations section on page critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec has recently issued cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective  or 
table of contents complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change materially in subsequent periods 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
significant estimates made by the company include valuation of loans  evaluation of the recoverability of accounts receivable and income tax assets  and the assessment of litigation and other contingencies 
the company s ability to collect accounts receivable and recover the value of its loans depends on a number of factors  including financial conditions and its ability to enforce provisions of its contracts in the event of disputes  through litigation if necessary  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  to record net assets and liabilities at estimated realizable values 
the matters that give rise to such provisions are inherently uncertain and may require complex and subjective judgments 
although the company believes that estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at december   are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from the estimated amounts recorded in the company s financial statements 
general medallion financial corp 
the company is a specialty finance company that has a leading position in originating and servicing loans that finance taxicab medallions and various types of commercial businesses 
since  the year in which we went public  we have increased our medallion loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of  and our commercial loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 
our total assets under our management  which includes assets serviced for third party investors  were approximately  as of december   and have grown from  at the end of  a compound annual growth rate of 
the company s loan related earnings depend primarily on its level of net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the total yield on the company s loan portfolio and the average cost of funds 
the company funds its operations through a wide variety of interest bearing sources  such as revolving bank facilities  bank term debt  debentures issued to and guaranteed by the sba  and senior secured notes 
net interest income fluctuates with changes in the yield on the company s loan portfolio and changes in the cost of funds  as well as changes in the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities held by the company 
net interest income is also affected by economic  regulatory  and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand  and the availability of funding to finance the company s lending activities 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice on a different basis than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company also invests in small businesses in selected industries through its subsidiary mci 
mci s investments are typically in the form of secured debt instruments with fixed interest rates accompanied by warrants to purchase an equity interest for a nominal exercise price such warrants are included in equity investments on the consolidated balance sheets 
interest income is earned on the debt investments 
realized gains or losses on investments are recognized when the investments are sold or written off 
the realized gains or losses represent the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio assets  if any  and the cost of such portfolio assets 
in addition  changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments are recorded and represent the net change in the estimated fair values of the portfolio assets at the end of the period as compared with their estimated fair values at the beginning of the period 
generally  realized gains losses on investments and changes in unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments are inversely related 
when an appreciated asset is sold to realize a gain  a decrease in the previously recorded unrealized appreciation occurs 
conversely  when a loss previously recorded as an unrealized loss is realized by the sale or other disposition of a depreciated portfolio asset  the reclassification of the loss from unrealized to realized causes an increase in net unrealized appreciation and an increase in realized loss 
the company s investment in media as a wholly owned portfolio investment company is also subject to quarterly assessment of fair value 
the company uses media s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value  and records the result as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
economic conditions in new york city in the terrorist attacks on new york city on september  created a tremendous amount of actual and collateral damage to the city  and to the people and businesses that live  work  and operate there 
the slowdown in traffic  tourism  and other personal concerns resulted in initial operating problems for certain of our medallion individual and fleet customers 
it also effected some of our commercial borrowers 
the taxi top advertising business  many of whose ads are from broadway 
table of contents shows  suffered short term contract cancellations from these and other customers  which had a gross revenue impact of approximately  during the attacks also further exacerbated the recessionary trends  which had become more apparent as unfolded 
the effects of a general economic slowdown impacted the company as evidenced by increased delinquencies and nonperforming loans  increased prepayment activity as borrowers sought lower rate financing with the company or other lenders  stresses on medallion and other collateral values  primarily in chicago  and by reduced levels of advertising in media 
as a result of the above  the company reassessed the loss potential on the loan portfolio  servicing asset  and other receivables which resulted in charges of  in the third quarter to provide reserves against or write down the values of those assets which were impacted by the attacks and the recession in the economy 
trends in investment portfolio the company s investment income is driven by the principal amount of and yields on its investment portfolio 
to identify trends in the yields  the portfolio is grouped by medallion loans  commercial loans  and equity investments 
the following table illustrates the company s investments at fair value and the portfolio yields at the dates indicated

table of contents portfolio summary total portfolio yield the weighted average yield of the total portfolio at december  was  which is a decrease of basis points from at december  the total weighted average portfolio yield decreased basis points to at december  from at december  the decreases primarily reflected the reductions in the general level of interest rates in the economy  demonstrated by the reduction in the prime rate from to during the course of with a further reduction to by year end the general rate decrease is partially mitigated by the sizable number of fixed rate medallion loans which reprice at longer intervals  and the generally high yields including some at fixed rates  on the commercial portfolio 
the company expects to try to continue increasing both the percentage of commercial loans in the total portfolio and the origination of floating and adjustable rate loans and non new york medallion loans 
medallion loan portfolio the company s loans comprised of the total portfolio of  at december   compared to of the total portfolio of  at december  and of the total portfolio of  at december  the medallion loan portfolio decreased by  or in  reflecting reduction in most markets  particularly in new york  and the reclassification of certain chicago loans to owned medallions 
the company declined to renew more marginable credits  slowed origination activity  and continued efforts to participate loans to third party lenders  for the purpose of conserving cash resources for debt service 
the company retains a portion of these participating loans and earns a fee for servicing the loans for the third parties 
total medallion loans serviced for third parties were  at december  the weighted average yield of the medallion loan portfolio at december  was  a decrease of basis points from at december   which was down basis points from at december  the decrease in yield at december  primarily reflected the generally lower level of interest rates in the economy 
at december   of the owned chicago medallions are included of the medallion loan portfolio represented loans outside new york compared to and at year end and  respectively 
medallion continues to focus its efforts on originating higher yielding medallion loans outside the new york market 
collateral appreciation participation loans during the first half  the company originated collateral appreciation participation loans collateralized by chicago taxi medallions of  of which  was syndicated to other financial institutions 
in consideration for modifications from its normal taxi medallion lending terms  the company offered loans at higher loan to value ratios  and is entitled to earn additional interest income based upon any increase in the value of all  of the collateral 
during  additional interest income was recorded  compared to a decrease of  for  which was reflected in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations and in accrued interest receivable on the consolidated balance sheets 
during  of the medallions were returned to the company in lieu of repayment of the loans 
as a result   of these loans was carried in other assets  and  was carried in medallion loans  in total representing of the company s assets 
in addition  the borrower had not paid interest due of  subsequently  the company reached agreement to sell of the medallions to a new borrower at book value  upon the transfer of the ownership of the medallion licenses by the city of chicago  and medallions for  were reclassified back to medallion loans at year end  reflecting the transfers to date 
the company also has been in discussions with a buyer for the remaining returned medallions  and reached agreement on a term payout of the interest due with the original borrower  which is carried on nonaccrual  although payments continue to be made 
as a regulated investment company  the company is required to mark to market these investments on a quarterly basis  just as it does on all of its other investments 
the company believes that it has adequately calculated the fair market value of these investments in each accounting period  by relying upon information such as recent and historical medallion sale prices 
the remaining loans for medallions are due in june  but may be prepaid at the borrowers option beginning in december the borrower has indicated its interest in refinancing the transaction and the company expects to complete the refinance of the loans during the first quarter  including the syndicated portion  at the rate and terms prevailing at that time 
however  there can be no assurances that such refinancing will occur 

table of contents commercial loan portfolio since  and until  the company has shifted the total portfolio mix toward a higher percentage of commercial loans  which historically have had higher yields than its medallion loans  and represent of the total investment portfolio as of december  commercial loans declined by  or during reflecting decreases in all business lines  particularly in sba section a and asset based lending businesses  reflecting the slowdown in originations due to liquidity constraints  and the sales of certain assets 
the weighted average yield of the commercial loan portfolio at december  was  an increase of basis points from at december   which was down basis points from at december  the increase in primarily reflected the payoff or sale of lower yielding section a and asset based loans to both improve liquidity and enhance the portfolio yield 
the decrease in primarily reflected sensitivity of the yield to movements in the prime rate  which fell basis points during and basis points in  after rising for much of the company continues to originate adjustable rate and floating rate loans tied to the prime rate to help mitigate its interest rate risk in a rising interest rate environment 
at december   floating rate loans represented approximately of the commercial portfolio compared to and at december  and although this strategy initially produces a lower yield  we believe that this strategy mitigates interest rate risk by better matching our earning assets to their adjustable rate funding sources 
equity investments equity investments were   and of the company s total portfolio at december    and equity investments are comprised of common stock and warrants  primarily in mci 
the increase in equities over the last two years is primarily a result of the unrealized appreciation recorded on a publicly traded investment 
investment in and loans to media the investments and loans to media represent the company s investment in its taxicab advertising business  including contributed capital  the company s share of accumulated losses  and intercompany loans provided to media for operating capital 
trend in interest expense the company s interest expense is driven by the interest rate payable on its short term credit facilities with banks  other short term notes payable  and fixed rate  long term debentures issued to the sba 
as a result of amendments to the credit facilities and senior secured notes  the company s cost of funds increased during the first nine months of  and will decrease thereafter as long as the company meets the terms and conditions of the amendments 
as noted below  the amendments entered into during to the company s bank loans and senior secured notes involved changes  and in some cases increases  to the interest rates payable thereunder 
in addition  during events of default  the interest rate on the loans is increased by percentage points 
see the table on page for the average cost of funds 
the september  amendments repriced the bank loans to for the company and for mfc  and repriced mfc s senior secured notes to 
in addition to the interest rate charges   has been incurred through december  for attorneys and other professional advisors  most working on behalf of the lenders  and for prepayment penalties and default interest charges  of which  was expensed as part of costs of debt extinguishment in   was expensed as part of interest expense  and  was expensed as part of professional fees 
the balance of  which relates solely to the trust s new line of credit with merrill lynch  will be charged to interest expense over the remaining term of the line of credit 
during the third quarter  the trust closed a  line of credit with merrill lynch for lending on medallion loans  which was priced at libor plus  excluding fees and other costs 
all of the draws on this line were paid to mfc for medallion loans purchased  and were used by mfc to repay higher priced debt with the banks and noteholders 
the company s cost of funds is primarily driven by the rates paid on its various debt instruments and their relative mix  and changes in the levels of average borrowings outstanding 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details on the terms of all debt outstanding 
the company s debentures issued to the sba typically have terms of ten years 

table of contents the company measures its borrowing costs as its aggregate interest expense for all of its interest bearing liabilities divided by the average amount of such liabilities outstanding during the period 
the following table shows the average borrowings and related borrowing costs for   and average balances have declined since the second quarter  primarily reflecting the initial use of the equity proceeds raised during for debt reductions  the sale or participations of loans to other financial institutions  the reductions in the level of loan originations  and the usage of operating cash flow to raise capital for debt reductions and other corporate purposes 
the decline in borrowing costs reflected the trend of declining interest rates in the economy  partially offset by the switch from lower cost commercial paper to higher cost bank debt and related renewal expenses  and additional long term sba debt also at higher rates 
interest expense average balance average of cost of funds december  notes payable to banks sba debentures senior secured notes revolving line of credit total december  notes payable to banks senior secured notes sba debentures commercial paper total december  notes payable to banks commercial paper senior secured notes sba debentures total the company will continue to seek sba funding to the extent it offers attractive rates 
sba financing subjects its recipients to limits on the amount of secured bank debt they may incur 
the company uses sba funding to fund loans that qualify under the small business investment act of sbic and sba regulations 
the company believes that its transition to financing operations primarily with short term libor based secured bank debt has generally decreased its interest expense  but has also increased the company s exposure to the risk of increases in market interest rates  which the company mitigates with certain hedging strategies 
at december  and  short term libor based debt  including commercial paper  constituted of total debt 
taxicab advertising in addition to its finance business  the company also conducts a taxicab rooftop advertising business through media  which began operations in november media s revenue is affected by the number of taxicab rooftop advertising displays currently showing advertisements  and the rate charged customers for those displays 
at december   media had approximately  installed displays in the united states 
the company expects that media will continue to expand its operations by entering new markets on its own or through acquisition of existing taxicab rooftop advertising companies 
although media is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  its results of operations are not consolidated with the company s operations because securities and exchange commission regulations prohibit the consolidation of non investment companies with investment companies 
during and  media s operations were constrained by a very difficult advertising environment compounded by the rapid expansions of tops inventory that occurred during and media began to recognize losses as growth in operating expenses exceeded growth in revenue 
also  a substantial portion of media s revenues in arose from the realization of amounts that had been paid for and deferred from prior periods 
media is actively pursuing new sales opportunities  including expansion and upgrading of the sales force  and has taken steps to reduce operating expenses  including renegotiation of fleet payments for advertising rights to better align ongoing revenues and expenses  and to maximize cash flow from operations 
media s growth prospects are currently constrained by the operating environment and distressed advertising market that resulted from the september  terrorist attacks and a general economic downturn 

table of contents media has developed an operating plan to fund only necessary operations out of available cash flow and to escalate its sales activities to generate new revenues 
although there can be no assurances  media and the company believe that this plan will enable media to weather this downturn in the advertising cycle and maintain operations at existing levels until such times as business returns to historical levels 
also included in was a  tax provision to establish a valuation allowance against the future realization of a deferred tax asset that was recorded in prior periods relating to actual tax payments made for taxable revenue that had not been recorded for financial reporting purposes  of which  was reversed in as a result of changes in the tax laws 
during  primarily as a result of expansion into numerous cities and the lag associated with selling those taxi tops  media began to incur losses for both financial reporting and tax purposes  indicating that this deferred tax asset now represented a receivable or refund from the tax authorities for those taxes previously paid 
however  due to statutory limitations in on media s ability to carry these tax losses back more than two years  and the uncertainties concerning the level of media s taxable income in the future  media determined to reserve against the receivable 
in march  congress passed and the president signed an economic stimulus bill that among its provisions included a carryback provision for five years 
as a result  media carried back an additional  in the first quarter and retains a net operating loss carryforward of  the reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily reflected adjustments made during the second quarter to obligations owed to certain taxi fleet operators which resulted from media s efforts to continue reducing fleet costs so that they were more in line with the reduced levels of revenue 
the increase in amounts due to parent  primarily reflected charges for salaries and benefits and corporate overhead paid by the parent on media s behalf 
in july  media acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of mmj  a taxi advertising operation similar to those operated by media in the us  which has advertising rights on approximately  cabs servicing various cities in japan 
the terms of the agreement provide for an earn out payment to the sellers based on average net income over the next three years 
mmj accounted for approximately of media s consolidated revenue during  compared to during factors affecting net assets factors that affect the company s net assets include net realized gain or loss on investments and change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments 
net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds derived upon sale or foreclosure of a loan or an equity investment and the cost basis of such loan or equity investment 
change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments is the amount  if any  by which the company s estimate of the fair value of its investment portfolio is above or below the previously established fair value or the cost basis of the portfolio 
under the act and the sbia  the company s loan portfolio and other investments must be recorded at fair value 
unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses  but adjusts quarterly the valuation of our loan portfolio to reflect the company s estimate of the current value of the total loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for the company s loans  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of the company 
in determining such fair value  the company and its board of directors takes into consideration factors such as the financial condition of its borrowers and the adequacy of its collateral 
any change in the fair value of portfolio loans or other investments as determined by the company is reflected in net unrealized depreciation or appreciation of investments and affects net increase in net assets resulting from operations but has no impact on net investment income or distributable income

the commercial loan portfolio was  at yearend  compared to  a year ago  a decrease of  or  reflecting decreases in all business lines  especially the sba section a and asset based lending businesses 
in general  the decreases in the loan portfolios were a result of the banks and senior noteholders requiring the company to reduce the level of outstandings in the revolving lines of credit and senior notes

table of contents net unrealized appreciation on investments was  in  compared to depreciation of  in net unrealized appreciation on investments net of media was  compared to depreciation of  a year ago 
unrealized appreciation depreciation arises when the company makes valuation adjustments to the investment portfolio 
when investments are sold or written off  any resulting realized gain loss is grossed up to reflect previously recorded unrealized components 
as a result  movement between periods can appear distorted

the reversal resulted from the change in the tax law allowing for an additional two year carryback of net operating losses 
adjusted for the tax items  media lost  in  compared to a loss of  in the decline in profits in primarily reflected decreased revenue  which continued to be impacted by contract cancellations and other business retrenchments resulting from the terrorist attacks in new york city and a general economic downturn  partially offset by reduced fleet costs which declined at a slower rate than revenue as fleet contracts were renegotiated

the commercial loan portfolio was  at yearend  compared to  for a decrease of  or  reflecting reductions in all commercial lending categories except asset based receivable lending which increased  or 
in general  the decrease in the loan portfolios was a result of the bank lenders requiring the company to reduce the level of outstandings in the revolving lines of credit 
during the first half  the company originated collateral appreciation participation loans collateralized by chicago taxi medallions of  of which  was syndicated to other financial institutions 
in consideration for modifications from its normal taxi medallion lending terms  the company offered loans at higher loan to value ratios and is entitled to earn additional interest income based upon any increase in the value of all  of the collateral 
during  the effect of a general economic downturn began to stress the value of chicago taxi medallions  which accelerated as the year progressed 
as a result the company determined that the previously recorded appreciation was no longer supported by current chicago medallion prices  and therefore adjusted the carrying values down to their original face value of  which represented approximately of its total investment portfolio

asset liability management interest rate sensitivity the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent its interest earning assets consisting of medallion loans and commercial loans reprice on a different basis over time in comparison to its interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of credit facilities with banks  senior secured notes  and subordinated sba debentures 
having interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates  although such an asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates 
abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates 
conversely  having interest earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  although this asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates 
this mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk 
the effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio 
based on past experience  the company anticipates that approximately of the portfolio will mature or be prepaid each year 
the company believes that the average life of its loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates 
borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
conversely  borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment 
a relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from the company s interest rate sensitivity gap 
the interest rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which mature and or reprice within specified intervals of time 
the gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities  and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets 
a relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets

interest rate cap agreements the company seeks to manage the exposure of the portfolio to increases in market interest rates by entering into interest rate cap agreements to hedge a portion of its variable rate debt against increases in interest rates and by incurring fixed rate debt consisting primarily of subordinated sba debentures and private term notes 
we entered into an interest rate cap agreement on a notional amount of  limiting our maximum libor exposure on our revolving credit facility until june  to 
total premiums paid under the interest rate cap agreements have been expensed 
there are no unamortized premiums on the balance sheet as of december  the company will seek to manage interest rate risk by originating adjustable rate loans  by incurring fixed rate indebtedness  by evaluating appropriate derivatives  pursuing securitization opportunities  and by other options consistent with managing interest rate risk 
in addition  the company manages its exposure to increases in market rates of interest by incurring fixed rate indebtedness  such as ten year subordinated sba debentures

the funds paid to mfc by the trust were used to pay down notes payable to banks and senior secured notes 
as a result of these paydowns  the company and mfc were able to negotiate amendments to their existing facilities with the banks and noteholders 
as of march   the company and mfc were current on all debt obligations and in full compliance with all terms and conditions 
the company continues to explore alternative financing options with other lenders for the balance of its debt outstanding under the notes payable to banks and the senior secured notes

the financing agreements are guaranteed by media  secured pro rata by of media s capital stock 
in addition  as is standard with servicing agreements  the mlb line contains a servicer default in the event if mfc fails to satisfy certain financial tests and other requirements  but such failure does not  in and of itself  provide mlb the right to accelerate the maturity of loans 
if mlb obtains the right to replace mfc as the servicer  and so notifies mfc and fails to retract such notice within seven days  the banks or note holders would thereupon obtain the right to replace the company or mfc as servicer for the loans constituting collateral under their agreements

table of contents new financing arrangements we are currently exploring refinancing options which would replace our obligations under the company and mfc loans and the senior secured notes 
in addition to the mlb line  the company is actively pursuing other financing options for individual subsidiaries with alternate financing sources  and is continuing the ongoing program of loan participations and sales to provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth 
interest and principal payments interest and principal payments are paid monthly 
interest on the bank loans is calculated monthly at a rate indexed to the bank s prime rate 
substantially all promissory notes evidencing the company s and mfc s investments  other than those held by the trust  are held by a bank as collateral agent under the agreements 
the company and mfc are required to pay an amendment fee of basis points on the amount of the aggregate commitment for the company 
as noted above  the amendments entered into during to the company s bank loans and senior secured notes involved changes  and in some cases increases  to the interest rates payable thereunder 
in addition  during events of default  the interest rate borne on the lines of credit is based upon a margin over the prime rate rather than libor 
in addition to the interest rate charges  approximately  had been incurred through december  for attorneys and other professional advisors  most working on behalf of the lenders  and for prepayment penalties and default interest charges  of which  was expensed as part of costs of debt extinguishment in   was expensed as part of interest expense in  and  was expensed as part of professional fees

table of contents c interest rate cap agreements on june   mfc entered into an interest rate cap agreement limiting the company s maximum libor exposure on  of mfc s revolving credit facility to until june  premiums paid under interest rate cap agreements were fully expensed by the end of  including   and  expensed in   and there are no unamortized premiums on the balance sheet as of december  the company values its portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by the company s board of directors in accordance with the company s valuation policy 
unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the company must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis 
the company records unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when it believes that an asset has been impaired and full collection is unlikely 
the company records unrealized appreciation on equities if it has a clear indication that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  the company s security has also appreciated in value 
without a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the company s portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments 
the company adjusts the valuation of the portfolio quarterly to reflect the board of directors estimate of the current fair value of each investment in the portfolio 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the company s statement of operations as net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
the company s investment in media  as a wholly owned portfolio investment company  is also subject to quarterly assessments of its fair value 
the company uses media s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value and records the result as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
in addition  the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments 
in addition  if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make loans and investments  our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income 
in periods of sharply rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains 
we use a combination of long term and short term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
our long term fixed rate investments are financed primarily with short term floating rate debt  and to a lesser extent with long term fixed rate debt 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
the company has analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have affected net increase decrease in assets by less than for although management believes that this measure is indicative of the company s sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase decrease in assets 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate 
during the second and third quarters  the company completed an equity offering of  common shares at per share raising over  of additional capital 
the company continues to work with investment banking firms to investigate the viability of a number of other financing options which include  among others  the sale or spin off certain assets or divisions  the development of a securitization conduit program and other independent financing for certain subsidiaries or asset classes 
these financing options would also provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth

the remaining amounts under the approved commitment from the sba may be drawn down through may  upon submission of a request for funding by the company and its subsequent acceptance by the sba 
loan amortization  prepayments  and sales also provide a source of funding for the company 
prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates  medallion loan market rates  economic conditions  and competition 
medallion loan prepayments have slowed since early  initially because of increases  and then stabilization  in the level of interest rates  and more recently because of an increase in the percentage of medallion loans  which are refinanced with the company rather than through other sources of financing 
loan sales are a major focus of the sba section a loan program conducted by bll  which is primarily set up to originate and sell loans 
increases in sba a loan balances in any given period generally reflect timing differences in selling and closing transactions 
furthermore  the company has submitted an application to receive a bank charter for an industrial loan corporation ilc to be headquartered in salt lake city  utah  which if granted  would permit the company to receive deposits insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
the company has held meetings with the relevant regulatory bodies in connection with such an application 
there can be no assurances that such financings will be obtained or that any application related to a bank charter will be approved 
the company believes that its credit facilities with merrill lynch and the sba  and cash flow from operations after distributions to shareholders will be adequate to fund the continuing operations of the company s loan portfolio and advertising business 
media funds its operations through internal cash flow and inter company debt 
media is not a ric and  therefore  is able to retain earnings to finance growth 
media s growth prospects are currently constrained by the operating environment and distressed advertising market that resulted from the september  terrorist attacks and a general economic downturn 
media has developed an operating plan to fund only necessary operations out of available cash flow and intercompany borrowings  and to escalate its sales activities to generate new revenues 
although there can be no assurances  media and the company believe that this plan will enable media to weather this downturn in the advertising cycle and maintain operations at existing levels until such times as business returns to historical levels

at december   the company had  of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet and  recorded on the balance sheet of media  its wholly owned subsidiary  that will be subject to the asset impairment review required by sfas investment considerations interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the interest rate spread we receive on our taxicab medallion and commercial loans 
because we borrow money to finance the origination of loans  our income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we loan funds 
while the loans in our portfolio in most cases bear interest at fixed rates or adjustable rates  we finance a substantial portion of such loans by incurring indebtedness with floating interest rates which adjust at various intervals 
as a result  our debt may adjust to a change in interest rates more quickly than the loans in our portfolio 
in periods of sharply rising interest rates  our costs of funds would increase  which would reduce our portfolio income before net realized and unrealized gains 
accordingly  like most financial services companies  we face the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
although we intend to continue to manage our interest rate risk through asset and liability management  including the use of interest rate caps  general rises in interest rates will tend to reduce our interest rate spread in the short term 
in addition  we rely on our counterparties to perform their obligations under such interest rate caps 

table of contents a decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to more loan prepayments  which could adversely affect our business 
our borrowers generally have the right to prepay their loans upon payment of a fee ranging from to days interest 
a borrower is likely to exercise prepayment rights at a time when the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
in a lower interest rate environment  we will have difficulty re lending prepaid funds at comparable rates  which may reduce the net interest spread we receive 
because we must distribute our income  we have a continuing need for capital 
we have a continuing need for capital to finance our lending activities 
our current sources of capital and liquidity are the following line of credit for medallion lending  loan amortization and prepayments  sales of participations in loans  and fixed rate  long term sba debentures that are issued to or guaranteed by the sba 
as a ric  we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income 
consequently  we historically have primarily relied upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
at december   we had  available under the company s revolving line of credit with merrill lynch and  available under outstanding commitments from the sba 
we may have difficulty raising capital to finance our planned level of lending operations 
the company has substantial debt maturing in although the company has demonstrated an ability to meet significant debt amortization requirements in the last months  and has several refinancing options in progress and under consideration  there can no assurance that additional funding sources to meet amortization requirements or future growth targets will be consummated 
see the additional discussion related to the company s bank loans and note agreements in the liquidity and capital resources section on page lending to small businesses involves a high degree of risk and is highly speculative 
our commercial loan activity has increased in recent years 
lending to small businesses involves a high degree of business and financial risk  which can result in substantial losses and should be considered speculative 
our borrower base consists primarily of small business owners that have limited resources and that are generally unable to achieve financing from traditional sources 
there is generally no publicly available information about these small business owners  and we must rely on the diligence of our employees and agents to obtain information in connection with our credit decisions 
in addition  these small businesses often do not have audited financial statements 
some smaller businesses have narrower product lines and market shares than their competition 
therefore  they may be more vulnerable to customer preferences  market conditions or economic downturns  which may adversely affect the return on  or the recovery of  our investment in these businesses 
our borrowers may default on their loans 
we primarily invest in and lend to companies that may have limited financial resources 
numerous factors may affect a borrower s ability to repay its loan  including the failure to meet its business plan  a downturn in its industry or negative economic conditions  the death  disability or resignation of one or more of the key members of management  or the inability to obtain additional financing from traditional sources 

table of contents deterioration of a borrower s financial condition and prospects may be accompanied by deterioration of the collateral for the loan 
expansion of our portfolio and increases in the proportion of our portfolio consisting of commercial loans could have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the portfolio 
we borrow money  which may increase the risk of investing in our common stock 
we use financial leverage through banks  our long term subordinated sba debentures  and our senior secured notes 
leverage poses certain risks for our stockholders  including the following it may result in higher volatility of both our net asset value and the market price of our common stock  since interest is paid to our creditors before any income is distributed to our stockholders  fluctuations in the interest payable to our creditors may decrease the dividends and distributions to our stockholders  and in the event of a liquidation of the company  our creditors would have claims on our assets superior to the claims of our stockholders 
our failure to remedy certain internal control deficiencies at our bll subsidiary could have an adverse affect on our business operations 
the company s bll subsidiary has been operating under an agreement with the state of connecticut to  among other things  improve bll s liquidity and capital ratios  correct certain operational weaknesses  improve the quality of assets  and increase the level of valuation allowances  the latter of which has already been reflected in these financial statements 
the board of directors of bll has entered into an agreement to address these areas of concern  which are similar to those in previous reports 
there can be no assurance that bll will be able to fully comply with its provisions 
bll represents less than of the profits of the company 
if we are unable to continue to diversify geographically  our business may be adversely affected if the new york taxicab industry continues to experience an economic downturn 
although we are diversifying from the new york city area  a significant portion of our taxicab advertising and loan revenue is derived from new york city taxicabs and medallion loans collateralized by new york city taxicab medallions 
an economic downturn in the new york city taxicab industry could lead to an increase in defaults on our medallion loans and may also adversely affect the operation of our taxicab rooftop advertising business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sufficiently diversify our operations geographically 
the current economic downturn has resulted in certain of our commercial loan customers experiencing declines in business activities  which could lead to difficulties in their servicing of their loans with us 
if the economic downturn continues  the level of delinquencies  defaults  and loan losses in commercial loan portfolio could increase 
the terrorist attack on new york city on september  and the economic downturn have affected our revenues by increasing loan delinquencies and non performing loans  increasing prepayments  stressing collateral value  and decreasing taxi advertising 
although the company believes the estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at december  are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from the estimated amounts recorded in the company s financial statement 
the loss of certain key members of our senior management could adversely affect us 
our success is largely dependent upon the efforts of senior management 
the death  incapacity  or loss of the services of certain of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our operation and financial results 
there can be no assurance that other qualified officers could be hired 
acquisitions may lead to difficulties that could adversely affect our operations 
by their nature  corporate acquisitions entail certain risks  including those relating to undisclosed liabilities  the entry into new markets  and personnel matters 
we may have difficulty integrating the acquired operations or managing problems due to sudden increases in the size of our loan portfolio 
in such instances  we might be required to modify our operating systems and procedures  hire additional staff  obtain and integrate new equipment  and complete other tasks 
table of contents appropriate for the assimilation of new business activities 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful  if and when necessary  in minimizing these inherent risks or in establishing systems and procedures which will enable us to effectively achieve our desired results in respect of any of these or any future acquisitions 
competition from entities with greater resources and less regulatory restrictions may decrease our profitability 
we compete with banks  credit unions  and other finance companies  some of which are sbics  in the origination of taxicab medallion loans and commercial loans 
we also compete with finance subsidiaries of equipment manufacturers 
many of these competitors have greater resources than the company and certain competitors are subject to less restrictive regulations than the company 
as a result  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify and complete financing transactions that will permit us to continue to compete successfully 
our taxicab rooftop advertising business competes with other taxicab rooftop advertisers as well as with all segments of the out of home advertising industry 
we also compete with other types of advertising media  including cable and network television  radio  newspapers  magazines  and direct mail marketing 
certain of these competitors have also entered into the taxicab rooftop advertising business 
many of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company and offer several forms of advertising as well as production facilities 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete with these businesses successfully 
the valuation of our loan portfolio is subjective and we may not be able to recover our estimated value in the event of a foreclosure or sale of a substantial portion of portfolio loans 
under the act  our loan portfolio must be recorded at fair value or marked to market 
unlike other lending institutions  we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  we adjust quarterly the valuation of our portfolio to reflect our estimate of the current realizable value of our loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for this portfolio  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of our management and the approval of our board of directors 
because of the subjectivity of these estimates  there can be no assurance that in the event of a foreclosure or the sale of portfolio loans we would be able to recover the amounts reflected on our balance sheet 
if liquidity constraints required the sale of a substantial portion of the portfolio  such an action may require the sale of certain assets at amounts less than their carrying amounts 
in determining the value of our portfolio  the board of directors may take into consideration various factors such as the financial condition of the borrower and the adequacy of the collateral 
for example  in a period of sustained increases in market interest rates  our board of directors could decrease its valuation of the portfolio if the portfolio consists primarily of fixed rate loans 
our valuation procedures are designed to generate values which approximate the value that would have been established by market forces and are therefore subject to uncertainties and variations from reported results 
considering these factors  we have determined that the fair value of our portfolio is below its cost basis 
at december   our net unrealized depreciation on investments was approximately  based upon current market conditions and current loan to value ratios  our board of directors believes that the net unrealized depreciation of investments is adequate to reflect the fair value of the portfolio 
changes in taxicab industry regulations that result in the issuance of additional medallions could lead to a decrease in the value of our medallion loan collateral 
every city in which we originate medallion loans  and most other major cities in the united states  limits the supply of taxicab medallions 
this regulation results in supply restrictions that support the value of medallions 
actions that loosen these restrictions and result in the issuance of additional medallions into a market could decrease the value of medallions in that market 
if this were to occur  the value of the collateral securing our then outstanding medallion loans in that market could be adversely affected 
we are unable to forecast with any degree of certainty whether any potential increases in the supply of medallions will occur 
in new york city  chicago  boston  and in other markets where we originate medallion loans  taxicab fares are generally set by government agencies 
expenses associated with operating taxicabs are largely unregulated 
as a result  the ability of taxicab operators to recoup increases in expenses is limited in the short term 
escalating expenses can render 
table of contents taxicab operations less profitable  and could cause borrowers to default on loans from the company  and could potentially adversely affect the value of the company s collateral 
a significant portion of our taxicab advertising and loan revenue is derived from loans collateralized by new york city taxicab medallions 
according to new york city taxi and limousine commission data  over the past years new york city taxicab medallions have appreciated in value an average of each year 
however  for sustained periods during that time  taxicab medallions have declined in value 
during the year  the value of new york city taxicab medallions has increased by approximately for individual medallions and for corporate medallions 
our failure to maintain our ric status in and beyond could lead to a substantial reduction in the amount of income distributed to our shareholders 
in january  president bush proposed changes to the federal tax laws which  if enacted in their current form  would eliminate the taxation of dividends paid to shareholders from a corporation s previously taxed income 
assuming we qualify as a ric for or subsequent taxable years  we are unable to predict the effect of such changes if approved by congress upon our common stock 
as noted above  we did not qualify as a ric in if we fail to meet the ric requirements for more than two consecutive years and then seek to requalify as a ric  we would be required to recognize gain to the extent of any unrealized appreciation on our assets unless we make a special election to pay corporate level tax on any such unrealized appreciation recognized during the succeeding year period 
absent such special election  any gain we recognized would be deemed distributed to our stockholders as a taxable distribution 
prior to  we along with some of our subsidiaries qualified as rics under the code 
as rics  we generally were not subject to federal income tax on investment company taxable income which includes  among other things  dividends and interest reduced by deductible expenses distributed to our shareholders 
if we or those of our subsidiaries that were also rics fail to qualify as rics in or beyond  our respective income would become fully taxable and a substantial reduction in the amount of income available for distribution to us and to our shareholders could result 
to qualify as a ric  we must meet certain income  distribution  and diversification requirements 
however  because we use leverage  we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements set forth in the act 
these asset coverage requirements could  under certain circumstances  prohibit us from making distributions that are necessary to maintain our ric status or require that we reduce our leverage 
in addition  the asset coverage and distribution requirements impose significant cash flow management restrictions on us and limit our ability to retain earnings to cover periods of loss  provide for future growth and pay for extraordinary items 
certain of our loans  including the medallion collateral appreciation participation loans  could also be re characterized in a manner that would generate non qualifying income for purposes of the ric rules 
in this event  if such income exceeds the amount permissible  we could fail to satisfy the requirement that a ric derive at least of its gross income from qualifying sources  with the result that we would not meet the requirements of subchapter m for qualification as a ric 
qualification as a ric is made on an annual basis and  although we and some of our subsidiaries qualified as regulated investment companies in the past  no assurance can be given that each will continue to qualify for such treatment in and beyond 
failure to qualify as a ric would subject us to tax on our income and could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
our sbic subsidiaries may be unable to meet the investment company requirements  which could result in the imposition of an entity level tax 
the sbia regulates some of our subsidiaries 
the sbia restricts distributions by a sbic 
our sbic subsidiaries that are also regulated investment companies could be prohibited by sba regulations from making the distributions necessary to qualify as a regulated investment company 
each year  in order to comply with the sba regulations and the regulated investment company distribution requirements  we must request and receive a waiver of the sba s restrictions 
while the current policy of the sba s office of sbic operations is to grant such waivers if the sbic makes certain offsetting adjustments to its paid in capital and surplus accounts  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the sba s policy or that our subsidiaries will have adequate capital to make the required adjustments 
if our subsidiaries are unable to obtain a waiver  compliance with the sba regulations may result in loss of regulated investment company status and a consequent imposition of an entity level tax 

table of contents the internal revenue code s diversification requirements may limit our ability to expand our taxicab rooftop advertising business and our medallion collateral appreciation participation loan business 
we intend to continue to pursue an expansion strategy in our taxicab rooftop advertising business 
we believe that there are growth opportunities in this market 
however  the asset diversification requirements for rics could restrict such expansion 
these requirements provide that if we qualify as a ric in and beyond  not more than of the value of our total assets may be invested in the securities other than us government securities or securities of other rics of any one issuer 
while our investments in ric subsidiaries are not subject to this diversification test so long as these subsidiaries qualify as rics  our investment in media would be subject to this test should we elect to qualify as a ric in and beyond 
at the time of our original investment  media represented approximately of our total assets  which is in compliance with the diversification test 
assuming we had maintained our ric status  the subsequent growth in the value of media by itself would not re trigger the test even if media represented in excess of of our assets 
however  under the ric rules  the test would have to be reapplied in the event that we made a subsequent investment in media  loaned to it or acquired another taxicab rooftop advertising business 
the application of this assets valuation rule to us and our investment in media in light of our loss of ric status in is unclear  although compelling arguments can be made that it should continue to apply if we re qualify as a ric for and beyond 
provided that it does apply  it will be important that we take actions to satisfy the diversification requirement in order to maintain our ric status during those years 
as a result  maintenance of ric status in and beyond could limit our ability to expand our taxicab rooftop advertising business 
it will be our policy to expand our advertising business through internally generated growth 
we expect to consider an acquisition in this area only if we will be able to meet rics diversification requirements 
the fair value of the collateral appreciation participation loan portfolio at december  was  which represented approximately of the total investment portfolio  and the owned medallion portion was  or of total assets 
we will continue to monitor the levels of these asset types in conjunction with the diversification tests  assuming we re qualify for ric status 
our past use of arthur andersen llp as our independent auditors may pose risks to us and also limit your ability to seek potential recoveries from them related to their work 
effective july   the company dismissed its independent auditors  arthur andersen llp andersen  in view of recent developments involving andersen  and engaged pricewaterhousecoopers llp to serve as the company s independent public accountants and to audit the financial statements for the fiscal year ending december  as a public company  we are required to file periodic financial statements with the securities and exchange commission the sec that have been audited or reviewed by an independent accountant 
as our former independent auditors  andersen provided a report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the five fiscal years in the period ended december  sec rules require us to obtain andersen s consent to the inclusion of its audit report in our public filings 
however  andersen was indicted and found guilty of federal obstruction of justice charges  and has informed the company that it is no longer able to provide such consent as a result of the departure from andersen of the former partner and manager responsible for audit report 
under these circumstances  rule a under the securities act of  as amended  permits the company to incorporate the audit report and the audited financial statements without obtaining the consent of andersen 
the sec has recently provided regulatory relief designed to allow public companies to dispense with the requirement that they file a consent of andersen in certain circumstances 
notwithstanding this relief  the inability of andersen to provide either its consent or customary assurance services to us now and in the future could negatively affect our ability to  among other things  access the public capital markets 
any delay or inability to access the public markets as a result of this situation could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we depend on cash flow from our subsidiaries to make dividend payments and other distributions to our shareholders 
we are primarily a holding company and we derive most of our operating income and cash flow from our subsidiaries 
as a result  we rely heavily upon distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to make dividend payments and other distributions to our shareholders 
funds are provided to us by our subsidiaries through 
table of contents dividends and payments on intercompany indebtedness  but there can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will be in a position to continue to make these dividend or debt payments 
we operate in a highly regulated environment 
we are regulated by the sec and the sba 
in addition  changes in the laws or regulations that govern bdcs  rics  or sbics may significantly affect our business 
laws and regulations may be changed from time to time  and the interpretations of the relevant laws and regulations also are subject to change 
any change in the laws or regulations that govern our business could have a material impact on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s business activities contain elements of risk 
the company considers the principal types of risk to be fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio valuations 
the company considers the management of risk essential to conducting its businesses 
accordingly  the company s risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze the company s risks  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
the company values its portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by the company s board of directors in accordance with the company s valuation policy 
unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the company must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis 
the company records unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when it believes that an asset has been impaired and full collection is unlikely 
the company records unrealized appreciation on equities if it has a clear indication that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  the company s security has also appreciated in value 
without a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the company s portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments 
the company adjusts the valuation of the portfolio quarterly to reflect the board of directors estimate of the current fair value of each investment in the portfolio 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the company s statement of operations as net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
the company s investment in media  as a wholly owned portfolio investment company  is also subject to quarterly assessments of its fair value 
the company uses media s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value and records the result as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
in addition  the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments 
in addition  if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make loans and investments  our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income 
in periods of sharply rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains 
we use a combination of long term and short term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
our long term fixed rate investments are financed primarily with short term floating rate debt  and to a lesser extent with long term fixed rate debt 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
the company has analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have affected net increase decrease in assets by less than for although management believes that this measure is indicative of the company s sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet  and other business developments that could affect net increase decrease in assets 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate
