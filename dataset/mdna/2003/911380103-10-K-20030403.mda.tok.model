this paragraph constitutes forward looking information under the reform act 
between january and january  the company executed a series of three year capital lease agreements for call center systems at the company s national distribution center in troy  ohio  bearing interest at rates between and per annum aggregating approximately million 
the company has the option of buying the systems at the end of the term for a nominal price 
as of july   an outstanding loan to a company officer in the principal amount of approximately million  plus accrued interest  was paid by the surrender of  shares of company stock that the officer owned 
the repurchased shares became treasury stock 
the repurchased shares had a value equivalent to the loan based on the closing price on the nasdaq stock market on the preceding trading day 
the exchange was approved in advance by the compensation committee of the board of directors on the morning of july  credit sources import purchases by the company are made in us dollars  are generally financed by trade letters of credit and constituted approximately of total purchases in fiscal united retail group  inc and certain of its subsidiaries collectively  the companies are parties to a financing agreement  dated august   as amended the financing agreement  with the cit group business credit  inc cit 
the financing agreement provides a revolving line of credit for a term ending august  in the aggregate amount of million for the companies  subject to availability of credit as described in the following paragraphs 
the line of credit may be used on a revolving basis by any of the companies to support trade letters of credit and standby letters of credit and to finance loans 
as of february   trade letters of credit for the account of the companies and supported by cit were outstanding in the amount of million and standby letters of credit were outstanding in the amount of million to provide collateral under certain insurance policies maintained by the company 
subject to the following paragraph  the availability of credit within the aggregate million line of credit to any of the companies at any time is the excess of its borrowing base over the sum of x the aggregate outstanding amount of its letters of credit and its revolving loans  if any  and y at cit s option  the sum of i unpaid sales taxes  and ii up to  in total liabilities of the companies under permitted encumbrances as defined in the financing agreement 
the borrowing base  as to any of the companies  is the sum of x a percentage of the book value of its eligible inventory both on hand and unfilled purchase orders financed with letters of credit  ranging from to depending on the season  and y the balance in an account in its name that has been pledged to the lenders a pledged account 
at february   the combined availability of the companies was million  the pledged account had a zero balance  the companies cash on hand was unrestricted  and no loan had been drawn down 
the provisions of the preceding paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding  the companies are required to maintain unused at all times combined availability of at least million 
except for the maintenance of a minimum availability of million and a limit on capital expenditures  the financing agreement does not contain any financial covenants 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company has drawn on the revolving loan facility under the financing agreement to meet its peak working capital requirements and may do so again from time to time 
interest is payable monthly based on a day year at the prime rate or at two percent plus the libor rate on a per annum basis  at the borrower s option 
the line of credit is secured by a security interest in inventory and proceeds and by the balance from time to time in the pledged account 
the financing agreement includes certain restrictive covenants that impose limitations subject to certain exceptions on the companies with respect to  among other things  making certain investments  declaring or paying dividends  making loans  engaging in certain transactions with affiliates  or consolidating  merging or making acquisitions outside the ordinary course of business 
the company uses standby letters of credit to provide collateral under certain insurance policies 
see  incurred but not reported claims for personal injuries and medical benefits 
additional collateral supported by standby letters of credit is likely to be required by the insurers in the future 
the company s obligations to pay customs duties on merchandise imports have been secured by an unsecured surety bond in the amount of million 
the tightening market for surety bonds is likely to make it necessary for the company to support the surety bond with a standby letter of credit in a like amount under the financing agreement 
short term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for domestic merchandise purchases 
trade credit arises from the willingness of the company s domestic vendors to grant extended payment terms for inventory purchases and is generally financed either by the vendor or a third party factor 
the availability of trade credit depends on the company s liquidity in general and the amount of its cash and cash equivalents and availability of unused credit under the financing agreement in particular

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 
 which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

sfas no 
provides three transition methods for companies that adopt sfas no 
s provisions for fair value recognition 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that companies disclose for each period for which a statement of operations is presented an accounting policy footnote that includes i the method of accounting for stock options  ii total stock compensation cost that is recognized in the statement of operations and would have been recognized had sfas no 
been adopted for recognition purposes  and iii pro forma net income and earnings per share that would have been reported had sfas no 
been adopted for recognition purposes 
the company has provided the disclosures required by sfas no 
in the footnotes to the company s consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report 
the company does not currently intend to change its method of accounting for stock options and does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on its financial statements 
critical accounting policies introduction financial statements prepared by companies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are affected by the policies followed by their managements in preparing them 
some accounting policies require difficult  subjective or complex judgments by corporate management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
among the most important accounting policies of the company that involve such management judgments are i using the retail method of accounting for inventory  ii using estimates of incurred but not reported claims for uninsured damages for personal injuries  for self insured workers compensation benefits and for benefits under the company s self insured medical  dental and prescription plans for its associates and future development costs of reported claims ibnr claims and iii determining whether to have a valuation allowance for the company s net deferred tax assets and nol s 
inventory the margins at which the company s inventories can be sold are central to its business 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company utilizes the retail method  under which a cost to price relationship is developed on the basis of original cost as compared to initial retail selling price 
the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting margins are calculated by applying this cost to price relationship to the retail value of inventories 
permanent markdowns  when taken  reduce both the cost and price components of inventory on hand  which maintains the established cost to price relationship 
consequently  the use of the retail inventory method results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market 
inherent in the retail inventory method are management estimates on current and future selling value of the inventory which can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting margins 
the necessity for management estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can produce inventory costs at any point in time that are inexact 
further  deferred markdowns can result in an overstatement of cost under the lower of cost or market principle 
accordingly  at fiscal year end  management conducts a thorough review of inventory on hand and  based on its business judgment  may reduce further the carrying value of inventory by recording a markdown reserve for inventory with sales performance below expectations and or unsold quantities in excess of expectations 
recording a reserve reduces the inventory recorded on the company s balance sheet and is charged to the company s cost of sales 
if inventories  net of reserves  were overestimated at the end of a year  assets and income for that year would be overstated and margins for the beginning of the next year would come in lower 
the opposite would be true if inventories were underestimated 
consistency in inventory valuation practices is one of the company s important accounting objectives 
the company s management believes that the inventory shown on the balance sheets at february  and february  included in the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were properly stated in all material respects subject to unforeseen i changes in consumer spending patterns  consumer preferences and overall economic conditions  ii changes in weather patterns  iii risks associated with the seasonality of the retail industry  iv risks related to consumer acceptance of the company s products  and v war risks 
incurred but not reported claims for personal injuries and medical benefits in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company records a liability for ibnr claims for each fiscal year 
this liability is based on i the number and size of outstanding claims  ii a comparison between the dates paid claims were incurred and the dates they were paid  iii an analysis of the amounts previously paid  iv projections of inflation in medical costs and v advice from time to time from its insurance broker 
the company has insurance policies with coverage for personal injury claims but it remains liable for a self insured retention 
the company is self insured for most workers compensation benefits and for its medical  dental and prescription plans for associates but it has stop loss insurance policies to limit its liability 
if the outcome of claims made with respect to a fiscal year were to exceed the ibnr liability for that year  the liabilities on the balance sheet would have been understated and income would have been overstated for the year in question 
the opposite would be true if the subsequent outcome were less than the recorded ibnr liability 
a consistent approach to estimating liability for ibnr claims reflected in the company s balance sheet is one of the company s important accounting objectives 
the estimates underlying the liability for ibnr claims are matters of judgment on which insurance experts may differ 
the use of different estimates or assumptions would change the amount recorded 
the company s management believes that the liability for ibnr claims reflected in the balance sheets at february  and february  included in the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were fairly stated in all material respects subject to the uncertainties of litigation and the risk of greater than anticipated inflation in medical costs 
valuation allowance in fiscal  the company recorded a million non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets and nol s 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which places primary importance on the company s operating results in the most recent three year period when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
the company s cumulative loss in the most recent three year period  including the net loss reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal  was sufficient to require a full valuation allowance under the provisions of sfas no 
the valuation allowance increased the company s net loss 
the company intends to maintain a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets and nol s until management determines that sufficient positive evidence regarding operating results exists to support reversal of the allowance remaining at that time 
a reversal of the valuation allowance would improve the company s results of operations 
accordingly  whether to continue a valuation allowance is one of the company s important accounting matters 
private label credit cards issued by the bank the company and world financial network national bank the bank are parties to a private label credit card program agreement  dated january  as amended  the credit card program agreement 
under the credit card program agreement the bank issues credit cards to company customers who apply to the bank 
net credit transaction volume with the bank was million in fiscal and million in fiscal customers must meet standards for creditworthiness set by the bank with the approval of the company  provided  however  that the bank shall take any actions required to prevent unsafe and unsound banking practices 
the credit cards issued by the bank are co branded with both the company s avenue r service mark and the bank s name 
the credit cards are used only for merchandise offered by the company 
credit card holders remit payments to the bank  generally by mailing personal checks 
the bank also handles all statement processing  payment processing  cardholder customer service and collections from delinquent cardholders 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company does not include the receivable asset created under the credit card program agreement in the company s accounts receivable on its balance sheets because the company has no interest in the customer accounts or receivables and  depending on the circumstances  might not purchase the accounts from the bank upon the expiration of the contractual term 
in this connection  it should be noted that the credit card program agreement states that i the bank is the sole and exclusive owner of all customer accounts  ii the company has no interest in the customer accounts and iii the bank is the creditor in respect of receivables defined in the credit card program agreement as amounts owed with respect to retail purchases  finance charges  deferred finance charges  other fees and charges for sales tax 
receivables as defined in the credit card program agreement were million at february  and million at february  also  when the credit card program agreement expires  currently scheduled for february   the company shall have the right to purchase the customer accounts from the bank for a price equal to the receivables and the bank shall have the right to require the company to purchase the customer accounts at that price if the company decides to commence a private label credit card program on its own or through another issuer of credit cards 
as to the company s statements of operations  general  administrative and store operating expenses were offset in part by premiums received from the bank of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in premiums received was due primarily to a decrease in bad debt write offs by the bank 
the credit card program premium or discount reflected in general  administrative and store operating expenses is an amount equal to royalties paid to the company by the bank minus costs charged by the bank based on the volume of credit card program processing activities performed by the bank 
royalties are based on program revenues minus receivables written off by the bank and the cost of funds for the program  which  for up to the first million of receivables  means the one year constant maturities treasury cmt rate plus basis points to be reset every three months the published cmt rate was per annum at february  with the cmt rate not to be more than per annum and not to be less than per annum for the purpose of this calculation 
the bank s receivables for the program were less than million at february   but  if they grew larger than that amount  the cost of funds for the excess would be based primarily on the cost of borrowings of a trust for the purpose of securitizing receivables 
store base the company leased stores at february   of which stores were in strip shopping centers  stores were in malls  stores were in downtown shopping districts and stores were in outlet malls 
total retail selling space was million square feet both at february  and a year earlier 
in fiscal  the company opened new stores and closed smaller stores 
in fiscal  the company opened new stores and closed smaller stores 
in each year  the new stores averaged approximately  square feet of retail selling space 
substantially all the construction cost of new stores has been capitalized 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment were related principally to assets in stores and were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company has made commitments to lease and open approximately six new stores during fiscal start up costs will be expensed but are not expected to have a material effect on general  administrative and store operating expenses 
store closings generally take place at lease expiration 
asset write offs and other charges arising from store closings are not expected to be material in fiscal this paragraph constitutes forward looking information under the reform act  which is subject to the uncertainties and other risk factors referred to under the caption future results 
suspension of catalog operations the company mailed avenue catalogs from september to march segment information with respect to the shop home business appears in footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company intends to suspend catalog operations indefinitely 
charges for severance pay to the associates involved will be million and other charges arising from the suspension of catalog operations are not expected to be material 
the company will continue to operate its websites  which will carry merchandise also offered in avenue r retail stores 
corporate acquisition reviews as a matter of routine  the company from time to time conducts due diligence reviews of businesses that are either for sale as a going concern or are in liquidation 
the company would consider making a bid on a suitable corporate acquisition at an opportune price if adequate financing at acceptable rates were available 
expenses associated with the submission of unsuccessful bids to acquire the businesses of competitors were million in fiscal and million in fiscal and were included in general  administrative and store operating expenses 
future results the company cautions that any forward looking statements as such term is defined in the reform act contained in this report or otherwise made by management of the company involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors  many of which may be beyond the company s control 
accordingly  the company s future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward looking statements 
the following factors  among others  could affect the company s actual results and could cause actual results for fiscal to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements included in this report or otherwise made by management war risk  changes in consumer spending patterns  consumer preferences and overall economic conditions  the impact of competition and pricing  changes in weather patterns  risks associated with the seasonality of the retail industry  risks related to consumer acceptance of the company s products and the ability to develop new merchandise  risks associated with the financial performance of the world financial network national bank private label credit card program  increases in interest rates  the ability to retain  hire and train key personnel  risks associated with the ability of the company s manufacturers to deliver products in a timely manner  and political instability and other risks associated with foreign sources of production
