item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  which are included in this report on form k 
certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below and elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
see risk factors that may affect future results in item in this form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates related to sales allowances  chargebacks  rebates  returns and other pricing adjustments  depreciation and amortization and other contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors related to each circumstance 
actual results could differ from those estimates based upon future events  which could include  among other risks  changes in the regulations governing the manner in which we sell our products  changes in the health care environment and managed care consumption patterns 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when the merchandise is shipped to an unrelated third party pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable and  iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
provisions for early payment discounts  and estimates for chargebacks  rebates  damaged product returns  exchanges for expired product are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time such revenues are recognized 
these revenue reductions are established by us as our best estimate at the time of sale based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
these revenue reductions are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance  or as an addition to accrued expenses if the payment is due to a party other than the wholesale or retail customer 
we do not provide any forms of price protection to our wholesale customers and permit product returns only if the product is damaged or if it is returned within six to months of expiration and the customer is committed to accepting replacement product in exchange 
our customers consist principally of financially viable wholesalers  so  revenue is recorded upon sale to the wholesaler  net of estimated provisions 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets we have in the past made acquisitions of products and businesses that include goodwill  license agreements  product rights  and other identifiable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the 
table of contents manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and iii significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we first will perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flow and  if the amount is less than the asset s value  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an impairment review of goodwill on an annual basis 
if we determine through the impairment process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record the impairment charge in our statement of income 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial and income tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the assets and liabilities are realized or settled 
a valuation allowance is established as a reduction of deferred income tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
managed care and medicaid reserves we establish and maintain reserves for amounts payable by us to managed care organizations and state medicaid programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by the respective programs 
the amounts estimated to be paid relating to products sold are recognized as revenue reductions and as additions to accrued expenses at the time of sale based on our best estimate of the expected prescription fill rate to these managed care and state medicaid patients  using historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
research and development costs and accounting for strategic collaborations all research and development costs  including payments related to products under development and research consulting agreements  are expensed as incurred 
we may continue to make up front  non refundable payments to third parties for new technologies and for research and development work that has been completed 
these up front payments may be expensed at the time of payment depending on the nature of the payment made 
our policy on accounting for costs of strategic collaborations determines the timing of our recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or capitalized as an asset 
we are required to form judgments with respect to the commercial status of such products in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
for example  when we acquire certain products in which there is already an anda or nda available and there is net realizable value based on projected sales for these products we capitalize the amount paid as an intangible asset 
in addition  if we acquire product rights that are in the development phase and as to which we have no assurance that the third party is required to perform additional research efforts  we expense such payments 
overview we are a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focusing primarily on developing and marketing drugs in the us for the treatment of dermatological  pediatric and podiatric conditions and the marketing of dermal aesthetic enhancement products in canada 
we believe that annual us pharmaceutical sales in the dermatological  pediatric and podiatric markets exceed billion 
we offer a broad range of drugs addressing various conditions including acne  fungal infections  asthma  rosacea  hyperpigmentation  photoaging  psoriasis  eczema  skin and skin structure infections  seborrheic dermatitis and cosmesis improvement in the texture and appearance of skin 

table of contents we derive a majority of our prescription volume from our core products 
we believe that the prescription volume of our core products and the potential launch of restylane will constitute the majority of our sales for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  any factor adversely affecting our sales related to these products  individually or collectively  could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
several of our core products are subject to generic competition currently or may be in the future 
each of our core products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by regulatory or competitive changes 
as a result of customer buying patterns  a substantial portion of our revenues has been recognized in the last month of each quarter 
we schedule our inventory purchases to meet anticipated customer demand 
as a result  relatively small delays in the receipt of manufactured products by us could result in revenues being deferred or lost 
our operating expenses are based upon anticipated sales levels  and a high percentage of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
consequently  variations in the timing of revenue recognition could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated periodic earnings shortfalls or losses 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain or increase revenues or profitability or avoid losses in any future period 
we estimate customer demand for our products primarily through use of third party syndicated data sources which track prescriptions written by health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies 
these data are extrapolations from information provided only by certain pharmacies  and are estimates of historical demand levels 
we observe trends from these data  and  coupled with certain proprietary information  prepare demand forecasts that are the basis for purchase orders for finished and component inventory from our third party manufacturers and suppliers 
our forecasts may fail to accurately anticipate ultimate customer demand for products 
overestimates of demand may result in excessive inventory production  underestimates may result in inadequate supply of our products in channels of distribution 
we sell our products primarily to major wholesalers and retail pharmacy chains 
consistent with pharmaceutical industry patterns  approximately of our revenues are derived from four major drug wholesale concerns 
while we attempt to estimate inventory levels of our products at our major wholesale customers  using historical prescription information and historical purchase patterns  this process is inherently imprecise 
rarely do wholesale customers provide us complete inventory levels at regional distribution centers  or within their national distribution systems 
we rely wholly upon our wholesale and drug chain customers to effect the distribution allocation of our products 
there can be no assurance that these customers will adequately manage their local and regional inventories to avoid spot outages 
based upon historically consistent purchasing patterns of our major wholesale customers  we believe our estimates of trade inventory levels of our products are reasonable 
we further believe that inventories of our products among wholesale customers  taken as a whole  are similar to those of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  and that our trade practices  which periodically involve volume discounts and early payment discounts  are typical of the industry 
we periodically offer promotions to wholesale and chain drugstore customers to encourage dispensing of our products  consistent with prescriptions written by licensed health care providers 
because many of our products compete in multi source markets  it is important for us to ensure the licensed healthcare providers dispensing instructions are fulfilled with our branded products and are not substituted with a generic product or another therapeutic alternative product which may be contrary to the licensed health care providers recommended prescribed medicis brand 
we believe that a critical component of our brand protection program is maintenance of full product availability at drugstore and wholesale customers 
we believe such availability strongly reduces the probability of local and regional product substitutions  shortages and backorders  which could result in lost sales 
we expect to continue providing favorable terms to wholesale and retail drug chain customers as may be necessary to ensure the fullest possible distribution of our branded products within the pharmaceutical chain of commerce 
we cannot control nor influence significantly the purchasing patterns of our wholesale and retail drug chain customers 
these are highly sophisticated customers that purchase products in a manner consistent with their industry practices and  presumably  based upon their projected demand levels 
purchases by any given customer  during any given period  may be above or below the actual prescription volumes of any of our products during the same period  resulting in fluctuations of product inventory in the distribution channel 

table of contents we plan to spend substantial amounts of capital to continue the acquisition and research and development of pharmaceutical products 
actual expenditures will depend upon our financial condition  as well as the results of clinical testing  delays or changes in government required testing and approval procedures  technological and competitive developments  and strategic marketing decisions 
we may increase our expenditures for research and development and expect that research and development expenditures as a percentage of net revenues will fluctuate from period to period 
we periodically make up front  non refundable payments to third parties for research and development work that has been completed 
if there is no recourse provision against the third party for their failure to perform future services to earn such amounts paid  these up front payments are expensed at the time of payment 
payments made for product rights whereby the product has received regulatory approval for sale are capitalized and amortized over the expected revenue producing period 
to enable us to focus on our core sales and marketing activities  we selectively outsource certain non sales and non marketing functions  such as laboratory research  manufacturing  warehousing and distributing 
as we expand our activities in these areas  we expect to invest additional financial resources in these functions 
the duration of our manufacturing contracts and other agreements with third parties vary in length 
certain transactions in fiscal the following transactions that occurred during fiscal were significant events that affected our results of operations  our cash flows and our financial condition acquisition of dermal aesthetic enhancement products from the q med group on march   we acquired all outstanding shares of ha north american sales ab from q med  a swedish biotechnology medical device company 
ha north american sales ab holds a license for the exclusive us and canadian rights to market  distribute and commercialize the dermal aesthetic enhancement product lines known as restylane  perlane tm and restylane fine lines tm 
the restylane  perlane tm and restylane fine lines tm products are currently being sold in over countries outside the us by q med  but are not yet approved for use in the us the products are approved and are being sold by medicis in canada 
we acquired ha north american sales ab for total consideration of approximately million  of which million was paid upon closing of the transaction  and approximately million is payable upon fda approval of restylane tm  approximately million is payable upon certain cumulative commercial milestones being achieved and approximately million is payable upon fda approval of perlane tm 
as of june   we also incurred approximately million of costs related to the due diligence and execution of the transaction  consisting of approximately million of professional services and approximately million of other costs 
payments and costs related to this acquisition are capitalized as an intangible asset and are amortized over years beginning in march in countries where they are currently marketed  restylane  perlane tm and restylane fine lines tm are injectable  transparent  non animal stabilized hyaluronic acid gels  which require no patient sensitivity tests in advance of product administration 
these transparent  injectable products have varying gel particle sizes which provide physicians in countries where the products are approved with flexibility in treating fine lines and wrinkles  shaping facial contours  correcting deep facial folds and enhancing the appearance and fullness of lips 
in countries where the products are currently marketed  pre packaged  glass syringes provide physicians with various options to treat nasolabial folds  glabellar lines  periorbital lines  perioral lines  vermillion borders  lips  chins  cheeks  smile lines  worry lines and oral commissures 
in the us  the fda regulates these products as medical devices 
a pre market approval application for restylane was filed with the fda in june and is currently under review 
an advisory panel meeting to review this application has been scheduled by the fda for november  we anticipate that requirements for filing applications for perlane tm and restylane fine lines tm will be discussed with the fda following the approval of restylane 
license of products to taro pharmaceutical industries  ltd 
on january   taro pharmaceutical industries ltd 
taro licensed with an option to purchase from us four branded prescription product lines for sale in the us and puerto rico 
the license agreement was effective on 
table of contents january  and extends through june   after which taro may purchase the product lines 
we will receive quarterly license payments from taro during the term of the agreement 
if taro chooses to purchase the product lines at the end of the term of the agreement  the purchase price will be million 
under terms of the agreement  taro is licensing from us the following four brands topicort desoximetasone  a topical corticosteroid used for inflammatory skin diseases  a t s erythromycin  a topical antibiotic used in the treatment of acne  ovide malathion  a pediculicide used in the treatment of head lice  and primsol trimethoprim hci  an antibiotic oral solution for children with acute otitis media  or middle ear infections 
subsequent events on august   we exchanged approximately million in principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes due the old notes for approximately million in principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes due the new notes 
holders of old notes that accepted our exchange offer received  in principal amount of new notes for each  in principal amount of old notes 
the terms of the new notes are similar to the terms of the old notes  but have a different interest rate  conversion rate and maturity date 
holders of old notes that chose to not exchange will continue to be subject to the terms of the old notes 
the new notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  which is payable on june and december of each year  beginning december  we will also pay contingent interest at a rate of per annum during any six month period  with the initial six month period commencing june   if the average trading price of the new notes reaches certain thresholds 
the new notes mature on june  we may redeem some or all of the new notes at any time on or after june   at a redemption price  payable in cash  of of the principal amount of the new notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders of the new notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their new notes on june   and  and upon a change in control  as defined in the indenture governing the new notes  at of the principal amount of the new notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the repurchase  payable in cash 
the new notes are convertible  at the holders option  prior to the maturity date into shares of our class a common stock in the following circumstances during any quarter commencing after september   if the closing price of our class a common stock over a specified number of trading days during the previous quarter is more than of the conversion price of the new notes on the last trading day of the previous quarter 
the notes are initially convertible at a conversion price of per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of new notes  subject to adjustment  if we have called the new notes for redemption  during the five trading day period immediately following any nine consecutive day trading period in which the trading price of the new notes per  principal amount for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our class a common stock on that day multiplied by the number of shares of our class a common stock issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the new notes  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions 
the new notes  which are unsecured  do not contain any restrictions on the payment of dividends  the incurrence of additional indebtedness or the repurchase of our securities and do not contain any financial covenants 
as a result of the exchange  we recognized a loss before tax benefits on the restructuring of debt of approximately million  including the write off of the net book value of the deferred financing fees related to the exchanged portion of the old notes 
this loss will be reflected in our consolidated statement of operations for our first fiscal quarter ended september  on september   we declared a quarter end cash dividend of per issues and outstanding share of common stock payable on october  to our stockholders of record at the close of business on october  results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein

our fiscal year begins on july and ends on june our quarterly results may vary from period to period due to a variety of factors  including fluctuations in demand  expenditures incurred to acquire  license and promote pharmaceutical products  expenditures and timing relating to the acquisition and integration of products or businesses  changes in the prescribing practices of physicians  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  cost increases from third party manufacturers  supply interruptions  the availability and cost of raw materials  the mix of products sold by us  changes in marketing and sales expenditures  market acceptance of our products  competitive pricing pressures  the outcome of disputes relating to trademarks  patents and other rights  general economic and industry conditions that affect customer demand  and our level of research and development activities 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net revenues net revenues during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million during fiscal our net revenues increased during fiscal primarily as a result of growth in sales of the loprox  omnicef  orapred and buphenyl products 
the growth in sales of the loprox product line is the primary cause of the non acne dermatological product segment growth from of total net revenues during fiscal to during fiscal the growth in sales of orapred and buphenyl products was the primary cause of the non dermatological product segment growth from of total net revenues during fiscal to during fiscal the acne and acne related dermatological product segment decreased as a percentage of total net revenues from during fiscal to during fiscal primarily due to a decrease in sales of the plexion product line 
this decrease was primarily due to increased competition as four products entered the market in fiscal 
table of contents gross profit gross profit during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million during fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit increased to during fiscal compared to during fiscal this increase was primarily due to a higher percentage of total sales related to our loprox and orapred products  which have higher gross profit percentages than our other products 
amortization of intangible assets related to products sold are not included in gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million during fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a full fiscal year of costs associated with our ascent pediatrics sales force  including salaries and travel expenses  and increases in personnel costs related to the hiring of additional full time equivalent employees  yearly salary escalations for existing employees  operational expenses related to the acquired restylane family of products and an increase in variable costs commensurate with increased sales volume 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from of total net revenues during fiscal to during fiscal research and development expenses research and development expenses during fiscal increased million  to million from million during fiscal included in fiscal research and development expense is million in milestone payments under a license and development agreement with dow for a patented dermatologic product  and a million milestone payment to aaipharma under an agreement for the development  commercialization and license of a key dermatologic product 
included in fiscal research and development expense is a million payment to aaipharma under that agreement 
absent these charges  research and development expense increased million  to in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  total research and development expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the increased milestone payments incurred during as compared to we expect research and development expenses to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the timing of the achievement of development milestones under license and development agreements  as well as the timing of other development projects and the funds available to support these projects 
in process research and development expense we recorded a million charge to operations for in process research and development during fiscal as part of the allocated purchase price related to the merger with ascent 
there were no in process research and development charges during fiscal the amount allocated to in process research and development was based on an independent valuation of ascent s completed and in process technologies 
during fiscal  we incurred development costs of approximately million related to the acquired in process research and development  and should the projects continue to move toward commercialization  we estimate that future expenditures could approximate million over the next few years 
none of the in process research and development projects had been completed as of june  depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the amortization of expenses associated with the acquisition of the restylane family of products  which began in march operating income operating income during fiscal increased million  to million from million during fiscal operating income during fiscal included milestone payments totaling million related to a research and development collaboration with dow and a million related to a research and development 
table of contents collaboration with aaipharma 
operating income during fiscal included a charge to operations of million for in process research and development relating to the merger with ascent and a million payment to aaipharma for a research and development collaboration 
absent these charges  operating income increased or million from million during fiscal  to million during fiscal  primarily due to an increase in sales volume offset by an increase in operating expenses 
interest income interest income during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million during fiscal  primarily due to an increase in cash available for investment from the issuance of our notes during june and an increase in cash flows from operations 
interest expense interest expense during fiscal increased million  to million from million during fiscal  primarily due to the issuance of our notes during june interest payable on these notes accrues at per annum 
in addition  amortization of deferred financing costs related to the notes is recognized as interest expense over the put period of the notes 
total interest expense recognized during fiscal related to these notes  including the amortization of deferred financing costs  was approximately million 
income tax expense income tax expense during fiscal decreased million  to million from million during fiscal the effective tax rate during fiscal was  as compared to during fiscal this decrease was primarily due to increased tax credits generated by the million in research and development milestone payments made during fiscal  and the million charge that we recorded in fiscal for in process research and development related to the merger with ascent  which was non deductible for tax purposes in fiscal in addition  the effective rate is lower than expected federal and state income tax rates due to approximately million and million of tax exempt interest income in fiscal and  respectively  and contributions to charitable programs that receive favorable tax treatment 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net revenues net revenues during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million during fiscal our net revenues increased during fiscal primarily as a result of growth in sales of the loprox  omnicef  orapred  plexion  triaz and buphenyl products 
fiscal did not include revenue for omnicef and orapred 
non dermatological products increased from of total net revenues in fiscal to of total net revenues in fiscal this increase was due to the addition of orapred during fiscal from the merger with ascent 
gross profit gross profit during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million during fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit increased to during fiscal compared to during fiscal  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to a higher percentage of total sales related to our loprox  omnicef  orapred and plexion products  which enjoy higher gross profit percentages than our other products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal increased  or million  to million from million during fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with the ascent sales force  increases in personnel costs related to the hiring of additional full time equivalent employees  primarily performing selling and marketing functions  and yearly salary escalations for existing employees 
this 
table of contents increase was also due to promotional costs associated with the sampling and advertising of our products  including orapred which was added to our line of products as a result of the merger with ascent 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to during fiscal from during fiscal  primarily due to the assimilation and ramp up of the ascent sales force 
research and development expenses research and development expenses during fiscal decreased  or million  to million from million during fiscal this decrease was primarily due to million paid during fiscal to corixa for a development  commercialization and license agreement for a novel psoriasis immunotherapeutic product  as compared to million paid to aaipharma in june for the development  commercialization and license of a key dermatologic product 
in process research and development expense we recorded a million charge to operations for in process research and development during fiscal as part of the allocated purchase price related to the ascent merger 
the amount allocated to in process research and development was based on an independent valuation of ascent s completed and in process technologies performed by a firm other than our independent auditors and was charged to current operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the million charge was non deductible for tax purposes 
we did not record any charge to operations for in process research and development during fiscal depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses during fiscal decreased  or million  to million from million in fiscal included in amortization expense during fiscal was the amortization of intangible assets related to the omnicef licensing agreement that we entered into with abbott laboratories in may this increase in amortization was offset by a  decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets whose useful lives were reviewed in the first quarter of fiscal and extended from years to years 
these changes in useful lives were based on management s belief that the products related to these intangible assets have longer useful lives than originally estimated 
operating income operating income during fiscal increased million  to million from million during fiscal operating income during fiscal included a charge to operations of million for in process research and development relating to the ascent merger and a million payment to aaipharma for a research and development collaboration 
operating income during fiscal included a million payment to corixa for a research and development collaboration 
interest income interest income during fiscal decreased  or million  to million from million during fiscal  primarily due to the overall decrease in interest rates and a change in our investment mix to non taxable securities 
the increase in our cash available for investment due to the issuance of our contingent convertible senior notes occurred near the end of our fiscal year and therefore did not have a significant effect on fiscal s interest income 

table of contents interest expense interest expense during fiscal increased million  to million from million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to one month of interest expense related to our contingent convertible senior notes that were issued in june  offset by a million reduction related to a product line acquisition obligation that was fully paid during the year 
income tax expense income tax expense during fiscal increased million  to million from million during fiscal the effective tax rate during fiscal was  as compared to during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the million charge that we recorded for in process research and development related to the ascent merger  which is non deductible for tax purposes 
the effective rate is lower than expected federal and state income tax rates due to approximately million of tax exempt interest income in both and  and contributions to charitable programs that receive favorable tax treatment 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal increased million  to million from million during fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the net favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities  partially offset by a decrease in the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options due to a decrease in exercise activity during fiscal as compared to fiscal net cash used in investing activities during fiscal decreased million  to million from million during fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the decreased purchases of available for sale investments during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a significant amount of purchases of available for sale investments at the time of the issuance of our notes during june net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million as compared to cash provided by financing activities of million during fiscal the change is primarily attributable to the proceeds received from the issuance of our million notes  offset by the purchase of million of treasury stock in fiscal we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of million and working capital of million at june   as compared to million and million  respectively  at june  restricted cash and short term investments of million relates to amounts in escrow related to our acquisition from q med of us and canadian rights to the restylane family of products 
the decreases are primarily the result of the purchase of million of treasury stock and the payment of million for the purchase of product rights  net of operating cash generated during fiscal the million of cash used for the purchase of product rights included approximately million related to our acquisition of the restylane family of products  approximately million related to the purchase of an anda for a pediatric prescription product from a third party pharmaceutical company and approximately million related to purchases of other product rights 
in may  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
this program provides for the repurchase of class a common stock at such times as management may determine 
the company has repurchased a total of approximately million toward the million as of june  the timing and amount of any future repurchases will depend upon market conditions and corporate considerations
