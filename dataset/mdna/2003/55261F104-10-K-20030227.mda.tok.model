critical accounting estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to financial statements 
in applying those accounting policies  management of the company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies  assumptions and estimates to be utilized 
certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the company s reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances 
some of the more significant areas in which management of the company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents the amount which  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio  assumptions and judgment are applied to measure expected future cash flows  collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations 
historical loss trends 
table of contents are also considered  as are economic conditions  industry trends  portfolio trends and borrower specific financial data 
changes in the circumstances considered when determining management s estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions  which may result in adjustment of the allowance 
a detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading provision for credit losses 
valuation methodologies management of the company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment  particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued 
quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets  such as trading assets  most investment securities  and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments 
however  for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist  management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items 
examples of these items include capitalized servicing assets  goodwill  core deposit and other intangible assets  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  value ascribed to stock based compensation  estimated residual values of property associated with commercial and consumer leases  and certain derivative and other financial instruments 
these valuations require the use of various assumptions  including  among others  discount rates  rates of return on assets  repayment rates  cash flows  default rates  costs of servicing and liquidation values 
the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results  which could have material positive or negative effects on the company s results of operations 
specific discussion of assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail in notes       and of notes to financial statements 
commitments  contingencies and off balance sheet arrangements information regarding the company s commitments and contingencies  including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation and their potential effects on the company s results of operations  is included in note of notes to financial statements 
in addition  the company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions 
management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate 
should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management s assumptions were inappropriate  the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
information regarding permanent and temporary income tax differences is presented in note of notes to financial statements

 for purposes of testing for impairment of goodwill the company assigned all of its recorded goodwill to the reporting units originally intended to benefit from past business combinations and completed a transitional goodwill impairment test as of january  the company determined that  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 impairment of goodwill was not permitted or required as of january  during the fourth quarter of  the company again performed an impairment test and concluded that no adjustment of the carrying value of goodwill was permitted or required as of that time 
at december  and  the company had goodwill of billion recorded as assets 
core deposit and other intangible assets at december  totaled million  compared with million a year earlier 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
sfas no 
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
pursuant to sfas no 
 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
an entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
those methods must be consistent with the entity s approach to managing risk 
the january  transition adjustment prescribed by sfas no 
was not material to the company s consolidated financial position or its results 
table of contents of operations 
as a result of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
 effective january  hedged residential real estate loans held for sale  commitments to originate loans for sale  and commitments to sell loans are generally recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair market value  rather than at the lower of aggregate cost or fair market value  which was the company s policy prior to january  as a result of recording such items at estimated fair market value  the company recognized approximately million of additional mortgage banking revenues in if not for the required adoption of sfas no 
 such revenues would have generally been recognized in as the residential mortgage loans to which they related were sold

growth in mortgage banking revenues  including the impact of adopting sfas no 
 and higher service charges on deposit accounts also contributed to s increase in noninterest income 
noninterest operating expenses  which exclude merger related expenses and amortization of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets  aggregated million in  up from million in and million in components of noninterest expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature and therefore excluded from the noninterest operating expense totals were amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of million in  million in and million in  amortization of goodwill of million in and million in  and merger related expenses totaling million in and million in a provision for the impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of million and higher costs for salaries  including commissions and incentive compensation  were large contributors to the rise in operating expenses in as compared with expenses related to the acquired operations of keystone and premier significantly contributed to the increase in noninterest operating expense levels in compared with also contributing to 
table of contents s higher expense levels were increased expenses for salaries and employee benefits  including incentive based compensation arrangements  advertising  professional and other services  and amortization of capitalized servicing rights 
the efficiency ratio is a relative measure used by banking institutions that expresses noninterest operating expenses as a percentage of the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and noninterest income 
the efficiency ratio measures how much of a company s revenue is used to pay operating expenses 
the company s efficiency ratio  calculated using the operating expense totals noted above and excluding gains or losses from sales of bank investment securities from noninterest income  was in  improved from in and in cash operating results m t has accounted for substantially all of its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting

net interest income can be impacted by changes in the composition of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as described herein  as well as changes in interest rates and spreads 
the federal reserve took numerous actions throughout to lower the level of interest rates by reducing its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate by basis points 
a further reduction of basis points was initiated in november in general  such actions contributed to a greater decline in short term rates on deposits and borrowings as compared with the decline in yields on loans and other earning assets

net interest free funds contributed 
to net interest margin in  compared with 
in and 
in the decline in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest free funds in and from resulted largely from the impact of lower interest rates on interest bearing liabilities used to value such contribution

management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios 
in managing interest rate risk  the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or  as appropriate  the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of december  was million 
in general  under the terms of these swap agreements  the company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates of interest and makes payments at variable rates 
however  under the terms of million of swaps  the company pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate 
in anticipation of the previously noted issuance of million of fixed rate subordinated notes in october  the company terminated certain interest rate swap agreements during september  including forward starting swap agreements  with an aggregate notional amount of approximately million 
under the terms of the terminated swap agreements  the company would have made fixed rate payments and received variable rate payments 
the termination of these swap agreements  which had been entered into to hedge interest rate risk associated with fixed rate commercial real estate loans  resulted in a net deferred gain of approximately million which is being recognized in income over the designated hedge period of the swaps 
the impact on the company s results of operations for the years ended december   and from amortizing the net deferred gain was not significant 
the amounts of net deferred gain to be recognized in future years is included in note of notes to financial statements 
as of december   million of the company s interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes had been designated as fair value hedges and million had been designated as cash flow hedges 
in a fair value hedge  the fair value of the derivative the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings 
the difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the company s consolidated statement of income 
in a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately 
the amount of hedge ineffectiveness of both fair value and cash flow hedges recognized in and was not material to the company s results of operations 
the estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges was a gain of approximately million at december  compared with a gain of million at december  the fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by unrealized losses on the fair values of the hedged items 
the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges was a loss of approximately million at december   compared with a loss of thousand at december  net of applicable income taxes  such losses were approximately thousand and thousand  respectively  and have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income  net in the company s

the changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items result from the effects of changing interest rates 
prior to the january  adoption of sfas no 
 the fair value of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was not recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the unrecognized fair value associated with such interest rate swap agreements at december  was a pre tax gain of approximately million

the outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government agencies 
the loans were repurchased to reduce servicing costs associated with them  including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors 
in general  the remaining portion of accruing loans past due days or more were either also guaranteed by government agencies or well secured by collateral 
a summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due loan data is presented in the accompanying table factors that influence the company s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers  in general  and  due to the size of the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio  real estate valuations  in particular 
commercial real estate valuations are based upon many assumptions and  as a result  can be highly subjective 
such values can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate  economic conditions  interest rates  and  in many cases  the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property

residential real estate loans past due ninety days or more and accruing interest totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
as already highlighted  a substantial portion of such amounts relate to loans repurchased from gnma which are fully guaranteed by government agencies 
net charge offs of consumer loans and leases were million in  representing

of outstanding consumer loans and leases at december   compared with million or 
at december  and million or 
at december  consumer loans and leases past due days or more and accruing interest totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
during s first quarter  the company began classifying non guaranteed consumer loans and leases past due days or more as nonaccrual 
previously  such loans accrued interest until the loan balances were charged off 
the change in classification did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or its financial condition 
despite the existence of loan collateral in many cases  management conservatively evaluated the collectability of delinquent consumer loans and leases when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective balance sheet date 
management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio  including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category  the current financial condition of specific borrowers  the economic environment in which borrowers operate  the level of delinquent loans and the value of any collateral 
management evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the company s exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the company s allowance for such losses as of each reporting date 
factors also considered by management when performing its assessment  in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above  included  but were not limited to i the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the 
table of contents company s loan portfolio  particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in new york state  in general  and in the new york city metropolitan area  in particular  ii the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city metropolitan area and in central pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country  and iii significant growth in loans to individual consumers  which historically have experienced higher net charge offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types 
the level of the allowance for credit losses is adjusted based on the results of management s analysis 
in ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  the company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases 
the total allowance for credit losses  therefore  includes both specific and inherent base level loss components  as well as inherent unallocated loss components  which are described in the following paragraphs 
the amount of specific loss components in the loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of all nonaccrual commercial and commercial real estate loans 
specific loss components are also established for certain classified commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than  when it is determined that there is a differing risk of loss than otherwise prescribed under the inherent base level loss component calculation 
measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows  collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay 
impaired loans  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended  are evaluated for specific loss components 
except for consumer loans and residential real estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively  the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more 
loans less than days delinquent are deemed to have a minimum delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired 
the inherent base level loss components are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and management s classification of such loans under the company s loan grading system 
the company utilizes a ten point loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits 
loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the company s credit policy 
internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the company s loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards 
loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained 
loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the company s loss estimate for each group of loans and leases 
items considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results  collateral value  financial condition  payment status  and other factors  levels of and trends in portfolio charge offs and recoveries  levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans  changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios  trends in volume and terms of loans  national and local economic conditions and trends  and observed trends and practices in the banking industry 
the specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses 
such allocated portion of the allowance represents management s assessment of near term charge offs and losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed 

table of contents the inherent unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable 
the inherent unallocated allowance includes management s subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things as economic uncertainties  customer  industry and geographic concentrations  and expansion into new products and market areas 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from i comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the company  specifically new york state and central pennsylvania  that resulted in such regions not having experienced the same degree of economic growth in previous years as experienced by much of the rest of the country  ii portfolio concentrations regarding loan type  collateral type and geographic location  in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the new york city metropolitan area and other areas of new york state  iii the effect of expansion into new markets  including market areas entered through acquisitions  iv the introduction of new loan product types  including expansion of automobile loan and leasing activities in recent years  and  v the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance 
commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and  as a result  can be highly subjective 
commercial real estate values in the new york city metropolitan area can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate  economic conditions and interest rates  and  in many cases  the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property 
the tragic events of september  further dampened the economic outlook for the united states  which in and experienced its first significant downturn in many years 
the economies of new york state  and new york city in particular  were specifically damaged by the events of september  economic growth outside of new york city  especially in the industrialized upstate new york markets  continues to lag most other regions of the country 
the unemployment rate in new york state grew in and  rising to at december  slow job growth  coupled with a declining population base  has left the upstate new york region susceptible to credit problems  particularly related to commercial customers 
the central pennsylvania economy has also remained depressed  with employment declining by an average of 
in  compared with a 
increase in however  the region s job losses were roughly half the overall 
average decrease for the united states in the accompanying table presents a comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year ends 
amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year end assessment and using the methodology described herein 
variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in management s estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components 
at december   the amount of allowance allocated to the commercial loan and lease portfolio as a percentage of total loans was lower than a year earlier  largely due to a decrease in outstanding balances of classified loans having estimated inherent losses at those respective year ends 
the increased allocation percentage for real estate loans at december  as compared with december  was the result of higher levels of classified loans in the commercial real estate portfolio 
increased allocation percentages in the commercial loan and real estate loan portfolios from december  to december  reflect weakened economic conditions and an increased level of impaired and other classified loans 
as described in note of notes to financial statements  loans considered impaired pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
increased to million at december  from million at december  such impaired loans totaled million at december  the allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to 
and 
of gross loans outstanding at december  and  respectively 
the slight decrease in the unallocated allowance 
table of contents as a percentage of loans from the year end to december  reflects the modest impact of improving economic conditions at the recent year s end 
the effect of the september  terrorist attacks on the economic outlook at december  and in early diminished later in the year as indications of a gradual economic recovery emerged 
given the company s high concentration of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in new york state  including the upstate new york region  and central pennsylvania  and considering the other factors already discussed herein  management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable 
nevertheless  the company s allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category 
management believes that the allowance for credit losses at december  was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date 
the allowance for credit losses was million or of total loans at december   compared with million or at december  and million or at december  the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at year end  and was  and  respectively

international activities the company s net investment in international assets was million at december  and offshore deposits totaled billion at december  and million at december  liquidity  market risk  and interest rate sensitivity as a financial intermediary the company is exposed to various risks  including liquidity and market risk 
liquidity refers to the company s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demands for loans and deposit withdrawals  to fund operating costs  and to be used for other corporate purposes 
liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ 
core deposits have historically been the most significant funding source for the company and are generated from a large base of consumer  corporate and institutional customers  which over the past several years has become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the company s businesses 
nevertheless  in recent years the company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants  including banks  thrifts  mutual funds  securities dealers and others 
core deposits financed of the company s earning assets at december   compared with and at december  and  respectively 
the company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short term and long term wholesale borrowings  including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  brokered certificates of deposit  and borrowings from the fhlb and others 
m t bank had short term and long term credit facilities with the fhlb aggregating billion at december  outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities 
m t bank and m t bank  na had available lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of new york at december  totaling approximately billion 
the amounts of these lines are dependent upon the balance of loans and securities pledged as collateral 
there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at either december  or as an additional source of funding  in november  the company entered into a million revolving asset backed structured borrowing which is collateralized by approximately million of automobile loans and related assets 
the automobile loans and related assets have been transferred to a special purpose consolidated subsidiary of m t bank 
as existing automobile loans of the subsidiary pay down  monthly proceeds  after payment of certain fees and debt service costs  are used to purchase additional automobile loans to replenish the collateral and maintain the existing borrowing base 
additional information about this borrowing is included in note of notes to financial statements 
m t bank also issued million of fixed rate subordinated capital notes in october that provided liquidity and facilitated the acquisitions of keystone and premier 
informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding are available to the company 
table of contents through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions 
short term federal funds borrowings aggregated billion at december  and in general  these borrowings were unsecured and matured within two days 
should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt rating  or should the availability of short term funding become restricted  the company s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively impacted 
information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the company s short term and long term borrowings is provided in note of notes to financial statements 
in addition to deposits and borrowings  other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets and investment securities  repayments of loans and investment securities  and cash generated from operations  such as fees collected for services 
m t s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses  shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries  which are subject to various regulatory limitations 
dividends from any banking subsidiary to m t are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years 
for purposes of the test  at december  approximately million was available for payment of dividends to m t from banking subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval 
these historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities 
information regarding trust preferred securities is included in note of notes to financial statements 
m t also maintains a million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank  of which there were no borrowings outstanding at december  a similar million line of credit that expired during was entirely available for borrowing at december  in connection with the pending acquisition of allfirst  m t bank expects to issue up to million of subordinated capital notes 
as a result  sufficient liquid assets are expected to be available to fund the cash portion of the consideration to be paid in connection with the acquisition 
on an ongoing basis  management closely monitors the company s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normal course of business 
management does not anticipate engaging in any activities  either currently or in the long term  for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either m t or its subsidiary banks 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of the company s financial instruments 
the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk 
the core banking activities of lending and deposit taking expose the company to interest rate risk  which occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change 
therefore  net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates 
the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk 
management s philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income 
the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities  anticipated prepayments of mortgage related assets and expected maturities of investment securities  loans and deposits 
management supplements the modeling technique described above with analyses of market values of the company s financial instruments 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk 
at december   the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was million 
information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under net interest income lending and funding activities and in note of notes to financial statements 

table of contents the company s asset liability committee  which includes members of senior management  monitors interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments  including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities 
when deemed prudent  management has taken actions  and intends to do so in the future  to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments 
possible actions include  but are not limited to  changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products  modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or entering into additional interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for risk management purposes 
the accompanying table as of december  and displays the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year 
many assumptions were utilized by the company to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income 
the more significant assumptions related to the rate of prepayments of mortgage related assets  cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes  loan and deposit volumes and pricing  and deposit maturities 
the company also assumed gradual changes in rates across repricing categories of and basis points up and down during a twelve month period 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may differ significantly due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates  market conditions  and interest rate differentials spreads between maturity repricing categories  as well as any actions  such as those previously described  which management may take to counter such changes 
in light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process  the amounts presented in the table and changes in such amounts are not considered significant to the company s past or projected net interest income 
in accordance with industry practice  the accompanying table presents cumulative totals of net assets liabilities repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames  as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes 
management believes this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor  as assumed in the table  on the contractual maturity or repricing date 
furthermore  this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the company is likely to implement 
the company engages in limited trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to profit from perceived market opportunities 
financial instruments utilized in trading activities have included forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies and mortgage backed securities  us treasury and other government securities  mortgage backed securities and interest rate contracts  such as swap agreements 
the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions 
the amounts of gross and net trading positions as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the company are subject to a well defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by the asset liability committee  however  as with any non government guaranteed financial instrument  the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counter parties to the company s trading activities 

table of contents the notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading purposes totaled billion at december  and billion at december  the notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading purposes were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet
