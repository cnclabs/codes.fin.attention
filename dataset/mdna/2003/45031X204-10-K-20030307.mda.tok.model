table of contents the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements filed as part of this report 
overview ista pharmaceuticals  inc the company or ista is a development stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new remedies for diseases and conditions of the eye 
since the company s inception  we have devoted our resources primarily to fund research and development programs and late stage product acquisitions 
in december  we announced our strategic plan to transition from a development organization to a fully integrated  specialty pharmaceutical company with a primary focus on ophthalmology by acquiring complementary products  either already marketed or in late stage development 
in order to advance our strategic plan  we are pursuing the development of several products  including  vitrase and istalol  which are in the later stages of review by the fda 
there can be no assurances that either vitrase or istalol will receive final fda approval 
however  we are currently undertaking significant preparations for expansion of its manufacturing and marketing capabilities in the event such approvals are obtained 
if approved by the fda  vitrase will be manufactured for us through our contract manufacturer and marketed by allergan in the united states  while istalol will be manufactured for us through our contract manufacturer and marketed by us in the united states 
we currently have no approved products 
the fda s advisory committee is scheduled to meet on march   to consider our nda for vitrase for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage 
vitrase ovine hyaluronidase is our proprietary drug that we are developing for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage and diabetic retinopathy 
we are also pursuing market approval in the united states of istalol  our new formulation of timolol  to treat glaucoma and developing other products designed to treat hyphema  ocular pain and inflammation 
we believe that if vitrase  istalol  and our other ophthalmic product candidates are successful  we will advance our strategic plan to become a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company 
we have incurred losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit through december  of million 
our losses have resulted primarily from research and development activities  including clinical trials  related general and administrative expenses and a deemed dividend to our preferred shareholders 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to conduct research  development and clinical testing activities  and to seek regulatory approval for our product candidates 
vitrase our current lead product candidate is vitrase  which is derived from highly purified formulations of ovine hyaluronidase 
in march  we announced the preliminary results for our phase iii clinical studies of vitrase 
although the data from the two phase iii studies did not show a statistically significant improvement in the primary surrogate endpoint  further analysis has shown that for a iu dose of vitrase  in both studies  there was a clinically meaningful and statistically significant decrease in the density of vitreous hemorrhage 
a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients with an improvement in best corrected visual acuity at one and two months was also shown  which extended to three month post treatment visits in a clinical study conducted outside north america 
based on these improvements in visual function  and our review and discussions with the food and drug administration fda regarding the data from the two studies  we submitted the clinical section and the chemistry  manufacturing and controls cmc section of the new drug application nda for vitrase to the fda in october the fda accepted those sections of the vitrase nda for review in december  along with the pre clinical pharmacology and toxicology section that was submitted in january we plan to submit the final component of the vitrase nda  concerning manufacturing validation  in the first half of thus  significant research and development efforts and expenses with respect to vitrase have been incurred over the last three years  and we have now completed phase iii clinical trials for vitrase for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage 
we are currently in the process of scaling up our manufacturing operations to support commercialization of vitrase in the event the fda approves all components of our vitrase nda 

table of contents in march  we entered into a collaboration with allergan  inc  under which allergan will be responsible for the marketing  sale and distribution of vitrase in the united states and all international markets except mexico until april and japan 
accordingly  we depend on the success of allergan in commercializing vitrase in these markets 
our principal sources of revenue from this collaboration will be milestone  royalty and profit sharing payments received from allergan 
under the terms of the collaboration  we are responsible for the manufacture of vitrase and for supplying all of allergan s requirements for vitrase 
if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval for vitrase and providing adequate supplies to allergan  and allergan subsequently achieves significant sales of the product  we may receive substantial royalties and other payments from allergan  however  our aggregate manufacturing costs may also increase 
in december  we entered into a collaboration with otsuka pharmaceuticals co 
ltd  a leading japan based international health care and pharmaceuticals company 
under the terms of the collaboration  otsuka will be responsible for all clinical development  regulatory approvals  sales and marketing activities for vitrase in japan  and we will be responsible for supplying all of otsuka s requirements for vitrase 
our principal sources of revenue from this collaboration will be license fees and milestone payments from otsuka 
currently  we rely upon a third party to supply us with ovine hyaluronidase  the active pharmaceutical ingredient in vitrase  and we rely on a contract manufacturer to supply us with the finished vitrase product 
each of these parties is the sole source 
since vitrase has not received fda approval  neither party has past experience in supplying us with commercial quantities of vitrase 
in may  the company acquired substantially all the assets of acsentient  inc the assets include united states marketing rights for a new formulation of timolol  which the company has named istalol  a beta blocking agent for treating glaucoma 
acsentient previously acquired rights to this compound from senju 
the assets acquired from acsentient also included united states product rights to bromfenac  a topical non steroidal anti inflammatory compound for the treatment ocular inflammation  and worldwide marketing rights for caprogel  a novel compound for the treatment of hyphema 
acsentient previously acquired the rights to these two compounds from senju and eastern virginia medical school  respectively 
the company acquired the rights to these three compounds in exchange for  and  shares of the company s common stock valued at  per share 
additionally  the company assumed the liabilities of two milestone payments to senju  and  a milestone payment to the eastern virginia medical school  legal expenses associated with the acquisition  and a patent application fee for caprogel 
as of the date these compounds were acquired  they had not achieved feasibility and there is no significant alternative future use should the company s development efforts prove unsuccessful 
accordingly  the company recorded an acquired in process research and development charge of  in may related to the purchase of these compounds 
the nda for istalol was submitted by senju to the fda in september the nda included data from pre clinical studies conducted in japan  combined with data from a phase i clinical study conducted in the united states and a multi center phase iii clinical study recently completed in the united states 
the company anticipates initiating a phase iii study of bromfenac in the united states in the first half of the company believes that data from this phase iii study  combined with pre clinical and clinical study data from trials previously conducted in japan  will be sufficient for the company to submit an nda for bromfenac in late the company intends to initiate a phase iii study of caprogel in the second half of the company believes that this phase iii study  in combination with a phase iii study of caprogel previously completed in the united states  will support our preparation and submission of an nda in istalol in may  we acquired substantially all of the assets of acsentient  inc the assets include united states marketing rights for a new formulation of timolol  which we have named istalol  a beta blocking agent for treating glaucoma 
acsentient previously acquired rights to this compound from senju pharmaceutical co  ltd  headquartered in osaka  japan 
senju has a diverse product portfolio including ophthalmic  central nervous system  cardiovascular  circulatory  gastro intestinal  respiratory  oncology and dermatological products 
our acquisition of istalol was consistent with our strategic objective of acquiring complementary late stage product candidates 
senju submitted the nda for istalol to the fda in september that nda included data from pre clinical studies conducted in japan  combined with data from a phase i clinical study conducted in the united states and a multi center phase iii clinical study recently completed in the united states 
if the fda approves all components of the istalol nda  we believe that we will be positioned to commercialize istalol in the united states  and to thereby further broaden our specialty ophthalmic pharmaceutical product offerings 
emerging product candidates the assets acquired from acsentient also include united states product rights to bromfenac  a topical non steroidal anti inflammatory compound for the treatment of ocular inflammation  and worldwide marketing rights for caprogel  a novel compound for the treatment of hyphema  or bleeding into the front of the eye 
acsentient had previously acquired the rights to these two compounds from senju and the eastern virginia school of medicine  respectively 
under the terms of the acsentient asset acquisition  we are responsible for payments and other obligations connected with further development of bromfenac and caprogel 
we anticipate initiating a phase iii study of bromfenac in the united states in we believe that the data from this phase iii study  combined with preclinical and clinical study data from trials previously conducted in japan  will be sufficient for us to submit an nda for bromfenac in the first half of we are currently conducting feasibility studies regarding the commercialization of caprogel 
if these studies yield promising results  we intend to initiate a phase iii clinical trial of caprogel in the second half of we believe that this phase iii trial  in combination with a phase iii trial of caprogel previously completed in the united states  would support our preparation and submission of an nda for caprogel in however  our timing for clinical development of caprogel may change based on our assessment  from time to time  of this product candidate s market potential  other product opportunities and our corporate priorities 
we anticipate incurring additional research and development expenses in connection with the further development of bromfenac and caprogel 
if these compounds are approved for sale in the united states  we expect to incur significant additional marketing and sales expenses in establishing and supporting the necessary infrastructure to market and distribute these products in the united states 

table of contents critical accounting policies estimates we recognize revenue consistent with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
amounts received for product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  unless the amounts received are creditable against royalties or we have ongoing performance obligations 
royalty revenue will be recognized upon sale of the related products  provided the royalty amounts are fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
results of operations years ended december   and the following discussion of our results of operations generally reflects our continuing transition from a development stage company to a fully integrated specialty pharmaceuticals company with a primary focus on ophthalmology 
revenue 
revenue of  for reflects the amortization for the period of deferred revenue recorded in december for the million license fee payment made by otsuka in connection with the license for vitrase in japan 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in our research and development expenses to date have consisted primarily of costs associated with the clinical trials of our product candidates  compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  costs for consultants and contract research organizations and costs related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities for vitrase 
we generally classify and separate research and development expenditures into amounts related to preclinical research  clinical development and manufacturing development 
we have not tracked our historical research and development costs by specific project  rather  we track costs by the type of cost incurred 
in  approximately of our research and development expenditures were for preclinical research  approximately was spent on clinical development and approximately was spent on manufacturing development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in changes in our research and development expenses are primarily due to the following clinical development costs overall clinical costs for decreased by million from the decrease in clinical costs in was due to the completion of our phase iii clinical trials for vitrase for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage 
as a result  our overall clinical costs  which include clinical investigator fees  study monitoring costs and data management  decreased in as compared to 
table of contents personnel costs personnel costs  including outside consultant expenses  for increased by million from the increase is primarily attributable to expenses for consultants to assist us with clinical data compilation  review and analysis in preparation of the filing of the nda for vitrase for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage 
direct research costs research costs for increased by million from this increase is principally attributable to the acquisition of three late stage development compounds 
the costs associated with the purchase million were immediately expensed as in process research and development costs because there were no alternative future uses and did not otherwise quality for capitalization 
manufacturing development costs contract manufacturing costs for increased by  from the increase in manufacturing development costs was due to increased activities in connection with the preparations for commercial scale manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in vitrase at biozyme and pre production activities by cardinal health 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses for will be substantially the same that we incurred in  and will be focused primarily on further research and development of vitrase  istalol  bromfenac and caprogel 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the  increase in was primarily attributable to increases in personnel and operating expenses  including expenses associated non cash compensation expense related to stock option grants 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in was primarily attributable to increases in personnel and operating expenses  including expenses associated with the resignation of an officer of the company and non cash compensation expense related to stock option grants 
in the event that vitrase and or istalol are approved by the fda in  our selling  general and administrative expenses will likely increase substantially as compared to to support the commercialization of these product candidates 
stock based compensation 
deferred compensation for stock options granted to employees and directors is the difference between the exercise price and the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock for financial reporting purposes on the date the options were granted 
deferred compensation is included as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  sfas  interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  over the vesting period of the related options  which is generally four years 
compensation for stock options granted to non employees has been determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and emerging issues task force eitf consensus no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services  as the fair value of the equity instrument issued and is periodically re measured as the underlying options vest 
stock option compensation for non employees is recorded as the related services are rendered and the value of compensation is periodically re measured as the underlying options vest 
for the year ended december   we granted stock options to employees to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  equal to fair market value at the time of issuance 
however  in previous years  we had granted stock options to employees with a grant price less than the fair market value at the date of grant 
therefore  we anticipate recording deferred compensation expense of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and respectively  related to these option grants 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and directors  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively  and recorded amortization of   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income was  in   in and  in the decrease in interest income in is primarily attributable to lower average cash balances on hand as compared to the decrease in interest income in over the prior year was primarily attributable to forgiveness of  in accrued interest relating to a loan made to a former company officer  who resigned in we anticipate interest income to be higher in as compared to due to higher average cash balances in our short term investment portfolio 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense was approximately  in   in and  in interest expense incurred during was primarily attributable to our capital leases 
interest expense incurred during was primarily attributable to the interest paid on the financing of our directors and officers insurance premiums 
we had no capital leases during interest incurred during was primarily attributable to the interest paid on the financing of our directors and officers insurance premiums and the amortization of the fair value attributable to the warrants issued in conjunction with the million bridge loan in september excluding the bridge loan  we anticipate interest expense in to be substantially the same as deemed dividend 
during the year ended december   we acquired visionex and accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
at the time of the acquisition  we recorded million of tangible assets acquired and recognized a deemed dividend of million for the excess of the extended value of the shares issued over the net tangible assets acquired 
income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses in  and and consequently did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
at december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which we have fully reserved due to the uncertainty of realization 
our federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
our california tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in we also have federal and california research tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal research tax credits will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
during  a change in ownership  as described in the internal revenue code section  did occur and will limit the ability of the company to utilize the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in the future 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly operating results for each of the last eight quarters in the period ended december  this data has been derived from our unaudited consolidated interim financial statements which  in our opinion  have been prepared on substantially the same basis as the audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this report and include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information for the periods presented 
these unaudited quarterly results should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report

 unaudited revenue costs and expenses research development selling  general administrative total costs expenses loss from operations interest income expense net net loss attributable to common stockholders net loss per common share  basic and diluted research development expenses 
during  our quarterly research and development expenses decreased primarily as a result of the completion of our phase iii clinical trials for vitrase for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage and the deferral of other development activities relating to our other product candidates 
the decrease in activity during was offset by the acquisition costs related to the three late stage development compounds from acsentient during may the acquisition costs were expensed immediately as in process research and development costs 
vitrase development activities included the collection and review of clinical data from study sites around the world  improvements in the manufacturing process of our contract manufacturers and preparations for the submission of an nda to the fda 
selling  general administrative expenses 
during  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of increases in personnel and operating expenses consisting of non cash compensation associated with stock option grants  legal and accounting expenses relating to due diligence efforts for a potential acquisition  and personnel costs associated with the hiring of two additional executive employees 

table of contents interest income expense net 
during the fourth quarter of  our interest expense increased significantly as a result of the amortization of the fair value attributable to the warrants issued in connection with the million bridge loan in september liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and short term investments and working capital of million 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to fund operations for at least the next months 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private sales of our common and preferred stock and the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering 
we received net proceeds of million from the private sale of preferred stock in march  million from our initial public offering in august  million from the private sale of common stock in december  million from a license fee payment in december  million from a bridge loan in september and million from the private sale of common stock in november during we used million of cash for operations principally as a result of the net loss of million partially offset by non cash compensation expense of million 
in  we used million of cash for operations principally as a result of the net loss of million partially offset by the non cash compensation expense of approximately million and million in deferred income 
in  we used million of cash for operations principally as a result of the net loss of million offset by non cash compensation expense of approximately million 
net cash invested totaled  during compared to million provided by investing activities in during  million of cash was invested 
cash used for investing activities in is primarily attributable to the purchase of short term investments 
during  the cash provided by investing activities was from the sale of short term investments to fund our research and development efforts and general operating expenses 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million during compared to million in and million in the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily attributable to the million net proceeds from the issuance of a bridge loan in september and the million net proceeds from the private sale of common stock to certain investors during november  while the cash provided by financing activities in is primarily attributable to the million net proceeds from the private sale of common stock to otsuka during december we continually evaluate new opportunities for late stage or currently marketed complementary product candidates and  if and when appropriate  intend to pursue such opportunities through further product acquisitions and related development activities 
our ability to execute on such opportunities in some circumstances will be dependant upon our ability to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms 
there can be no assurance that funds from these sources will be available when needed or  if available  will be on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
our actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following receiving milestone payments from allergan and otsuka the rate of progress of our research and development programs the results of our clinical trials and requirements to conduct additional clinical trials the time and expense necessary to obtain regulatory approvals activities and payments in connection with the in license or acquisition of products our ability to establish and maintain collaborative relationships sales and marketing activities related to each of istalol  bromfenac and caprogel competitive  technological  market and other developments 
table of contents visionex visionex was established in  under the laws of singapore  to engage in clinical  regulatory and marketing activities 
during  visionex obtained from us the exclusive rights to register  import  market  sell and distribute vitrase and a product called keraform in east asian markets  excluding japan and korea  for which visionex paid us million 
prior to our acquisition of visionex discussed below  investors who owned of ista shares controlled of visionex shares 
on march   we acquired visionex by entering into an agreement with visionex shareholders whereby we issued  shares of our series c preferred stock  convertible into  shares of our common stock  to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of visionex 
we assigned a fair value of per share to the  shares of series c preferred stock issued to effect the acquisition  at which time we recorded a deemed dividend of million to recognize the excess of the value of the shares issued over the net assets acquired 
under singapore tax law  visionex was subject to a withholding tax on a million license that it paid to us in connection with a license to market  sell and distribute our vitrase and corneaplasty products in certain countries in southeast asia 
this withholding tax was waived by the economic development board  or edb  of singapore subject to various conditions  including a commitment that visionex would implement a proposed project to expand its business activities in singapore to the benefit of the local economy 
we substantially wound down visionex operations in july  and the proposed project was never implemented 
based upon a letter we recently received from the edb and our assessment of our obligations with the edb  management does not believe that we will be required to pay any withholding tax or related obligations in connection with the license fee 
however  if we are required to pay this withholding tax  our financial condition will suffer 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interest method is no longer permitted 
sfas no 
also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that is completed after june  sfas no 
no longer permits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
instead  these assets must be reviewed annually or more frequently under certain conditions for impairment in accordance with this statement 
this impairment test uses a fair value approach rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach previously required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the amortization of goodwill included in investments in equity investees will also no longer be recorded upon adoption of the new rules 
intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
upon adoption on january   sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which establishes one accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
upon adoption in january  sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when a liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   however  earlier adoption is permissible 
we do not intend to early adopt sfas and we do not believe adoption will have a material impact on our operations or financial position 

table of contents in november  the eitf reached consensus on eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
the final consensus of eitf will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
additionally  companies will be permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
management is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf will have on its results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
is an amendment to sfas no 
providing alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and also provides additional disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
amendments are effective for financial statements for the company beginning january  the company has currently chosen to not adopt the voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
if the company should choose to adopt such a method  its implementation pursuant to sfas no 
could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments in was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair market value of our interest sensitive financial investments 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our investment income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
historically  and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
we have operated primarily in the united states and have had no sales to date 
accordingly  we have not had any significant exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
visionex s functional currency is the singapore dollar and a portion of visionex s business was conducted in currencies other than the singapore dollar prior to the successful wind down of operations in july as a result  currency fluctuations between the singapore dollar and the currencies in which visionex had done business will cause foreign currency translation gains and losses 
we do not expect our foreign currency translation gains or losses to be material 
we do not currently engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure
