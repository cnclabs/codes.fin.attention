item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and risk factors 
business of the company general we are the world s largest automotive interior systems supplier based on net sales 
our net sales have grown from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december   a compound annual growth rate of 
the major sources of this growth have been new program awards and the implementation of a strategic acquisition plan to capitalize on supplier consolidation and globalization trends in the automotive industry 
our acquisitions account for approximately two thirds of our net sales growth over the past five years 
we supply every major automotive manufacturer in the world  including general motors  ford  daimlerchrysler  bmw  fiat  volkswagen  psa  renault nissan  toyota and subaru 
we have established in house capabilities in all five principal segments of the automotive interior market seat systems  flooring and acoustic systems  door panels  instrument panels and cockpit systems  and overhead systems 
we are also one of the leading global suppliers of automotive electronic and electrical distribution systems 
as a result of these capabilities  we can offer our customers fully integrated automotive interiors  including electronic and electrical distribution systems 
in  we were awarded the first ever total interior integrator program by general motors for the next generation buick lesabre and cadillac deville 
as a total interior integrator  we will work closely with the customer on the design and will be responsible for the engineering  sourcing  manufacturing and delivery of the total automotive interior 
we are focused on delivering high quality automotive interior systems and components to our customers on a global basis 
due to the opportunity for substantial cost savings and improved product quality and consistency  automotive manufacturers have increasingly required their suppliers to manufacture automotive interior systems and components in multiple geographic markets 
in recent years  we have followed our customers and expanded our operations significantly in europe  south america  south africa and the asia pacific rim region 
as a result of our efforts to expand our worldwide operations  our sales outside of the united states and canada have grown from billion in to billion in in particular  our sales in europe have grown from billion in to billion in strategy our principal objectives are to expand our position as a leading global supplier of automotive interior systems and components and to build on our full service capabilities to become the leading integrator of complete automotive interiors 
to this end  our strategy is to continue to capitalize on four significant trends in the automotive industry the increasing emphasis on the automotive interior by automotive manufacturers as they seek to improve customer satisfaction and differentiate their vehicles in the marketplace  the increasing customer demand for fully integrated automotive interior systems  such as door panel  cockpit and overhead systems  the increasing consumer demand for added automotive interior functionality to enhance and enable passenger convenience  on board communication and safety  and the consolidation and globalization of the supply base of automotive manufacturers  resulting in opportunities for greater efficiencies and economies of scale 
the automotive manufacturers strategy is rooted in competitive pressures to improve quality and functionality at a lower cost and to reduce time to market  capital needs  labor costs  overhead and inventory 
these trends have resulted in automotive manufacturers outsourcing complete automotive interior systems as well as complete automotive interiors 
we believe that the criteria for selection of automotive interior systems suppliers is not only cost  quality  technology  delivery and service but increasingly  includes worldwide presence and full service capabilities 

table of contents elements of our strategy include enhance strong relationships with our customers 
we have developed strong relationships with our customers which allow us to identify business opportunities and anticipate customer needs in the early stages of vehicle design 
we believe that working closely with our customers in the early stages of designing and engineering automotive interior systems gives us a competitive advantage in securing new business 
in addition  design capabilities are critical to securing total interior integrator programs 
we work to maintain an excellent reputation with our customers for timely delivery and customer service and for providing world class quality at competitive prices 
in the jd power and associates seat quality report tm  we improved our seat quality for the third straight year  and we continue to rank as the highest quality supplier that serves multiple automotive manufacturers 
in recognition of our efforts  many of our facilities have won awards from the automotive manufacturers 
capitalize on systems and integration opportunities 
the same competitive pressures that led automotive manufacturers to outsource individual automotive interior components to independent suppliers have caused our customers to demand delivery of fully integrated automotive interior systems for new vehicle models 
as automotive manufacturers continue to seek ways to improve quality and reduce costs  we believe customers will increasingly look to independent suppliers to act as total interior integrators  by managing the design  engineering  sourcing  manufacturing and delivery of the total automotive interior 
leverage electronic capabilities 
because electronic and electrical distribution systems are an increasingly important part of automotive interior systems  we seek to use our capabilities in this area to secure new business and to take advantage of integration opportunities 
expand our business with asian automotive manufacturers 
expanding our business relationships with asian automotive manufacturers is an important element of our growth strategy 
certain of our primary north american and european customers have made substantial investments in several asian automotive manufacturers  including general motors investments in daewoo motor  suzuki motor and isuzu motor  ford s investment in mazda  daimlerchrysler s investments in mitsubishi motors and hyundai motor  and renault s investment in nissan 
in addition  we currently have eight strategic joint ventures which serve our largest asian customers  including toyota  honda  nissan  mitsubishi motors  isuzu motor and hyundai motor 
the asian market presents long term growth opportunities as demand for vehicles increases and automotive manufacturers expand production in these markets 
as a result of our strong customer relationships  strategic alliances and full service capabilities  we are well positioned to expand our business with asian automotive manufacturers  both in asia and in north america 
maintain flexible cost structure 
we believe that we have one of the highest variable cost structures in the automotive supplier industry 
by maintaining low fixed costs  we are better able to withstand fluctuations in industry demand as well as changing competitive and macroeconomic conditions 
our variable cost structure is maintained  in part  through ongoing six sigma initiatives throughout the organization as well as initiatives to promote and enhance the sharing of technology  engineering  purchasing and capital investment across customer platforms and restructuring initiatives to align our capacity with changing market conditions 
invest in product technology and design capability 
we will continue to make significant investments in technology and design capability to support our products 
we maintain six advanced technology centers and several customer focused product engineering centers where we design and develop new products and conduct extensive product testing 
we also have state of the art acoustics testing and instrumentation and data analysis capabilities 
we believe that in order to effectively develop total automotive interiors  it is necessary to integrate the engineering  research  design  development and validation of all of the automotive interior systems 
our advanced technology center in southfield  michigan  provides us the ability to integrate engineering  research  design  development and validation capabilities for all five automotive interior systems at one location 
our investments in research and development are consumer driven and customer focused 
we conduct extensive analysis and testing of consumer responses to automotive interior styling and innovations 
because automotive manufacturers increasingly view the vehicle interior as a major selling point to their customers  the focus of our research and development efforts is to identify new interior features that make vehicles safer  more comfortable and more attractive to consumers 
products we conduct our business in three product operating segments seating  interior  and electronic and electrical 
the seating segment includes seat systems and components thereof 
the interior segment includes flooring and acoustic systems  door panels  instrument panels and cockpit systems  overhead systems and other interior products 
the electronic and electrical segment includes electronic and electrical distribution systems  primarily wire harnesses  wireless systems and interior control systems 
net sales for the year ended december  were comprised of the following seating  interior and electronic and electrical 
refer to note  segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional financial information regarding our reportable operating segments 
seating 
the seating business consists of the manufacture  assembly and supply of vehicle seating requirements 
seat systems typically represent approximately to of the cost of the total automotive interior 
we produce seat systems for 
table of contents automobiles and light trucks that are fully assembled and ready for installation 
seat systems are designed to achieve maximum passenger comfort by adding a wide range of manual and power features such as lumbar supports  cushion and back bolsters and leg and thigh supports 
as a result of our product design and product technology strengths  we are a leader in incorporating convenience features and safety improvements into seat designs as well as in developing methods to reduce our customers costs throughout the automotive interior 
for example  our protec tm self aligning head restraint is an advancement in front seat passive safety 
by reducing the space between the occupant s head and the headrest in a rear impact situation through use of a headrest system that moves with the occupant  the difference between the rearward movement of the head and the shoulder area can be shortened  potentially reducing the risk of injury 
in addition  we manufacture an integrated restraint seat system that increases occupant comfort and convenience 
exclusive to lear  this patented seating concept uses an ultra high strength steel tower and a split frame design to improve occupant comfort and convenience 
interior 
the interior business consists of the manufacture  assembly and supply of interior systems and components 
interior products are designed to provide a stylish and comfortable interior for the vehicle occupant as well as a variety of functional and safety features 
flooring and acoustic systems 
we have an extensive and comprehensive portfolio of sonotec tm acoustic products  including flooring systems and dash insulators 
carpet flooring systems  used predominantly in passenger cars and trucks  generally consist of tufted or non woven carpet with a thermoplastic backcoating which  when heated  allows the carpet to be fitted precisely to the interior or trunk compartment of the vehicle 
additional insulation materials are added to provide noise  vibration and harshness resistance 
non carpeted flooring systems  used primarily in commercial and fleet vehicles  offer improved wear and maintenance characteristics 
the dash insulator separates the passenger compartment from the engine compartment and is the primary component for preventing engine noise and heat from entering the passenger compartment 
door panels 
door panels consist of several component parts  which are attached to a substrate by various methods 
specific components include vinyl or cloth covered appliqu s  armrests  radio speaker grilles  map pocket compartments  carpet and sound reducing insulation 
in addition  door systems often incorporate electronic and electrical distribution systems and products  including lock and latch  window glass  window regulators and audio systems as well as wire harnesses for the control of power seats  windows  mirrors and door locks 
instrument panels and cockpit systems 
the instrument panel is a complex system of coverings and foam  plastic and metal parts designed to house various components and act as a safety device for the vehicle occupant 
the cockpit system consists of  among other things  the instrument panel trim pad  structural subsystem  electrical distribution system  climate control  driver control pedals  steering controls and driver and passenger safety systems 
specific components of the cockpit system include instrument cluster gauges  cross car structure  electronic and electrical components  wiring harness  audio system  heating  ventilation and air conditioning module  air distribution ducts  air vents  the steering column and wheel and glove compartment assemblies 
one trend in cockpit systems relates to safety issues in airbag technologies 
through our research and development efforts  we intend to introduce cost effective  integrated  seamless airbag covers  which increase occupant safety as well as provide greater styling flexibility for the automotive manufacturer 
we believe that future trends in the instrument panel and cockpit system segment will continue to focus on safety  leading to the introduction of innovations such as inflatable knee restraints and energy absorbing substructures 
overhead systems 
overhead systems consist of a headliner  lighting  visors  consoles  wiring and electronics as well as all other products located in the interior of the vehicle roof 
headliners consist of a substrate as well as a finished interior layer made of a variety of fabrics and materials 
while headliners are an important contributor to interior aesthetics  they also provide insulation from road noise and can serve as carriers for a variety of other components  such as visors  overhead consoles  grab handles  coat hooks  electrical wiring  speakers  lighting and other electronic electrical products 
as the amount of electronic and electrical content available in vehicles has increased  headliners have emerged as an important carrier of technology since electronic features ranging from garage door openers to lighting systems are often optimally situated in the headliner 
electronic and electrical 
the migration from electrical distribution systems to electronic and electrical distribution systems is facilitating the integration of wiring  electronics and switch control products within the overall electrical architecture of a vehicle 
this migration will reduce the overall system cost and weight and improve reliability and packaging 
this is accomplished by optimizing the overall system architecture and eliminating a portion of the terminals  connectors and wires normally required for a conventional electrical distribution system 
our umbrella technology  intertronics tm  describes our ability to integrate electronic products with automotive interior systems 
this technology is already having an impact on a number of new and next generation products 
for example  our integrated seat 
table of contents adjuster module has two dozen fewer cut circuits and five fewer connectors  weighs a half of a pound less and costs twenty percent less than a traditional seat wiring system 
in addition  our smart junction box combines traditional junction box function with electronic capabilities by incorporating electronic control functions traditionally located elsewhere in the vehicle 
our electronic and electrical products are grouped into three categories electronic and electrical distribution systems 
wire harness assemblies are a collection of terminals  connectors and wires that connect all the various electronic electrical devices in the vehicle to each other and or to a power source 
terminals and connectors are components of wire harnesses and other electronic electrical devices that serve as a connection method between wire harnesses and electronic electrical devices 
fuse boxes are centrally located boxes in the vehicle that contain fuses and or relays for circuit and device protection as well as power distribution 
junction boxes serve as a connection point for multiple wire harnesses 
they may also contain fuses and relays for circuit and device protection 
smart junction boxes are junction boxes with integrated electronic functions  which eliminate interconnections and increase overall system reliability 
certain vehicles may have two or three smart junction boxes linked as a multiplexed buss line 
wireless systems 
the dual range dual function remote keyless entry rke system allows a single rke transmitter button to perform multiple functions depending upon the operator s distance from the vehicle 
the rke and immobilizer module combines the features of a rke receiver and the immobilizer key reader into a single module 
custom key fobs use decorative molding technology to offer a wide variety of options in fob design patterns and colors  including textures  logos  text and translucent and glow in the dark colors 
the passive entry system allows the vehicle operator to unlock the door without using a key or physically activating the rke fob 
the passive entry technology is imbedded in the fob so that a separate device is not required 
interior control systems 
the instrument panel center console control provides a control panel for the entertainment system  accessory switch functions  heating  ventilation and air conditioning 
the multifunction turn signal control consolidates various combinations of hazard lights  headlamps  parking lamps  fog lamps  wiper and washer  cruise control  high low headlamp beams and turn signal functions 
the integrated seat adjuster module combines seat adjustment  power lumbar support  memory function and heated seat into one package 
integrated door controls consolidate the controls for window lift  door lock  power mirror and heated seat 
lear s intertronic tm flip pack seamlessly integrates electrical and interior components and performs all power seat and power door functions from two stacked panels  improving access for drivers 
the mechatronic lighting control module integrates electronic control logic and diagnostics with the headlamp switch 
the intellitire tm monitoring system alerts drivers when tire pressure is low 
infotainment products include audio amplifiers  video modules and the floor mounted mediaconsole tm with a flip up screen that provides dvd and video game viewing for back seat passengers 
manufacturing a description of the manufacturing processes for each of our operating segments is set forth below

raw materials  including resin and chemical products  which are formed and assembled into end products  are obtained from multiple suppliers typically under long term supply agreements 
in addition  we produce carpet at our plant in carlisle  pennsylvania 
smaller facilities are dedicated to specific groups of customers and are strategically located near their production facilities 
electronic and electrical 
electrical distribution systems are networks of wiring and associated control devices that route electrical power and signals throughout the vehicle 
wire harness assemblies consist of raw  coiled wire  which is automatically cut to length and terminated 
individual circuits are assembled together on a jig or table  inserted into connectors and wrapped or taped to form wire harness assemblies 
cell based manufacturing techniques are applied to manufacture products on a just in time basis 
all materials are purchased  with the exception of a portion of the connectors that are produced internally 
certain materials are available from a limited number of suppliers 
supply agreements may last from one year to the life of the related program 
the assembly process is labor intensive  and as a result  production is performed in low labor rate sites in mexico  honduras  the philippines  eastern europe and north africa 

table of contents some of the principal components attached to the wiring harness assemblies that we manufacture include junction boxes  electronic control modules and switches 
junction boxes are manufactured in north america and europe with a proprietary  capital intensive assembly process  utilizing printed circuit boards purchased from selected suppliers 
proprietary processes have been developed to improve the function of these junction boxes in harsh environments  including high temperatures and humidity 
electronic control modules are assembled using high speed surface mount placement equipment in north america and europe 
switches are assembled from electrical  mechanical and decorated plastic parts purchased in the united states  mexico and europe  using a combination of manual and automated assembly and test methods 
while we manufacture internally many of the components that are included within our automotive interior systems  a substantial portion of these components are furnished by independent  tier ii automotive suppliers and other vendors throughout the world 
in certain instances  it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers of products and services that are critical to our business 
with the recent decline in automotive production and substantial and continuing pressures to reduce costs  certain of our suppliers have experienced  or may experience  financial difficulties 
we seek to manage our supplier relationships carefully to minimize any significant disruptions of our operations 
however  adverse developments affecting one or more of our major suppliers  including certain sole source suppliers  could negatively impact our operating results 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors adverse developments affecting one or more of our major suppliers could materially harm our operating results  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the world s largest automotive interior systems supplier based on net sales 
our net sales have grown from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december  the major sources of this growth have been new program awards and the implementation of a strategic acquisition plan to capitalize on supplier consolidation and globalization trends in the automotive industry 
our acquisitions account for approximately two thirds of our net sales growth over the past five years 
our customers are the major automotive manufacturers  including general motors  ford  daimlerchrysler  bmw  fiat  volkswagen  psa  renault nissan  toyota and subaru 
our operations are directly related to automotive vehicle production 
automotive sales and production are cyclical and can be affected by numerous factors  including general economic conditions  labor relations issues and regulatory factors 
in  automotive production increased in north america and declined in western europe as compared to in  automotive production is currently expected to decline approximately in north america and to remain constant in western europe  although actual production levels may be influenced by numerous factors 
in addition to overall automotive vehicle production  our operating results are significantly impacted by the commercial success of the vehicle platforms for which we supply products and the market share of our customers 
general motors and ford and their respective affiliates accounted for approximately of our net sales in a loss of significant business from general motors or ford  or a decrease in business with respect to a significant automobile model  could materially and negatively affect our operating results 
in addition  production levels at fiat  which accounted for approximately of our net sales in  declined approximately in the second half of versus a year earlier  with this trend continuing in the first half of the decline in production levels at fiat adversely affects our operating results 
moreover  our customers require us to reduce costs while at the same time assuming greater responsibility for the design  development  engineering and integration of interior products 
our profitability is dependent on our ability to implement product cost reductions in either our processes or those of our customers or to obtain similar reductions from our suppliers 
our profitability is also dependent on our ability to efficiently control program launch costs as well as changes in the timing of program launches

accordingly  the write off of deferred financing fees related to the billion revolving credit facility  which totaled approximately million million after tax  is reflected as other expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  as of december   we had million outstanding under our primary credit facilities and million committed under outstanding letters of credit  resulting in more than billion of unused availability under our primary credit facilities 
the weighted average interest rates across all currencies as of december  and were and  respectively 
scheduled cash interest payments on our outstanding senior notes are million in each of and and million in borrowings under our primary credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 
therefore  an increase in interest rates would reduce our profitability

table of contents in addition to indebtedness under our primary credit facilities  we had billion of debt  including short term borrowings  outstanding as of december   consisting primarily of billion of senior notes due between and  million accreted value of zero coupon convertible senior notes due and million eur approximately million based on the exchange rate in effect as of december  of senior notes due our primary credit facilities contain operating and financial covenants that  among other things  could limit our ability to obtain additional sources of capital 
the primary credit facilities are guaranteed by certain of our significant subsidiaries and secured by the pledge of all or a portion of the capital stock of certain of our significant subsidiaries 
our senior notes are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our primary credit facilities 
for more information concerning our long term debt  please refer to note  long term debt  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and to the agreements governing our material indebtedness  which have been filed as exhibits to this report 
in august  we redeemed our subordinated notes due the redemption was made at of the aggregate principal amount of the notes 
in may  we redeemed our subordinated notes due the redemption was made at par 
the redemptions were financed through borrowings under our primary credit facilities 
the redemption premium and the write off of deferred financing fees related to the redemption of the subordinated notes due totaled approximately million million after tax  which is reflected as other expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  in accordance with sfas no 
our scheduled maturities of long term debt  including capitalized lease obligations  and our lease commitments under noncancelable operating leases as of december  are shown below in millions thereafter total long term debt maturities operating lease commitments total in addition  we typically enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s life for the fulfillment of our customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle  with terms of up to ten years 
prior to being formally awarded a program  we work closely with our customers in the early stages of designing and engineering a vehicle s interior systems 
the failure to complete the design and engineering work related to a vehicle s interior systems  or to fulfill a customer s contract  could adversely affect our business 
we have in place an abs facility which  prior to november  provided for maximum purchases of adjusted accounts receivable of million 
in november  the abs facility was amended to  among other things  extend the termination date to november and to reduce the maximum purchases of adjusted accounts receivable to million  of which million were purchased as of december  the level of funding utilized under this facility is based on the credit ratings of our major customers as well as the level of aggregate accounts receivable in a specific month 
due to recent declines in the credit ratings of two of these customers  our expected average utilization of the abs facility will be reduced to approximately million in should our major customers experience further reductions in their credit ratings  we may be unable to utilize the abs facility in the future 
should this occur  we would utilize our primary credit facilities to replace the funding currently provided by the abs facility 
during  our utilization of the abs facility versus other available credit facilities resulted in a savings of approximately million 
for more information relating to the abs facility described above  see note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in addition  several of our european subsidiaries factor their accounts receivable with financial institutions 
the amount of such factored receivables without recourse provisions  which is excluded from accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets  was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we cannot provide any assurances that these factoring facilities will be available or utilized in the future 
we believe that cash flows from operations and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated debt service obligations  projected capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
however  our operating cash flows and borrowing availability are subject to the risks and uncertainties identified under overview  forward looking statements and risk factors 
market risk sensitivity in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments in accordance with management s 
table of contents guidelines 
we enter into all hedging transactions for periods consistent with the underlying exposures 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
foreign exchange 
operating results may be impacted by our buying  selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating companies transactional exposure 
we mitigate this risk by entering into forward foreign exchange  futures and option contracts 
the forward foreign exchange contracts are executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy 
the gains and losses relating to the forward foreign exchange contracts are deferred and included in the measurement of the foreign currency transaction subject to the hedge 
any gain or loss incurred related to a forward foreign exchange contract is generally offset by the direct effects of currency movements on the underlying transactions 
our most significant foreign currency transactional exposures relate to canada  the european monetary union and mexico 
we have performed a quantitative analysis of our overall currency rate exposure as of december  the potential adverse earnings impact from a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies for calendar year is approximately million 
the potential earnings impact from a similar strengthening of the euro relative to all other currencies for calendar year is approximately million 
as of december   foreign exchange contracts representing billion of notional amount were outstanding with maturities of less than months 
the fair value of these contracts as of december  was approximately million 
a change in the value of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would result in a million change in market value 
a change in the value of the euro would result in an million change in market value 
there are certain shortcomings inherent to the sensitivity analysis presented 
the analysis assumes that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar or euro 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen causing the earnings impact to increase or decrease depending on the currency and the direction of the rate movement 
in addition to the above transactional exposure  our operating results are impacted by the translation of our foreign operating income into us dollars translation exposure 
we do not enter into foreign currency contracts to mitigate this exposure 
interest rates 
we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt and interest rate swap contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
our exposure to variable interest rates on outstanding floating rate debt instruments indexed to us or european monetary union short term money market rates is partially managed by the use of interest rate swap agreements to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  matching effective and maturity dates to specific debt instruments 
these interest rate derivative contracts are executed with banks that we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies that match the underlying debt instrument 
net interest payments or receipts from interest rate swaps are recorded as adjustments to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income on an accrual basis 
we have performed a quantitative analysis of our overall interest rate exposure as of december  this analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point parallel shift in interest rates at all points of the yield curve 
the potential adverse earnings impact from this hypothetical increase for calendar year is approximately million 
as of december   interest rate swap contracts representing billion of notional amount were outstanding with maturity dates of june through may of these contracts  billion swap variable rate debt for fixed rate debt and billion swap fixed rate debt for variable rate debt 
the fair value of these interest rate swap contracts is subject to changes in value due to changes in interest rates 
the fair value of outstanding contracts as of december  was approximately million 
a basis point parallel increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a million change in the aggregated market value of these instruments 
additional information relating to our outstanding financial instruments is included in note  long term debt  and note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
other matters pension and other postretirement benefit plans approximately of our active workforce is covered by defined benefit pension and or other postretirement benefit plans 
pension benefit plans provide benefits based on plan specific benefit formulas as defined by the applicable plan documents 
postretirement benefit plans generally provide for the continuation of medical benefits for certain eligible employees 
in addition  we have contractual arrangements with certain employees which provide for supplemental retirement benefits 
in 
table of contents general  pension obligations are funded based on legal requirements  tax considerations and local practice 
postretirement obligations are not funded 
as of december  based on a september  measurement date  our projected benefit obligations related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans were million and million  respectively 
these obligations are valued using a weighted average discount rate of for domestic plans and for foreign plans 
the applicable discount rates are determined based on a review of the rates of return for high quality long term bonds  such as the moody s long term aa bond index 
our unfunded pension obligation was million as of december  as compared to million as of december  the increase in the unfunded position is primarily the result of negative asset returns and a reduced discount rate in response to the decline in interest rates 
pension expense was million and million in and  respectively  and is determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions  including expected return on plan assets 
the expected return on plan assets included in the calculation of pension expense was for domestic plans and for foreign plans 
based on an actuarial study and in response to market conditions  the expected return on plan assets for domestic plans was reduced to for the calculation of pension expense 
while we believe that this rate is reasonable at the present time  all actuarial assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjusted when necessary 
adjustments in our actuarial assumptions could negatively impact reported operating results 
we estimate that pension and other postretirement expense will be approximately million and million  respectively 
this estimate is based on a discount rate of and and an expected return on plan assets of and for domestic and foreign plans  respectively 
actual expense will depend on the performance of plan assets  changes in the discount rates and various other factors related to the employees covered by these plans 
decreasing the expected return on plan assets by would have increased our pension expense by approximately million 
decreasing the discount rate by would have increased our pension obligation as of december  by approximately million 
additional information relating to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans is included in note  pension and other postretirement benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
environmental matters we are subject to local  state  federal and foreign laws  regulations and ordinances  which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects and which impose liability for the costs of cleaning up certain damages resulting from past spills  disposal or other releases of hazardous wastes and environmental compliance 
our policy is to comply with all applicable environmental laws and to maintain procedures to ensure compliance 
however  we currently are  have been and in the future may become the subject of formal or informal enforcement actions or procedures 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party at several third party landfill sites and are engaged in the cleanup of hazardous wastes at certain sites owned  leased or operated by us  including several properties acquired in our acquisition of united technologies automotive ut automotive 
certain present and former properties of ut automotive are subject to environmental liabilities which may be significant 
we obtained agreements and indemnities with respect to possible environmental liabilities from united technologies corporation in connection with our acquisition of ut automotive 
while we do not believe that the environmental liabilities associated with our current and former properties will have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated financial position or results of future operations  no assurances can be given in this regard 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and include pre production costs related to long term supply arrangements 
we incur pre production engineering  research and development er d and tooling costs related to the products produced for our customers under long term supply agreements 
we expense all pre production er d costs for which reimbursement is not contractually guaranteed by the customer 
in addition  we expense all pre production tooling costs related to customer owned tools for which reimbursement is not contractually guaranteed by the customer or for which the customer has not provided a noncancelable right to use the tooling 
during and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of pre production er d costs for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by the customer 
in addition  during and  we capitalized 
table of contents million and million  respectively  of pre production tooling costs related to customer owned tools for which reimbursement is contractually guaranteed by the customer or for which the customer has provided a noncancelable right to use 
during  we collected million of cash related to er d and tooling costs previously capitalized 
gains and losses related to er d and tooling projects are reviewed on an aggregated program basis 
net gains on projects are deferred and recognized over the life of the related long term supply agreement 
net losses on projects are recognized as costs are incurred 
a change in the commercial arrangements affecting any of our significant programs that would require us to expense er d or tooling costs that we currently capitalize under emerging issues task force no 
could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations 
goodwill 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this statement  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment analysis 
our initial impairment analysis compared the fair values of each of our reporting units  based on discounted cash flow analyses  to the related net book values 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million million after tax as of january  these charges are reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of tax in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  our annual sfas no 
impairment analysis was completed as of september   and there was no additional impairment 
long lived assets 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  we evaluate the carrying values of our long lived assets whenever circumstances arise which call into question the recoverability of such carrying values 
in  due to operating losses at certain of our locations  we performed an impairment analysis of the related fixed assets 
the results of the impairment analysis indicated that recognition of impairment of the fixed assets was not required 
this potential risk of impairment of the fixed assets will be closely monitored in in addition  we continually evaluate alternatives with respect to underperforming facilities  which may include realignment of our existing manufacturing capacity  plant shutdowns or similar actions 
in  an impairment charge of million was recognized in connection with our related restructuring plan 
see note  restructuring plan  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition and sales commitments 
we recognize revenues as our products are shipped to our customers 
we enter into agreements with our customers to produce products at the beginning of a vehicle s life 
once we enter into such agreements  fulfillment of our customers purchasing requirements is our obligation for the entire production life of the vehicle  with terms of up to ten years 
these agreements generally may be terminated by our customer but not by us at any time 
historically  terminations of these agreements have been minimal 
in certain limited instances  we may be committed under existing agreements to supply products to our customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products 
in such situations  we recognize losses as they are incurred 
in previous years  we recorded loss contract accruals in purchase accounting in conjunction with the lear donnelly acquisition  the ut automotive acquisition  the peregrine acquisition and the delphi acquisition 
these loss contract accruals were not recorded in the historical operating results of lear donnelly  ut automotive  peregrine or delphi 
the losses included in the accrual have not been  and will not be  included in our operating results since the respective acquisition dates 
further  our future operating results will benefit from accruing these contract losses in the related purchase price allocations 
a summary of the loss contract accrual activity related to these acquisitions is shown below in millions accrual at original dec 
 accrual adjustments utilized lear donnelly ut automotive peregrine delphi we utilized million  million and million of the loss contract accruals to offset losses in  and  respectively 
the estimated utilization of the aggregate loss contract accrual is million and million for and  respectively 

table of contents amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
accounting for stock based compensation 
as of december   we accounted for our stock option plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we anticipate adopting the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for the year ending december   under which compensation cost for stock option grants would be determined based on the fair value of the option at the grant date 
sfas no 
would be applied prospectively to all employee awards granted after january   as permitted under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
please refer to recently issued accounting pronouncements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there were no material changes in our methods or policies used to establish estimates and assumptions 
generally  matters subject to estimation and judgment include amounts related to accounts receivable realization  inventory obsolescence  unsettled pricing discussions with customers and suppliers  warranty  pension and other postretirement plan assumptions  plant consolidation and reorganization reserves  self insurance accruals  asset valuation reserves and accruals related to litigation  environmental remediation costs and income taxes 
while management does not believe that the ultimate settlement of any such assets or liabilities will materially affect our financial position or results of future operations  actual results may differ from estimates provided 
backlog as of december   we had an incremental sales backlog of million for orders to be executed in our current five year sales backlog exceeds our prior year five year sales backlog by approximately million  with most of the increase in and  although various factors could influence the timing and realization of new sales 
we typically enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a vehicle s life for the fulfillment of our customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle 
these agreements generally may be terminated by the customer but not by us at any time 
therefore  our backlog data does not reflect firm orders or firm commitments 
our sales backlog reflects the expected aggregate sales increase of i formally awarded new programs  ii targeted programs on which we believe there is a substantial likelihood of award  iii lost and canceled programs  iv estimates regarding customer mandated changes in selling prices and v estimates of expected growth in vehicle content 
changes in any of these components may significantly impact our backlog 
in addition  our backlog may be impacted by various assumptions imbedded in the calculation  including  but not limited to  vehicle production levels on new  replacement and targeted programs  foreign currency exchange rates and the timing of major program launches 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which is effective for all exit or disposal activities initiated after december  this statement requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
such costs include one time employee termination costs  contract cancellation provisions and other costs typically associated with a corporate restructuring or other exit or disposal activities 
we do not expect the effects of adoption to be significant 
accounting for stock based compensation 
the fasb has issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which is effective for fiscal years ending after december  this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  by providing alternative methods of transition for the adoption of the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation and by requiring additional disclosures 
the alternative methods under sfas no 
include the prospective method  the modified prospective method and the retroactive restatement method 
we anticipate adopting the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation for the year ending december  using the prospective method 
as a result  the fair value based method of accounting would be applied to stock based compensation grants issued after december  the resulting compensation costs would be amortized over the related vesting period 
in  the adoption of sfas no 
would reduce net income per share by approximately per share  assuming a similar mid year option grant  consistent with prior years 
accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees 
the fasb has issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  the provisions of which apply to guarantees issued or modified after december  this interpretation requires guarantors to record a liability for the fair value of certain guarantees at their inception 
we do not expect the effects of adoption to be significant 
variable interest entities 
the fasb has issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  the provisions of which apply immediately to any variable interest entity created after january  and apply in the first interim period beginning after june  to any variable interest entity created prior to february  this interpretation requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity by its primary beneficiary and may require the consolidation of a portion of a variable interest entity s assets or liabilities under certain circumstances 
we do not expect the effects of adoption to be significant

important factors  risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in our forward looking statements include  but are not limited to general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate  fluctuation in worldwide or regional automotive and light truck production  financial or market declines of our customers  labor disputes involving us or one or more of our customers or that could otherwise affect our operations  changes in practices and or policies of our significant customers toward outsourcing automotive systems and components  our success in achieving cost reductions that offset or exceed customer mandated selling price reductions  liabilities arising from legal proceedings to which we are or may become a party or claims against us or our products  increases in our warranty costs  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  increases in interest rates  changes in technology and technological risks  adverse changes in economic conditions or political instability in the jurisdictions in which we operate  competitive conditions impacting our key customers  increases in energy or raw material costs  raw materials shortages  the occurrence of war  terrorist attacks or other adverse geopolitical events  and other risks  described below in risk factors and from time to time in our other sec filings 
we do not assume any obligation to update any of these forward looking statements 
risk factors a decline in automotive sales would reduce our sales and could harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
our operations are directly related to automotive vehicle production 
automotive sales and production are cyclical and can be affected by the strength of a country s general economy 
in addition  automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues  regulatory requirements  trade agreements and other factors 
automotive production in north america and western europe has declined from million in to million in and is expected to decline to million in numerous factors beyond our control could lead to a further decline 
our restructuring actions were intended to align our capacity with lower production levels 
however  deterioration beyond the expected production levels could have a negative impact on our sales  net income and other results of operations 
the loss of business from a major customer could reduce our sales and harm our profitability  which could make it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
general motors and ford and their respective affiliates  the two largest automotive manufacturers in the world  together accounted for approximately of our net sales in a loss of significant business from general motors or ford could be harmful to our business and our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and leading to a decline in the value of our common stock 
in addition  production levels at fiat  our fifth largest customer in  declined approximately in the second half of  versus a year earlier  with the trend continuing in the first half of the decline in production levels at fiat adversely affects our operating results 
in addition  several of the platforms of other automotive manufacturers for which we are a major supplier have recently experienced significant decreases in production volumes 
the discontinuation of  or the loss of business with respect to  a particular vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier would reduce our sales and harm our profitability  which could make it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
although we have purchase orders from many of our customers  these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer s annual requirements for a particular model and assembly plant  renewable on a year to year basis  rather than 
table of contents for the purchase of a specific quantity of products 
the discontinuation of  or loss of business with respect to  an automobile model for which we are a significant supplier would reduce our sales and profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and leading to a decline in the value of our common stock 
our substantial international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
as a result of our global presence  a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
in addition  we have manufacturing and distribution facilities in many foreign countries  including countries in asia  eastern and western europe and central and south america 
international operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad  including exposure to local economic conditions  expropriation and nationalization  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls  withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  investment restrictions or requirements  export and import restrictions  and increase in working capital requirements related to long supply chains 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable but may have a material adverse effect on our business and our profitability  which would make it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
a significant labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or that could otherwise affect our operations could materially reduce our sales and harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
approximately of our employees  and a substantial number of the employees of most of our customers and suppliers  are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of collective bargaining agreements 
virtually all of our unionized facilities in the united states and canada have a separate agreement with the union that represents the workers at such facilities  with each such agreement having an expiration date that is independent of other collective bargaining agreements 
collective bargaining agreements covering approximately of our unionized workforce of approximately  employees are scheduled to expire during a labor dispute involving us or any of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations or the inability by us or any of our customers or suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement covering a large number of employees upon its expiration  could materially reduce our sales and harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely impact our business and profitability 
the collective bargaining agreements covering the united states unionized workforce of our three largest customers  general motors  ford and daimlerchrysler  are scheduled to expire in september adverse developments affecting one or more of our major suppliers could materially harm our operating results  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
we obtain components and other products and services from numerous tier ii automotive suppliers and other vendors throughout the world 
in certain instances  it would be difficult and expensive for us to change suppliers of products and services critical to our business 
some of our suppliers are financially distressed or may become financially distressed 
any significant disruption in our supplier relationships  including certain relationships with sole source suppliers  could materially harm our operating results  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
a significant product liability lawsuit  warranty claim or product recall involving us with one of our major customers could materially harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and such failure results in  or is alleged to result in  bodily injury and or property damage or other losses  we may be subject to product liability lawsuits  warranty claims and product recalls 
in addition  as we are a party to warranty sharing agreements with certain of our customers  product liability and 
table of contents warranty claims involving one of our customers could also materially harm our profitability  thereby making it more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness and lead to a decline in the value of our common stock 
we depend upon cash from our subsidiaries and  therefore  if we do not receive dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries  it will be more difficult for us to make payments under our indebtedness 
a substantial portion of our revenue and operating income is generated by our wholly owned subsidiaries 
accordingly  we will be dependent on the earnings and cash flow of  and dividends and distributions or advances from  our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt service obligations 
our obligations under our primary credit facilities and senior notes are currently guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries  but such guarantees may be released under certain circumstances
