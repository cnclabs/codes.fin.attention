item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general our objective is to become the preferred supplier of industrial products for companies throughout the united states 
we intend to increase sales to existing customers and diversify our customer base by expanding next day ground delivery into new markets  targeting the circulation of our master catalog and our direct mail campaign  developing government and national account programs  increasing the number of product lines and skus offered including generic and imported products  continually developing technological innovations employing modern technologies to reduce our customers costs and utilizing extensive e commerce capabilities  making it even easier and more appealing to do business with msc  maintaining excellent customer support service  and increasing the productivity of our direct sales force 
in the future  we intend to take advantage of the additional products offered and our expanded distribution capabilities by further increasing our direct marketing efforts  however  the costs associated with our direct marketing program will be incurred substantially in advance of increased sales and may negatively impact operating margins in the short term 
such costs are expected to be offset  in part  by increases in vendor funded co op payments which will offset a portion of the catalog and mailing expenses 
there can be no assurance that continued expansion of our direct mail marketing program will result in new customers or an increase in sales from existing customers

we have generally experienced slightly lower sales volumes during the summer months  and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
as a result  net income in the fourth fiscal quarter is historically somewhat lower than in the third fiscal quarter  due largely to the continuation of our fixed costs during slower sales periods

management s discussion and analysis of critical accounting policies and estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  goodwill  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates

the company sells its products primarily to end users 
the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and collateral is not required 
receivables are generally due within days 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with customers and their credit worthiness 
initially  the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience 
this estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy  etc  or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable 
the company maintains the majority of its cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions 
deposits held with banks may exceed insurance limits 
these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and therefore bear minimal risk 
inventory valuation inventories consist of merchandise held for resale and are stated at the lower of weighted average cost using the first in  first out method or market 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a quarterly basis 
slow moving inventory  obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage is written down  using historical data and reasonable assumptions  to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory
