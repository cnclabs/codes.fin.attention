item business the company green mountain power corporation the company or gmp is a public utility operating company engaged in supplying electrical energy in the state of vermont state or vermont in a territory with approximately one quarter of the state s population 
we serve approximately  customers 
the company was incorporated under the laws of the state on april  our sources of revenue for the year ended december  were as follows percent from residential customers  percent from small commercial and industrial customers  percent from large commercial and industrial customers  percent from sales to other utilities  and percent from other sources 
see the annual report and md and a for further information about revenues 
during  our energy resources for retail and wholesale sales of electricity  excluding sales made pursuant to the contract with morgan stanley capital group  inc ms discussed under md and a power contract commitments  were obtained as follows percent from hydroelectric sources percent hydro quebec  percent company owned  percent small power producers  and percent new york power authority nypa  percent from a nuclear generating source the entergy nuclear plant described below  percent from wood  percent from natural gas  percent from oil  and percent from wind 
the remaining percent was purchased on a short term basis from other utilities through the independent system operator of new england iso or iso new england  formerly the new england power pool nepool 
in  we purchased percent of our energy resources to satisfy our retail and wholesale sales of electricity  including energy purchased from vermont yankee nuclear power corporation vermont yankee or vy and under other long term purchase arrangements  but excluding purchases for resale under the ms contract 
see note k of notes 
a major source of the company s power supply is our entitlement to a share of the power generated by the megawatt mw nuclear generating plant owned and operated by entergy vermont yankee nuclear corporation entergy 
we have an percent equity interest in vermont yankee  which has a long term power supply contract with entergy  that entitles us to percent of plant output through for further information concerning vermont yankee  see power resources vermont yankee 
the company participates in nepool  a regional bulk power transmission organization established to assure reliable and economical power supply in the northeast 
the iso was created to manage the operations of nepool in the iso works as a clearinghouse for purchasers and sellers of electricity in the deregulated wholesale energy markets 
sellers place bids for the sale of their generation or purchased power resources and if demand is high enough the output from those resources is sold 
we must purchase additional electricity to meet customer demand during periods of high usage and to replace energy repurchased by hydro quebec under an arrangement negotiated in our costs to serve demand during such high usage periods such as warmer than normal temperatures in summer months and to replace such energy repurchases by hydro quebec rose substantially after the market opened to competitive bidding on may  our principal service territory is an area roughly miles in width extending miles across north central vermont between lake champlain on the west and the connecticut river on the east 
included in this territory are the cities and towns of montpelier  barre  south burlington  vergennes  williston  shelburne  and winooski  as well as the village of essex junction and a number of smaller communities 
we also distribute electricity in four separate areas located in southern and southeastern vermont that are interconnected with our principal service area through the transmission lines of vermont electric power company  inc velco and others 
included in these areas are the communities of vernon where the entergy nuclear plant is located  bellows falls  white river junction  wilder  wilmington and dover 
the company s right to distribute electrical service in its service territory is the utility s most important asset 
we supply at wholesale a portion of the power requirements of several municipalities and cooperatives in vermont 
we are obligated to meet the changing electrical requirements of these wholesale customers  in contrast to our obligation to other wholesale customers  which is limited to specified amounts of capacity and energy established by contract 
major business activities in our service areas include computer assembly and components manufacturing and other electronics manufacturing  software development  granite fabrication  service enterprises such as government  insurance  regional retail shopping  tourism particularly fall and winter recreation  and dairy and general farming

state and federal regulation general 
the company is subject to the regulatory authority of the vermont public service board vpsb  which extends to retail rates  services and facilities  securities issues and various other matters 
the separate vermont department of public service the department  created by statute in  is responsible for development of energy supply plans for the state of vermont  purchases of power as an agent for the state and other general regulatory matters 
the vpsb principally conducts quasi judicial proceedings  such as rate setting 
the department  through a director for public advocacy  is entitled to participate as a litigant in such proceedings and regularly does so 
political or social organizations that represent certain classes of customers  neighbors of our properties  or other persons or entities may petition the vpsb to be granted intervener status in such proceedings 
our rate tariffs are uniform throughout our service area 
we have entered into a number of jobs incentive agreements  providing for reduced capacity charges to large customers applicable only to new load 
we have an economic development agreement with international business machines corporation ibm that provides for contractually established charges  rather than tariff rates  for incremental loads 
see item md and a results of operations operating revenues and mwh sales 
our wholesale rate on sales to two wholesale customers is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
revenues from sales to these customers were less than percent of our operating revenues for we provide transmission service to twelve customers within the state under rates regulated by the ferc  revenues for such services amounted to less than percent of our operating revenues for on july   the ferc approved our open access transmission tariff  and on august  we filed our compliance refund report 
in accordance with ferc order  we have functionally separated our transmission operations and filed with the ferc a code of conduct for our transmission operations 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effects or loss of wholesale customers due to ferc order our open access tariff could reduce the amount of capacity available to the company from such facilities in the future 
see item md and a transmission expenses 
the company has equity interests in vermont yankee  velco and vermont electric transmission company  inc vetco  a wholly owned subsidiary of velco 
we have filed an exemption statement under section a of the public utility holding company act of  thereby securing exemption from the provisions of such act  except for section a  which prohibits the acquisition of securities of certain other utility companies without approval of the sec 
the sec has the power to institute proceedings to terminate such exemption for cause 
licensing 
pursuant to the federal power act  the ferc has granted licenses for the following hydroelectric projects we own issue date licensed period project site bolton

the relicensing application for waterbury was filed in august the waterbury reservoir was drained in to prepare for repairs to the dam by the state  presently estimated for completion in once repairs are complete  we expect the project to be relicensed for a year term and we do not have any competition for the waterbury license 
department of public service twenty year electric plan 
in december  the department adopted an update of its twenty year electrical power supply plan the plan for the state 
the plan includes an overview of statewide growth and development as they relate to future requirements for electrical energy  an assessment of available energy resources  and estimates of future electrical energy demand 
in june  we filed with the vpsb and the department an integrated resource plan pursuant to vermont statute vsa c 
that filing is still pending before the vpsb 
recent rate developments retail rate cases the company reached a final settlement agreement with the department in its rate case during november the final settlement agreement contained the following provisions the company received a rate increase of percent above existing rates  beginning with bills rendered january   and prior temporary rate increases became permanent  rates were set at levels that recover the company s hydro quebec vjo contract costs  effectively ending the regulatory disallowances experienced by the company from through  the company agreed not to seek any further increase in electric rates prior to april effective in bills rendered january unless certain substantially adverse conditions arise  including a provision allowing a request for additional rate relief if power supply costs increase in excess of million over forecasted levels  the company agreed to write off in approximately million in unrecovered rate case litigation costs  and to freeze its dividend rate until it successfully replaces short term credit facilities with long term debt or equity financing  seasonal rates were eliminated in april  which generated approximately million in additional cash flow in that can be utilized to offset increased costs during and  the company agreed to consult extensively with the department regarding capital spending commitments for upgrading our electric distribution system and to adopt customer care and reliability performance standards  in a first step toward possible development of performance based rate making  the company agreed to withdraw its vermont supreme court appeal of the vpsb s order in our rate case  and the company agreed to an earnings limitation for its electric operations in an amount equal to its allowed rate of return of percent  with amounts earned over the limit being used to write off regulatory assets 
on january   the vpsb approved our settlement with the department  with two additional conditions the company and customers shall share equally any premium above book value realized by the company in any future merger  acquisition or asset sale  subject to an million limit on the customers share  adjusted for inflation  and the company s further investment in non utility operations is restricted 
the company earned approximately million less than its allowed rate of return during before including in earnings deferred revenues in the same amount 
the company earned approximately  in excess of its allowed rate of return during before writing off regulatory assets in the same amount 
for further information regarding recent rate developments  see item md and a rates  and liquidity and capital resources  and note i of notes 
single customer dependence the company had one major retail customer  ibm  metered at two locations that accounted for percent  percent  and percent of total operating revenues  and percent  percent and percent of the company s retail operating revenues in  and  respectively 
ibm s percent of total revenues and mwh sales in increased due to a rate increase and a decrease in total operating revenues as a result of decreased sales for resale pursuant to the ms contract  which is discussed in greater detail in item of md and a power contract commitments 
no other retail customer accounted for more than percent of our revenue during the past three years 
ibm reduced its vermont workforce by  during  to a level of approximately  employees 
if future significant losses in electricity sales to ibm were to occur  the company s earnings could be impacted adversely 
if earnings were materially reduced as a result of lower retail sales  we would seek a retail rate increase from the vpsb 
the company is not aware of any plans by ibm to further reduce production at its vermont facility 
we currently estimate  based on a number of projected variables  the retail rate increase required from all retail customers by a hypothetical shutdown of the ibm facility to be in the range of five to ten percent  inclusive of projected declines in sales to residential and commercial customers 
see item md and a results of operations  operating revenues and mwh  and note a of notes 
competition and restructuring electric utilities historically have had exclusive franchises for the retail sale of electricity in specified service territories 
legislative authority has existed since that would permit vermont cities  towns and villages to own and operate public utilities 
since that time  no municipality served by the company has established a municipal public utility 
during  the town of rockingham rockingham  vermont initiated inquiries and legal procedures to establish its own electric utility  seeking to purchase the bellows falls hydroelectric facility from a third party  and the associated distribution plant owned by the company within the town 
in march  voters in rockingham approved an article authorizing rockingham to create a municipal utility by acting to acquire a municipal plant  which would include the electric distribution systems of the company and or central vermont public service corporation 
the company receives annual revenues of approximately million from its customers in rockingham 
should rockingham create a municipal system  the company would vigorously pursue its right to receive just compensation from rockingham 
such compensation would include full reimbursement for company assets  if acquired  and full reimbursement of any other costs associated with the loss of customers in rockingham  to assure that neither our remaining customers nor our shareholders effectively subsidize a rockingham municipal utility 
in  the vermont general assembly enacted legislation that authorized the department to sell electricity on a significantly expanded basis 
before the new law was passed  the department s authority to make retail sales had been limited to residential and farm customers and the department could sell only power that it had purchased from the niagara and st 
lawrence projects operated by the new york power authority 
under the law  the department can sell electricity purchased from any source at retail to all customer classes throughout the state  but only if it convinces the vpsb and other state officials that the public good will be served by such sales 
since  the department has made limited additional retail sales of electricity 
the department retains its traditional responsibilities of public advocacy before the vpsb and electricity planning on a statewide basis 
in certain states across the country  including the new england states  legislation has been enacted to allow retail customers to choose their electricity suppliers  with incumbent utilities required to deliver that electricity over their transmission and distribution systems 
increased competitive pressure in the electric utility industry may restrict the company s ability to charge energy prices sufficient to recover embedded costs  such as the cost of purchased power obligations or of generation facilities owned by the company 
the amount by which such costs might exceed market prices is commonly referred to as stranded costs 
regulatory and legislative authorities at the federal level and in some states  including vermont where legislation has not been enacted  are considering how to facilitate competition for electricity sales 
alternate forms of performance based regulation currently appear as possible intermediate steps towards deregulation 
for further information regarding competition and restructuring  see item md and a future outlook 
construction and capital requirements our capital expenditures for through and projected for are set forth in item md and a liquidity and capital resources construction 
construction projections are subject to continuing review and may be revised from time to time in accordance with changes in the company s financial condition  load forecasts  the availability and cost of labor and materials  licensing and other regulatory requirements  changing environmental standards and other relevant factors 
for the period  internally generated funds  after payment of dividends  provided approximately percent of our total capital requirements for construction  sinking fund obligations and other requirements 
internally generated funds provided percent of such requirements for we anticipate that for  internally generated funds will provide approximately percent of our total capital requirements for regulated operations  the remainder to be derived from bank loans 
in connection with the foregoing  see item md and a liquidity and capital resources 
power resources on february   the company entered into a contract with morgan stanley capital group  inc ms 
in august  the ms contract was modified and extended to december  the contract provides us a means of managing price risks associated with changing fossil fuel prices

  vermont yankee 
on july   vermont yankee completed the sale of its nuclear power plant to entergy nuclear vermont yankee entergy 
in addition to the sale of the generating plant  the transaction calls for entergy  through its power contract with vy  to provide percent of the plant output to the company through  which represents approximately percent of our projected energy requirements 
the company continues to own approximately percent of the common stock of vy 
our benefits of the plant sale and the vy power contract with entergy include vy receives cash approximately equal to the book value of the plant assets  removing the potential for stranded costs associated with the plant 
vy and its owners will no longer bear operating risks associated with running the plant 
vy and its owners will no longer bear the risks associated with the eventual decommissioning of the plant 
prices under the power purchase agreement between vy and entergy the ppa range from to per megawatt hour for the period beginning january  substantially lower than the forecasted cost of continued ownership and operation by vy 
contract prices ranged from to for  higher than the forecasted cost of continued ownership for the ppa calls for a downward adjustment in the price if market prices for electricity fall by defined amounts beginning no later than november if market prices rise  however  contract prices are not adjusted upward 
the company remains responsible for procuring replacement energy at market prices during periods of scheduled or unscheduled outages at the entergy plant 
the vy plant had fuel rods that required repair during may  a maintenance requirement that is not unique to vy 
vy closed the plant for a twelve day period  beginning on may   to repair the rods 
our cost for the repair  including incremental replacement energy costs  was approximately million 
the company received an accounting order from the vpsb on august   allowing it to defer the additional costs related to the outage  and believes that such amounts are probable of future recovery 
our ownership share of vy has increased from approximately percent last year to approximately percent currently  due to vy s purchase of certain minority shareholders interests 
vy s primary role consists of administering its power supply contract with entergy and its contracts with vy s present sponsors 
our entitlement to energy produced by the entergy nuclear plant has increased from approximately percent to percent of plant production through a series of transactions in connection with the sale of the plant to entergy 
the company and central vermont public service corporation acted as lead sponsors in the construction of the vermont yankee nuclear plant  a boiling water reactor designed by general electric company 
the plant  which became operational in  has a generating capacity of mw 
vermont yankee has also entered into capital funds agreements with its sponsor utilities that expired on december  under our capital funds agreement  we were required  subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approvals  to provide of the capital requirements of vermont yankee not obtained from outside sources 
during periods when vermont yankee power is unavailable  we occasionally incur replacement power costs in excess of those costs that we would have incurred for power purchased from vermont yankee 
replacement power is available to us from the iso and through contractual arrangements with other utilities 
replacement power costs adversely affect cash flow and  absent deferral  amortization and recovery through rates  would adversely affect reported earnings 
in the case of unscheduled outages of significant duration resulting in substantial unanticipated costs for replacement power  the vpsb generally has authorized deferral  amortization and recovery of such costs 
the entergy nuclear plant s current operating license expires march during the year ended december   we used  mwh of vermont yankee energy representing percent of the net electricity generated and purchased net power supply by the company 
the average cost of vermont yankee electricity in was per kwh 
vermont yankee s annual capacity factor for was percent compared with percent for  percent in  and percent in see note b and note k of notes for additional information 
hydro quebec highgate interconnection 
on september   the highgate transmission facilities  which were constructed to import energy from hydro quebec in canada  began commercial operation 
the transmission facilities at highgate include a mw ac to dc to ac converter terminal and seven miles of kv transmission line 
velco built and operates the converter facilities  which we own jointly with a number of other vermont utilities 
nepool hydro quebec interconnection 
velco and certain other nepool members have entered into agreements with hydro quebec  which provided for the construction in two phases of a direct interconnection between the electric systems in new england and the electric system of hydro quebec in canada 
the vermont participants in this project  which has a capacity of  mw  will derive about percent of the total power supply benefits associated with the nepool hydro quebec interconnection 
the company  in turn  receives approximately one third of the vermont share of those benefits 
the benefits of the interconnection include access to surplus hydroelectric energy from hydro quebec at competitive prices  energy banking  under which participating new england utilities will transmit relatively inexpensive energy to hydro quebec during off peak periods and will receive equal amounts of energy  after adjustment for transmission losses  from hydro quebec during peak periods when replacement costs are higher  and a provision for emergency transfers and mutual backup to improve reliability for both the hydro quebec system and the new england systems 
phase i 
the first phase phase i of the nepool hydro quebec interconnection consists of transmission facilities having a capacity of mw that traverse a portion of eastern vermont and extend to a converter terminal located in comerford  new hampshire 
these facilities entered commercial operation on october  vetco was organized to construct  own and operate those portions of the transmission facilities located in vermont 
total construction costs incurred by vetco for phase i were  of that amount  velco provided  of equity capital to vetco through sales of velco preferred stock to the vermont participants in the project 
the company purchased  of velco preferred stock to finance the equity portion of phase i 
the remaining  of construction cost was financed by vetco s issuance of  of long term debt in the fourth quarter of and the balance of  was financed by short term debt 
under the phase i contracts  each new england participant  including the company  is required to pay monthly its proportionate share of vetco s total cost of service  including its capital costs 
each participant also pays a proportionate share of the total costs of service associated with those portions of the transmission facilities constructed in new hampshire by a subsidiary of new england electric system 
phase ii 
agreements executed in among the company  velco  other nepool members and hydro quebec provided for the construction of the second phase phase ii of the interconnection between new england electric system and hydro quebec 
phase ii expanded the phase i facilities from mw to  mw  and provides for transmission of hydro quebec power from the phase i terminal in northern new hampshire to sandy pond  massachusetts 
construction of phase ii commenced in and was completed in late the phase ii facilities commenced commercial operation november   initially at a rating of  mw  and increased to a transfer capability of  mw in july the hydro quebec nepool firm energy contract provides for the import of economical hydro quebec energy into new england 
the company is entitled to percent of the phase ii power supply benefits 
total construction costs for phase ii were approximately  the new england participants  including the company  have contracted to pay monthly their proportionate share of the total cost of constructing  owning and operating the phase ii facilities  including capital costs 
as a supporting participant  the company must make support payments under year agreements 
these support agreements meet the capital lease accounting requirements under sfas at december   the present value of the company s obligation was approximately  the company s projected future minimum payments under the phase ii support agreements are approximately  for each of the years and an aggregate of  for the years the phase ii portion of the project is owned by new england hydro transmission electric company  inc and new england hydro transmission corporation  subsidiaries of new england electric system  in which certain of the phase ii participating utilities  including the company  own equity interests 
the company owns approximately percent of the equity of the corporations owning the phase ii facilities 
during construction of the phase ii project  the company  as an equity sponsor  was required to provide equity capital 
at december   the capital structure of such corporations was approximately percent common equity and percent long term debt 
see note b and note j of notes 
at times  we request that portions of our power deliveries from hydro quebec and other sources be routed through new york 
our ability to do so could be adversely affected by the proposed tariff that nepool has filed with the ferc  which would reduce our allocation of capacity on transmission interfaces with new york 
as a result  our ability to import power to vermont from outside new england could be adversely affected  thereby impacting our power costs in the future 
see item md and a transmission expenses 
hydro quebec power supply contracts 
we have several power purchase contracts with hydro quebec 
the bulk of our purchases are comprised of two schedules  b and c  pursuant to a firm contract dated december under these two schedules  we purchase mw 
from hydro quebec 
in november  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with hydro quebec under which hydro quebec paid  to the company in exchange for certain power purchase options 
the exercise of these options in resulted in an increase of approximately million of power supply expenses to meet contractual obligations under the company s december arrangement the arrangement  or with hydro quebec 
see item md and a power supply expenses  and note k of notes 
during  we used  mwh under schedule b  and  mwh under schedule c of the hydro quebec arrangements representing percent of our net power supply 
the average cost of hydro quebec electricity in was approximately per kwh 
nepool and short term opportunity purchases and sales 
we have arrangements with numerous utilities and power marketers actively trading power in new england and new york under which we purchase or sell of power on short notice and generally for brief periods of time when it appears economic to do so 
opportunity purchases are arranged when it is possible to purchase power for less than it would cost us to generate the power with our own sources 
purchases also help us save on replacement power costs during an outage of one of our base load sources 
opportunity sales are arranged when we have surplus energy available at a price that is economic to other regional utilities at any given time 
the sales are arranged based on forecasted costs of supplying the incremental power necessary to serve the sale 
prices are set so as to recover all of the forecasted fuel or production costs and to recover some  if not all  associated capacity costs 
nepool is the new england power pool whereby participants are able to buy and sell wholesale power  through the regional independent system operator  known as iso new england for the new england region  to meet current demand conditions within new england s transmission system  and within each participant s own distribution system 
the company uses power purchased from nepool and other short term opportunity market purchases to fulfill occasional changes in the demand and supply matrix 
during  the company purchased  mwh representing percent of the company s net power supply at an average cost of per kwh 
stony brook i 
the massachusetts municipal wholesale electric company mmwec is principal owner and operator of stony brook  a mw combined cycle intermediate generating station located in ludlow  massachusetts  which commenced commercial operation in november in october  we entered into a joint ownership agreement with mmwec  whereby we acquired an percent ownership share of the plant  entitling us to mw of capacity 
in addition to this entitlement  we have contracted for mw of capacity for the life of the stony brook i plant  for which we will pay a proportionate share of mmwec s share of the plant s fixed costs and variable operating expenses 
the three units that comprise stony brook i are all capable of burning oil 
two of the units are also capable of burning natural gas 
the natural gas system at the plant was modified in to allow two units to operate simultaneously on natural gas 
during  we used  mwh from this plant representing percent of our net power supply at an average cost of per kwh 
see note i of notes 
wyman unit the w

during  we used  mwh from this unit representing percent of our net power supply at an average cost of per kwh  based only on operation  maintenance  and fuel costs incurred during see note i of notes 
independent power producers 
the vpsb has adopted rules that implement for vermont the purchase requirements established by federal law in the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa 
under the rules  qualifying facilities have the option to sell their output to a central state purchasing agent under a variety of long and short term  firm and non firm pricing schedules 
each of these schedules is based upon the projected vermont composite system s power costs that would be required but for the purchases from independent producers 
the state purchasing agent assigns the energy so purchased  and the costs of purchase  to each vermont retail electric utility based upon its pro rata share of total vermont retail energy sales 
utilities may also contract directly with producers 
the rules provide that all reasonable costs incurred by a utility under the rules will be included in the utilities revenue requirements for ratemaking purposes 
currently  the state purchasing agent  vermont electric power producers  inc veppi  is authorized to seek mw of power from qualifying facilities under purpa  of which our average pro rata share in was approximately percent or mw 
the rated capacity of the qualifying facilities currently selling power to veppi is approximately mw 
these facilities were all online by the spring of  and no other projects are under development 
we do not expect any new projects to come online in the foreseeable future because excess capacity in the region has eliminated the need for and value of additional qualifying facilities 
in  through our direct contracts and veppi  we purchased  mwh of qualifying facilities production representing percent of our net power supply at an average cost of per kwh 
company hydroelectric power 
we wholly own and operate eight hydroelectric generating facilities located on river systems within our service area  the largest of which has a generating output of mw 
in  company owned hydroelectric plants provided  mwh of pollution free energy  representing percent of our net power supply at an average cost of per kwh based on total embedded costs and maintenance 
see state and federal regulation licensing 
velco 
the company and six other vermont electric distribution utilities own velco 
since commencing operation in  velco has transmitted power for its owners in vermont  including power from nypa and other power contracted for by vermont utilities 
velco also purchases bulk power for resale at cost to its owners  and as a member of nepool  represents all vermont electric utilities in pool arrangements and transactions 
see note b of notes 
fuel 
during  our retail and requirements wholesale sales were provided by the following fuel sources percent from hydroelectric sources percent hydro quebec  percent company owned  percent small power producers  and percent nypa  percent from a nuclear generating source the entergy nuclear plant  percent from wood  percent from natural gas  percent from oil  percent from wind  and percent purchased on a short term basis from other utilities through the iso 
we do not maintain long term contracts for the supply of oil for our wholly owned oil fired peak generating stations mw 
we did not experience difficulty in obtaining oil for our own units during  however  we are experiencing some difficulty during as a result of extended cold weather that has affected fuel deliveriesnone of the utilities from which we expect to purchase oil or gas fired capacity in has advised us of grounds for doubt about maintenance of secure sources of oil and gas during the year 
wood for the mcneil plant is furnished to the burlington electric department from a variety of sources under short term contracts ranging from several weeks to six months duration 
the mcneil plant used  tons of wood chips and mill residue   gallons of fuel oil  and  million cubic feet of natural gas in the mcneil plant  assuming any needed regulatory approvals are obtained  is forecasting consumption of wood chips to be  tons  fuel oil of  gallons and natural gas consumption of  million cubic feet 
the stony brook combined cycle generating station is capable of burning either natural gas or oil in two of its turbines 
natural gas is supplied to the plant subject to its availability 
during periods of extremely cold weather  the supplier reserves the right to discontinue deliveries to the plant in order to satisfy the demand of its residential customers 
we assume  for planning and budgeting purposes  that the plant will be supplied with gas during the months of april through november  and that it will run solely on oil during the months of december through march 
the plant maintains an oil supply sufficient to meet approximately one half of its annual needs 
wind project 
the company was selected by the department of energy doe and the electric power research institute epri to build a commercial scale wind powered facility 
the doe and epri provided partial funding for the wind project of approximately million 
the net cost to the company of the project  located in the southern vermont town of searsburg  was million

seasonal nature of business winter recreational activities  longer hours of darkness and heating loads from cold weather historically caused our average peak electric sales to occur in december  january or february 
summer air conditioning loads have increased in recent years as a result of steady economic growth in our service territory 
as a result  our heaviest load in  mw  occurred on august  under nepool market rules implemented in may  the cost basis that had supported the company s previous seasonally differentiated rate design was eliminated  making a seasonal rate structure no longer appropriate 
the elimination of the seasonal rate structure in all classes of service effective april was approved by the vpsb in january employees as of december   the company had employees  exclusive of temporary employees 
the company considers its relations with employees to be excellent 
energy efficiency in  gmp did not offer its own energy efficiency programs 
energy efficiency services were provided to gmp s customers by a statewide energy efficiency utility eeu known as efficiency vermont  created by the vpsb in the eeu is funded by a separate energy efficiency charge that appears as a line item on each customer bill 
in  the charge was percent of each customer s total electric bill 
some charges  such as late fees and outdoor lighting  are excluded 
the funds we collect are remitted to a fiscal agent representing the state of vermont 
from through  the company s efficiency programs achieved a cumulative annual saving of  megawatthours  saving approximately million per year for our customers 
rate design the company seeks to design rates to encourage the shifting of electrical use from peak hours to off peak hours 
since  we have offered optional time of use rates for residential and commercial customers 
currently  approximately  of the company s residential customers continue to be billed on the original time of use rate basis 
in  the company received regulatory approval for a rate design that permitted it to charge prices for electric service that reflected as accurately as possible the cost burden imposed by each customer class 
the company s rate design objectives are to provide a stable pricing structure and to accurately reflect the cost of providing electric services 
this rate structure helps to achieve these goals 
since inefficient use of electricity increases its cost  customers who are charged prices that reflect the cost of providing electrical service have real incentives to follow the most efficient usage patterns 
included in the vpsb s order approving this rate design was a requirement that the company s largest customers be charged time of use rates on a phased in basis by at december   approximately  of the company s largest customers  comprising percent of retail revenues  received service on mandatory time of use rates 
in may  the company filed its current rate design with the vpsb 
the parties  including the department  ibm and a low income advocacy group  entered into a settlement that was approved by the vpsb on december  under the settlement  the revenue allocation to each rate class was adjusted to reflect class by class cost changes since  the differential between the winter and summer rates was reduced  the customer charge was increased for most classes  and usage charges were adjusted to be closer to the associated marginal costs 
no modifications to base rate redesign have taken place since the vpsb order issued on december   however  as previously noted  the vpsb settlement order of january eliminated seasonal rate differentials effective april dispatchable and interruptible service contracts in  we had dispatchable power contracts contracts were year round  while the seasonal contracts included two major ski areas 
the dispatchable portion of the contracts allows customers to purchase electricity during times designated by the company when low cost power is available 
the customer s demand during these periods is not considered in calculating the monthly billing 
this program enables the company and the customers to benefit from load control 
we shift load from our high cost peak periods and the customer uses inexpensive power at a time when its use provides maximum value 
these programs are available by tariff for qualifying customers 
environmental matters we had been notified by the environmental protection agency epa that we were one of several potentially responsible parties for clean up at the pine street barge canal site in burlington  vermont 
in september  we negotiated a final settlement with the united states  the state of vermont  and other parties over terms of a consent decree that covers claims addressed in earlier negotiations and implementation of the selected remedy 
in october  the federal district court approved the consent decree that addresses claims by the epa for past pine street barge canal site costs  natural resource damage claims and claims for past and future oversight costs 
the consent decree also provides for the design and implementation of response actions at the site

the annual dividend rate was increased from per share to per share beginning with the quarterly dividend declared in december the company intends to increase the dividend in a measured consistent manner until the payout ratio falls between percent and percent of anticipated earnings 
we believe this payout ratio to be consistent with that of other utilities having similar risk profiles 
our current dividend policy reflects changes affecting the electric utility industry  which  in other jurisdictions  is moving away from the traditional cost of service regulatory model to a competition based market for power supply 
historically  we based our dividend policy on the continued validity of three assumptions the ability to achieve earnings growth  the receipt of an allowed rate of return that accurately reflects our cost of capital  and the retention of our exclusive franchise 
our board of directors will continue to assess and adjust the dividend  when appropriate  as the vermont electric industry evolves towards competition 
in addition  if other events beyond our control cause the company s financial situation to deteriorate  the board of directors would consider whether the current dividend level is appropriate

     item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in this section  we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for green mountain power corporation the company and its subsidiaries 
this explanation includes factors that affect our business  our earnings and costs in the periods presented and why they changed between periods  the source of our earnings  our expenditures for capital projects and what we expect they will be in the future  where we expect to get cash for future capital expenditures  and how all of the above affects our overall financial condition 
our critical accounting policies are discussed in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and other factors  and in item  note  significant accounting policies 
management believes the most critical accounting policies include the timing of expense and revenue recognition under the regulatory accounting framework within which we operate and the manner in which we account for certain power supply arrangements that qualify as derivatives 
these accounting policies  among others  affect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
there are statements in this section that contain projections or estimates and that are considered to be forward looking as defined by the securities and exchange commission the sec 
in these statements  you may find words such as believes  expects  plans  or similar words 
these statements are not guarantees of our future performance 
there are risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be different from those projected 
some of the reasons the results may be different are discussed under the captions power contract commitments  future outlook  transmission expenses  environmental matters  rates  and liquidity and capital resources  in this management discussion and analysis and include regulatory and judicial decisions or legislation  weather  changes in regional market and transmission rules  energy supply and demand and pricing  contractual commitments  availability  terms  and use of capital  general economic and business environment  changes in technology  nuclear and environmental issues  and industry restructuring and cost recovery including stranded costs 
these forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report 
earnings summary the company reported consolidated earnings of per share of common stock  diluted  in  compared to earnings of per share in and a loss of per share in the earnings represent a consolidated return on average common equity of percent  and a return on regulated operations of percent 
the consolidated return on average common equity was percent in and negative percent in income from continuing operations was per share  diluted  in  compared with per share  diluted  in  and a loss of per share in the company s subsidiary northern water resources  inc nwr  classified as discontinued in  earned per share in compared with a loss of per share in  and a loss of per share in a significant portion of nwr s assets  which consisted of energy generation and efficiency investments and wastewater treatment projects  have been sold  or otherwise disposed 
nwr s earnings resulted primarily from an adjustment to a reserve for warranty claims 
on january   the vermont public service board vpsb issued an order the settlement order approving a settlement between the company and the vermont department of public service the department that granted the company an immediate percent rate increase  and allowed full recovery of power supply costs under the hydro quebec vermont joint owners vjo contract the vjo contract 
the settlement order paved the way for restoration of the company s first mortgage bond credit rating to investment grade status in see rates retail rate cases and liquidity and capital resources in this section and enabled the company to earn its allowed rate of return of percent on regulated operations during and the improvement in earnings from continuing operations in compared with resulted from reductions in the company s cost of capital and other operating expenses  partially offset by increases in maintenance and transmission expenses and lower gross margins on the company s sales 
lower capital costs resulted from reduced interest rates and average debt levels  which caused interest expense to decline by million compared to  and the redemption of preferred stock which reduced preferred stock dividends million compared with lower gross margins resulted from an increase in power supply costs to serve retail customers  that was only partially offset by recognition of million in revenue deferred in under the settlement order 
the improvement in earnings from continuing operations in  compared with  resulted primarily from several factors  including power supply costs were million lower than during  principally due to decreased costs associated with the management of the company s long term power supply sale commitments to hydro quebec  and a decrease in lower margin wholesale sales of electricity  the percent retail rate increase under the settlement order resulted in an increase of million in retail operating revenues  and the write off in of million  or per share  in regulatory litigation costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and other risk factors 
power supply risk 
our material power supply contracts and arrangements are principally with hydro quebec  ms and vermont yankee nuclear power corporation 
at december   more than percent of our estimated load requirements through are expected to be met by these contracts and arrangements  and by our own generation and other power supply resources  which reduces the company s exposure to market prices 
a primary factor affecting future operating results is the volatility of the wholesale electricity market 
restructuring of the wholesale market for electricity has brought increased price volatility to our power supply markets 
inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions are the potential losses that may result from adverse changes in our commodity prices 
one objective of the company s risk management program is to stabilize cash flow and earnings by minimizing power supply risks 
transactions permitted by the risk management program include futures  forward contracts  option contracts  swaps and transmission congestion rights with counter parties that have at least investment grade ratings 
these transactions are used to hedge the risk of fossil fuel and spot market electricity price increases 
the company s risk management policy specifies risk measures  the amount of tolerable risk exposure  and authorization limits for transactions 
the company has a contract with morgan stanley capital group  inc ms  which is used to hedge against increases in fossil fuel prices 
ms purchases the majority of the company s power supply resources at index prices for fossil fuel resources or specified prices for contracted resources and then sells to us at a fixed rate to serve pre established load requirements 
this contract  along with other power supply commitments  allows the company to fix the cost of much of its power supply requirements  subject to power resource availability and other risks 
the ms contract is a derivative under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas and is effective through december  management s estimate of the fair value of the future net benefit of this arrangement at december  is approximately million 
assumptions used to calculate the future net benefit using the blacks option valuation model include a risk free interest rate of percent  volatility equivalent to a weighted average from nepool  which varies from percent in the first year to percent in the fourth year  locked in forward commitment prices for  with an estimated forward market price of approximately per mwh for periods beyond the forward price for electricity is consistent with the company s current long term wholesale energy price forecast 
actual results may differ materially from the table below 
we currently have an arrangement that grants hydro quebec an option to call power at prices that are expected to be below estimated future market rates 
this arrangement is a derivative and is effective through management s estimate of the fair value of the future net cost for this arrangement at december  is approximately million 
we sometimes use futures contracts to hedge forecasted sales of electric power under a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate exposure to the market price risk of  using the black scholes model  over the next years 
assumptions used within the model include a risk free interest rate of percent  volatility equivalent to the weighted average from nepool  which varies from percent in the first year to percent in year  locked in forward commitment prices for  and an average of approximately  mwh per year  with an estimated forward market price of per mwh for periods beyond the forward price for electricity is consistent with the company s current long term wholesale energy price forecast 
quoted forward market prices for monthly peak power rates are not currently available beyond the table below presents market risk estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in prices  which for the company s derivatives discussed above totals approximately million 
actual results may differ materially from the table below 
under an accounting order issued by the vpsb  changes in the fair value of derivatives are not recognized in earnings until the derivative positions are settled 
commodity price risk at december  fair value market risk in thousands net short position  regulatory risk there are currently no regulatory proceedings  court actions or pending legislative proposals to adopt electric industry restructuring in vermont 
however  if vermont adopted such restructuring  the major risk factors for the company that may arise from electric industry restructuring  including risks pertaining to the recovery of stranded costs  are regulatory and legal decisions  cost and amount of default service responsibility  the market price of power  and the amount of market share retained by the company 
there can be no assurance that any potential future restructuring plan ordered by the vpsb  the courts  or through legislation will include a mechanism that would allow for full recovery of our stranded costs and include a fair return on those costs as they are being recovered 
if laws are enacted or regulatory decisions are made that do not offer an adequate opportunity to recover stranded costs  we believe we have compelling legal arguments to challenge such laws or decisions 
the largest category of our potential stranded costs is future costs under long term power purchase contracts  which  based on current forecasts  are above market 
the magnitude of our stranded costs is largely dependent upon the future market price of power 
we have discussed various market price scenarios with interested parties for the purpose of identifying stranded costs 
preliminary market price assumptions  which are likely to change  have resulted in estimates by the company of its stranded costs of between million and million over the life of the contracts 
if retail competition is implemented in vermont  we cannot predict what the impact would be on the company s revenues from electricity sales 
historically  electric utility rates in vermont have been based on a utility s cost of service 
as a result  vermont electric utilities are subject to certain accounting standards that apply only to regulated businesses 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  allows regulated entities  including the company  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities  and thereby defer the income statement impact of certain costs and revenues that are expected to be realized in future rates 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because the company has concluded that they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections of costs 
the company s last retail rate case was filed during since that time a material amount of expenditures have been deferred as regulatory assets pending consideration by the vpsb in a future retail rate proceeding 
these regulatory assets have been judged as probable of recovery by management 
the most significant regulatory assets that are not being currently amortized in rates  or are being amortized at amounts that could materially differ from future expenditure levels  include regulatory assets at december  in thousands pine street barge canal 


  unscheduled vy outage costs 
 demand side management 


  storm damages 







  tree trimming 







regulatory assets 





  management s conclusion that these assets are probable of recovery is based on a variety of factors  including benefits to customers  consistency with past regulatory treatment  materiality of costs relative to normal cost levels  similar rate case decisions in other jurisdictions applying cost of service ratemaking principles  and opportunities to recover these costs over extended periods of time 
if the vpsb were to disallow any of these costs  the result would be a pretax charge to current earnings in the amount of the disallowance 
the company currently complies with the provisions of sfas if the company had determined that it no longer met the criteria for following sfas  at december  the accounting impact would have been an extraordinary non cash charge to operations of million 
factors that could give rise to the discontinuance of sfas include deregulation  a change in the regulators approach to setting rates from cost based regulation to another form of regulation  increasing competition that limits our ability to sell utility services or products at rates that will recover costs  and regulatory actions that limit rate relief to a level insufficient to recover costs 
the enactment of restructuring legislation or issuance of a regulatory order containing provisions that do not allow for the recovery of above market power costs would require the company to estimate and record losses immediately  on an undiscounted basis  for any above market power purchase contracts and other costs which are probable of not being recoverable from customers  to the extent that those costs are estimable 
we are unable to predict what form future legislation  if passed  or an order  if issued  will take  and we cannot predict if or to what extent sfas will continue to be applicable in the future 
however  we believe that the continued application of sfas is appropriate at this time 
we cannot predict whether restructuring legislation  if enacted by the vermont general assembly  or any subsequent report or actions of  or proceedings before  the vpsb or the vermont general assembly would have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition or credit ratings 
the failure to recover a significant portion of our purchased power costs  or to retain and attract customers in a competitive environment  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  including our operating results  cash flows and ability to pay dividends at current levels 
pension risk other critical accounting policies involve the non contributory defined benefit pension and postretirement health care benefit plans of the company 
the reported costs of these plans are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension and postretirement health care costs are impacted by actual employee demographics  the level of company contributions to the plans  earnings on plan assets  and health care cost trends postretirement health care plan only 
the company s pension and postretirement health care benefit plan assets consist of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns  as well as changes in general interest rates  may result in increased or decreased costs in future periods 
changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded defined benefit plan costs 
for example  the company in expects to reduce the expected return on its plan assets by basis points to percent  resulting in a  increase in plan expense 
see note h for further information 
as a result of our plan asset experience  at december   the company was required to recognize an additional minimum liability of million  net of applicable income taxes  as prescribed by sfas the liability was recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to other comprehensive income oci  and did not affect net income for the charge to oci may be restored through common equity in future periods to the extent fair value of trust assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation 
current changes to plan assumptions  along with plan losses experienced during  are expected to result in increased pension and postretirement health benefit expenses of approximately million and million  respectively  for compared with unregulated businesses most of the assets of nwr  which invested in energy generation  energy efficiency and wastewater treatment projects  have been sold 
nwr earned million in  compared with a loss of approximately million in  and a loss of million in the earnings and loss resulted primarily from provisions to recognize adjustments to liability estimates under warranties for past equipment sales 
risk factors associated with the discontinuation of nwr operations include the outcome of warranty litigation  and future cash requirements necessary to minimize costs of winding down wastewater operations 
several municipalities using wastewater treatment equipment provided by micronair  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of nwr  have commenced or threatened litigation against micronair 
the ultimate loss remains subject to the disposition of remaining nwr assets and liabilities  and could exceed the amounts recorded 
the company s unregulated rental water heater business earned million in  essentially unchanged from the prior two years

total operating revenues decreased million  or percent  in compared with  due to decreases in sales for resale  partially offset by increased retail operating revenues 
retail operating revenues increased million  or percent  in compared with due to the recognition of million of revenue deferred under the settlement order 
increased sales to residential and commercial customers also contributed to higher retail revenues  partially offset by a decline in revenues from international business machines corporation ibm 
in  total electricity sales decreased percent compared with  due principally to reduced sales for resale executed pursuant to the ms contract  described in more detail below under the headings power supply expenses and power contract commitments 
total operating revenues increased million  or percent  in compared with primarily due to increases in retail and other operating revenues  partially offset by a decrease in lower margin wholesale sales 
retail operating revenues increased million  or percent  in compared with due to a percent retail rate increase that went into effect january  and an additional increase in revenues from an industrial customer pursuant to revisions in a contract with that customer approved in the settlement order 
ibm  the company s largest customer  operates a manufacturing facility in essex junction  vermont 
ibm s electricity requirements for its facility accounted for approximately   and percent of the company s retail mwh sales in   and  respectively  and   and percent of the company s retail operating revenues in   and  respectively 
no other retail customer accounted for more than one percent of the company s revenue in any year 
since  the company has had agreements with ibm with respect to electricity sales above agreed upon base load levels 
on december   the vpsb approved a new three year agreement between the company and ibm  ending december  during  the vpsb approved a modification of this agreement for the last year of the term  the price of power for the three year term of the agreement is above our marginal costs of providing incremental service to ibm 
ibm reduced its vermont workforce by  during  to a level of approximately  employees 
if future significant losses in electricity sales to ibm were to occur  the company s earnings could be impacted adversely 
if earnings were materially reduced as a result of lower retail sales  the company would seek a retail rate increase from the vpsb 
the company is not aware of any plans by ibm to further reduce production at its vermont facility 
the company currently estimates  based on a number of projected variables  the retail rate increase required from all retail customers by a hypothetical shutdown of the ibm facility to be in the range of five to ten percent  inclusive of projected declines in sales to residential and commercial customers 
power supply expenses prior to  our inability to recover our power supply costs had been a primary reason for the poor performance of the company s common stock price during and the settlement order removed this obstacle by allowing the company rate recovery of its estimated power supply costs for furthermore  the settlement order allowed the company to defer approximately million in rate levelization revenues for recognition in and  if necessary  to achieve its allowed rate of return 
the company recognized approximately million of these revenues in and expects to recognize the remaining balance of million during the deferred recognition of rate levelization revenues allowed the company to achieve our allowed rate of return in without further rate relief and is expected to provide the company with the opportunity to achieve similar operating results in without further rate relief see power contract commitments  and rates retail rate cases in this section 
power supply expenses constituted   and percent of total operating expenses for the years   and  respectively 
power supply expenses decreased by million or percent in when compared with  and resulted from the following a million decrease in power purchased for resale  primarily under the arrangement with hydro quebec and our ms contract  a million decrease in the net cost of the arrangement with hydro quebec  and a million increase in the value of additional generation at the company s hydroelectric plants  that allowed the company to purchase less power during these decreases were partially offset by increased power supply expense in when compared with for the following reasons a million increase in the cost of power purchased from ms  a million net increase in the cost of power purchased from vermont yankee  including an offset of million for the increase in value of additional generation purchased from the plant  and a million increase in power purchased from independent power producers 
power supply expenses decreased by million or percent in when compared with the decrease in power supply expenses in compared with resulted from the following a million decrease in energy costs arising from a power supply arrangement with hydro quebec  discussed under the caption power contract commitments  whereby hydro quebec has an option to purchase energy at prices that are below market replacement costs  a million decrease in vermont yankee costs due primarily to the timing of scheduled outages at the plant  where the outage costs  including the costs of replacement power  are deferred and amortized over the subsequent refueling cycle  a million decrease in power purchased for resale  primarily under a power supply contract discussed under the caption power contract commitments below  pursuant to which the company purchases power from ms that is sufficient to serve pre established load requirements at a pre defined price  and a million decrease in company owned generation costs  reflecting a reduction in generation used to maintain system reliability as compared to the prior year when the unavailability of certain transmission equipment required these units to run more frequently 
in  these amounts were partially offset by the disallowance in rates of hydro quebec power contract costs that required million of those costs to be charged in and amortized as a reduction of power supply expenses during  million in higher energy prices in under our ms contract  and higher capacity costs in of approximately million 
the independent system operator of new england iso or iso new england was created to manage the operations of the new england power pool nepool  effective may  the iso works as a clearinghouse for purchasers and sellers of electricity in the deregulated wholesale energy markets 
sellers place bids for the sale of their generation or purchased power resources and if demand is high enough the output from those resources is sold 
we must purchase electricity to meet customer demand during periods of high usage and to replace energy repurchased by hydro quebec under the arrangement negotiated in our costs to serve demand during periods of warmer than normal temperatures in summer months and to replace such energy repurchases by hydro quebec rose substantially after the wholesale power markets became deregulated in  which caused much greater volatility in spot prices for electricity 
the cost of securing future power supplies had also risen substantially in tandem with higher summer power supply costs 
the company cannot predict the extent to which future prices will trade above historical levels of cost 
if the markets continue to experience the volatility evident since  or the company s power resources are unavailable during periods of high market prices  our earnings and cash flow could be adversely impacted by a material amount 
power contract commitments on february   we entered into a contract with ms as a result of our power requirements solicitation in a master power purchase and sales agreement ppsa between the company and ms defines the general contract terms under which the parties may transact 
sales under the ppsa commenced on february  and will terminate after all obligations under each transaction entered into by ms and the company have been fulfilled 
the ppsa was filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and the vpsb was notified as well 
in august  the ppsa was modified and extended to december  the ppsa provides us with a means of managing price risks associated with changing fossil fuel prices 
on a daily basis  and at ms s discretion  we sell power to ms from either i all or part of our portfolio of power resources at predefined operating and pricing parameters or ii any power resources available to us  provided that sales of power from sources other than company owned generation comply with the predefined operating and pricing parameters 
ms then sells to us  at a predefined price  power sufficient to serve pre established load requirements 
ms is also responsible for scheduling supply resources 
we remain responsible for resource performance and availability 
ms provides no coverage against major unscheduled outages 
the company and ms have agreed to the protocols that are used to schedule power sales and purchases and to secure necessary transmission 
we anticipate that arrangements we make to manage power supply risks will be on average more costly than the expected cost of fuel during the periods being hedged because these arrangements typically incorporate a risk premium 
the company s current purchases pursuant to the contract with hydro quebec entered into december  the contract are as follows schedule b megawatts of firm capacity and associated energy to be delivered at the highgate interconnection for twenty years beginning in september  and schedule c megawatts of firm capacity and associated energy to be delivered at interconnections to be determined at any time for years  which began in november pursuant to the contract  hydro quebec has the right to reduce the load factor from percent to percent a total three times over the life of the contract 
the company has the contractual right to delay any such reduction by one year under the contract 
during  hydro quebec exercised the first of these options for and the company delayed the effective date of this exercise until the company estimates that the net cost of hydro quebec s exercise of its option will increase power supply expense during by approximately million 
our contracts with hydro quebec contain cross default provisions that allow hydro quebec to invoke step up provisions under which the other vermont utilities that are party to the contract would be required to purchase their proportionate share of the power supply entitlement of the defaulting utility 
the company is not aware of any instance where this provision has been invoked by hydro quebec 
during  we negotiated an arrangement with hydro quebec that reduced the cost under our contract with hydro quebec over the november through october period the july agreement 
as part of the july agreement  we were obligated to purchase million in dollars worth of research and development work from hydro quebec over a four year period which was extended to  and made a million in dollars payment to hydro quebec in hydro quebec retains the right to curtail annual energy deliveries by percent up to five times  over the to period  if documented drought conditions exist in qu bec 
under the arrangement established in december  hydro quebec paid million to the company in in return for this payment  we provided hydro quebec options for the purchase of power 
commencing april  and effective through the term of the contract  which ends in  hydro quebec may purchase up to  mwh option a on an annual basis  at the contract energy prices  which are substantially below current market prices 
the cumulative amount of energy that may be purchased under option a shall not exceed  mwh 
over the same period  hydro quebec may exercise an option to purchase a total of  mwh option b at the contract energy price 
under option b  hydro quebec may purchase no more than  mwh in any year 
as of december   hydro quebec had purchased or called to purchase  mwh under option b 
in  hydro quebec exercised option a and called for deliveries to third parties at a net expense to the company of approximately million including capacity charges 
in  hydro quebec exercised option a and option b  and called for deliveries to third parties at a net expense to the company of approximately million  including capacity charges 
in  hydro quebec exercised option a and option b  and called for deliveries to third parties at a net expense to the company of approximately million including the cost of january and february  calls  and the cost of related financial positions  which was due to higher energy replacement costs incurred by the company 
approximately million of the million net costs were recovered in rates in the company believes that it is probable that hydro quebec will call options a and b for  and has purchased replacement power at a net cost of million 
the vpsb  in the settlement order stated  the record does not demonstrate that any other new england utility foresaw the extent and degree of volatility that has developed in the new england wholesale power markets 
absent that volatility  the agreement would not have had adverse effects 
in conjunction with the settlement order  hydro quebec committed to the department that it would not call any energy under option b of during the contract year ending october  on april   an arbitration tribunal issued its decision in the arbitration brought by a group of vermont electric companies and municipal utilities  known as the vermont joint owners vjo  against hydro quebec for its failure to deliver electricity pursuant to the vjo contract during the ice storm 
the company is a member of the vjo 
on july   the company received approximately million representing its share of refunded capacity payments from hydro quebec 
these proceeds reduced related deferred assets leaving a deferred balance of unrecovered arbitration costs of approximately million 
we believe it is probable that this balance will ultimately be recovered in rates 
vermont yankee nuclear power corporation vy on july   vermont yankee completed the sale of its nuclear power plant to entergy nuclear vermont yankee entergy 
in addition to the sale of the generating plant  the transaction calls for entergy through its power contract with vy  to provide percent of the plant output to the company through  which represents approximately percent of the company s energy requirements 
the company continues to own approximately percent of the common stock of vy 
our benefits of the plant sale and the vy power contract with entergy include vy receives cash approximately equal to the book value of the plant assets  removing the potential for stranded costs associated with the plant 
vy and its owners will no longer bear operating risks associated with running the plant 
vy and its owners will no longer bear the risks associated with the eventual decommissioning of the plant 
prices under the power purchase agreement between vy and entergy the ppa range from to per megawatt hour for the period beginning january  substantially lower than the forecasted cost of continued ownership and operation by vy 
contract prices ranged from to for  higher than the forecasted cost of continued ownership for the ppa calls for a downward adjustment in the price if market prices for electricity fall by defined amounts beginning no later than november if market prices rise  however  the contract prices are not adjusted upward 
the company remains responsible for procuring replacement energy at market prices during periods of scheduled or unscheduled outages at the entergy plant 
payments totaling million were made to vy s non vermont sponsors in return for guarantees those sponsors made to entergy to finalize the vy sale 
although the sale closed on july   the company s distribution of the sale proceeds and final accounting for the sale are pending certain regulatory approvals and the resolution of certain closing items between vy and entergy 
the company expects its share of the vy power plant sale proceeds  estimated at between million and million  to be distributed in the latter part of the sale required various regulatory approvals  all of which were granted on terms acceptable to the parties to the transaction 
certain intervener parties to the vpsb approval proceeding appealed the vpsb approval to the vermont supreme court 
that appeal is pending 
if the appellants prevail on their appeal  the vpsb could be required to conduct additional proceedings or to reconsider its order approving the sale 
other operating expenses other operating expenses decreased million  or percent in compared with the decrease was primarily due to reduced consulting costs of approximately million and reduced distribution expenses of million 
other operating expenses are not expected to increase significantly during other operating expenses decreased million  or percent in compared with the decrease was primarily due to a million charge during for disallowed regulatory litigation costs  ordered by the vpsb as part of the settlement order  offset in part by increased outside service expense during transmission expenses transmission expenses increased million  or percent  in compared with the company s relative share of transmission costs varies with the peak demand recorded on vermont s transmission system 
the company s share of those costs increased due to its increased load growth  relative to other vermont utilities  and also because of increased transmission investment by velco 
transmission expenses decreased million or percent in compared with during  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc accepted iso new england s request to implement a standard market design smd governing wholesale energy sales in new england 
the iso implemented its smd plan on march  smd includes a system of locational marginal pricing of energy  under which prices are determined by zone  and based in part on transmission congestion experienced in each zone 
currently  the state of vermont constitutes a single zone under the plan  although pricing may eventually be determined on a more localized nodal basis 
the company does not expect the implementation of this smd in its current form  which denominates vermont as a single pricing zone  to have a material impact on the company s power supply or transmission costs 
the ferc has suggested that change to nodal pricing might be appropriate as early as months after the implementation of smd 
the company believes that this could result in a material adverse impact on its power supply or transmission costs 
on july   ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend its regulations and modify its existing pro forma open access transmission tariff to require that all public utilities with open access transmission tariffs modify their tariffs to reflect non discriminatory  standardized transmission service and standard wholesale electric market design 
this rulemaking  known as the smd nopr  proposes to implement standard market design and locational marginal pricing in all regions of the united states  including new england 
the smd nopr is currently in the rulemaking comment period 
it is uncertain whether or how implementation of ferc s smd nopr  if and when approved  may differ from the iso new england smd plan  or how implementation of the smd nopr could impact the company s power supply or transmission costs  although the impacts could be material 
during  iso new england and the new york independent system operator filed and then withdrew their petition with the ferc proposing to establish a single northeastern regional transmission organization nerto encompassing the six new england states and new york 
iso new england has indicated an intention to file a petition with ferc to create a regional transmission organization comprising six new england states now part of the iso 
velco has proposed a project to substantially upgrade vermont s transmission system the northwest reliability project  principally to support reliability and eliminate transmission constraints in northwestern vermont  including most of the company s service territory 
the proposed northwest reliability project must be approved by the vpsb 
if approved  the project is estimated to cost approximately million over a seven to ten year period 
under current nepool and iso new england rules  which require qualifying large transmission project costs to be shared among all new england utilities  the company would expect the costs of this project to be allocated throughout the new england region  with vermont utilities responsible for approximately five percent of the total project costs 
however  in response to ferc s smd nopr and as part of iso new england s smd plan  iso new england is considering changes to the transmission cost allocation rules which could modify or eliminate the opportunity to allocate costs associated with the northwest reliability project to the new england region as a whole 
the company has vigorously advocated for continuation of the current cost allocation rules 
if these rules are modified or eliminated  the company and other vermont utilities could be required to bear a greater proportion  and potentially all  of the cost of the northwest reliability project 
maintenance expenses maintenance expenses increased million or percent in compared with  due to increased expenditures related to storm damage and increased right of way maintenance programs 
maintenance expenses increased million or percent in compared with due to increased expenditures on right of way maintenance programs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million or percent in compared with due to reductions in depreciation of utility plant in service  partially offset by increased amortization of software costs 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million or percent in compared with due to reductions in amortization of demand side management costs that were only partially offset by increased depreciation of utility plant in service 
income taxes income tax expense decreased million in compared with due to a decrease in the company s taxable income 
income tax expense increased million in when compared with that of due to an increase in the company s taxable income 
other income other income increased million in compared with due primarily to the vy recognition of deferred tax assets arising in conjunction with the sale of the vy plant  offset in part by payments made to out of state vy sponsors necessary to close the sale of the vy plant 
other income decreased million in compared with due in part to reduced interest income from the reduced investment returns available in interest expense interest expense decreased million or percent in compared with primarily due to scheduled and early redemptions of long term debt and reduced short term borrowing rates offset in part by higher average balances for short term borrowings 
interest expense on long term debt is expected to rise approximately million in due to increased average debt levels from long term bonds issued in december interest expense decreased million or percent in compared with primarily due to scheduled reductions in long term debt offset in part by a million term loan made on august  dividends on preferred stock dividends on preferred stock decreased million  or percent in compared with due to the repurchase of all outstanding preferred stock other than the percent class b shares 
dividends on preferred stock are expected to be negligible during see the discussion under the caption  liquidity and capital resources financing and capitalization 
dividends on preferred stock decreased  or percent in compared with due to repurchases of preferred stock 
environmental matters the electric industry typically uses or generates a range of potentially hazardous products in its operations 
we must meet various land  water  air and aesthetic requirements as administered by local  state and federal regulatory agencies 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these requirements  and that there are no outstanding material complaints about our compliance with present environmental protection regulations  except for developments related to the pine street barge canal site 
pine street barge canal site the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  commonly known as the superfund law  generally imposes strict  joint and several liability  regardless of fault  for remediation of property contaminated with hazardous substances 
we have previously been notified by the environmental protection agency epa that we are one of several potentially responsible parties prps for cleanup of the pine street barge canal site in burlington  vermont  where coal tar and other industrial materials were deposited 
in september  we negotiated a final settlement with the united states epa  the state of vermont the state  and other parties to a consent decree that covers claims with respect to the site and implementation of the selected site cleanup remedy 
in november  the consent decree was filed in the federal district court 
the consent decree addresses claims by the epa for past pine street barge canal site costs  natural resource damage claims and claims for past and future oversight costs 
the consent decree also provides for the design and implementation of response actions at the site 
as of december   our total expenditures related to the pine street barge canal site since were approximately million 
this includes amounts not recovered in rates  amounts recovered in rates  and amounts for which rate recovery has been sought but which are presently waiting further vpsb action 
the bulk of these expenditures consisted of transaction costs 
transaction costs include legal and consulting costs associated with the company s opposition to the epa s earlier proposals for a more expensive remedy at the site  litigation and related costs necessary to obtain settlements with insurers and other prps to provide amounts required to fund the clean up remediation costs  and to address liability claims at the site 
a smaller amount of past expenditures was for site related response costs  including costs incurred pursuant to epa and state orders that resulted in funding response activities at the site  and to reimburse the epa and the state for oversight and related response costs 
the epa and the state have asserted and affirmed that all costs related to these orders are appropriate costs of response under cercla for which the company and other prps were legally responsible 
we estimate that we have recovered or secured  or will recover  through settlements of litigation claims against insurers and other parties  amounts that exceed estimated future remediation costs  future federal and state government oversight costs and past epa response costs 
we currently estimate our unrecovered transaction costs mentioned above  which were necessary to recover settlements sufficient to remediate the site  to oppose much more costly solutions proposed by the epa  and to resolve monetary claims of the epa and the state  together with our remediation costs  to be million over the next years 
the estimated liability is not discounted  and it is possible that our estimate of future costs could change by a material amount 
we also have recorded an offsetting regulatory asset and we believe that it is probable that we will receive future revenues to recover these costs 
through rate cases filed in    and  we sought and received recovery for ongoing expenses associated with the pine street barge canal site 
while reserving the right to argue in the future about the appropriateness of full rate recovery of the site related costs  the company and the department  and as applicable  other parties  reached agreements in these cases that the full amount of the site related costs reflected in those rate cases should be recovered in rates 
we proposed in our rate filing made on june  recovery of an additional million in such expenditures 
in an order in that case released march   the vpsb suspended the amortization of expenditures associated with the pine street barge canal site pending further proceedings 
although it did not eliminate the rate base deferral of these expenditures  or make any specific order in this regard  the vpsb indicated that it was inclined to agree with other parties in the case that the ultimate costs associated with the pine street barge canal site  taking into account recoveries from insurance carriers and other prps  should be shared between customers and shareholders of the company 
in some other jurisdictions  sharing has been accomplished by allowing utilities to recover costs over time without a rate of return 
in response to our motion for reconsideration  the vpsb on june  stated its intent was to reserve for a future docket issues pertaining to the sharing of remediation related costs between the company and its customers 
the settlement order released january  did not change the status of pine street barge canal site cost recovery 
clean air act because we purchase most of our power supply from other utilities  we do not anticipate that we will incur any material direct cost increases as a result of the federal clean air act or proposals to make more stringent regulations under that act 
furthermore  only one of our power supply purchase contracts  which expired in early  related to a generating plant that was affected by phase i of the acid rain provisions of this legislation  which went into effect january  rates retail rate cases the company reached a final settlement agreement with the department in its rate case during november the final settlement agreement contained the following provisions the company received a rate increase of percent above existing rates  beginning with bills rendered january   and prior temporary rate increases became permanent  rates were set at levels that recover the company s hydro quebec vjo contract costs  effectively ending the regulatory disallowances experienced by the company from through  the company agreed not to seek any further increase in electric rates prior to april effective in bills rendered january unless certain substantially adverse conditions arise  including a provision allowing a request for additional rate relief if power supply costs increase in excess of million over forecasted levels  the company agreed to write off in approximately million in unrecovered rate case litigation costs  and to freeze its dividend rate until it successfully replaces short term credit facilities with long term debt or equity financing  seasonal rates were eliminated in april  which generated approximately million in additional cash flow in that can be utilized to offset increased costs during and  the company agreed to consult extensively with the department regarding capital spending commitments for upgrading our electric distribution system and to adopt customer care and reliability performance standards  in a first step toward possible development of performance based rate making  the company agreed to withdraw its vermont supreme court appeal of the vpsb s order in a rate case  and the company agreed to an earnings limitation for its electric operations in an amount equal to its allowed rate of return of percent  with amounts earned over the limit being used to write off regulatory assets 
on january   the vpsb approved the company s settlement with the department  with two additional conditions the company and customers shall share equally any premium above book value realized by the company in any future merger  acquisition or asset sale  subject to an million limit on the customers share  adjusted for inflation  and the company s further investment in non utility operations is restricted 
the company earned approximately million less than its allowed rate of return during before including in earnings deferred revenues in the same amount 
the company earned approximately  in excess of its allowed rate of return during before writing off regulatory assets in the same amount 
the vpsb  in its order approving vy s sale of its nuclear power plant to entergy  ordered the company and central vermont public service each to file on or before april   a cost of service study based on actual data  to enable the vpsb to determine whether an adjustment to rates is justified in or the company believes this filing will support the company s current rates and does not intend to request a rate increase or decrease when this filing is made 
the vpsb could initiate an investigation of the company s rates based on this filing  requiring the company to complete a rate case  and the vpsb could order an adjustment to the company s rates based on its findings and conclusions 
if the vpsb ordered the company to reduce its rates in or  this could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  cash flows and ability to pay dividends at current levels 
liquidity and capital resources construction our capital requirements result from the need to construct facilities or to invest in programs to meet anticipated customer demand for electric service 
capital expenditures  net of customer advances for construction  over the past three years and forecasted for are as follows generation transmission distribution conservation other total in thousands actual forecast other includes million in  million in  million in  and an estimated million in for the pine street barge canal site 
a statewide energy efficiency utility set up by the vpsb in manages all energy efficiency programs  receiving funds the company bills to its customers as a separate charge 
dividend policy the annual dividend was per share for the year ended december  the settlement order had limited the annual dividend rate at its then current level of per share until short term credit facilities were replaced with long term debt or equity financing 
the company used proceeds of a million long term debt issue in december to replace all short term borrowings  satisfying the conditions in the settlement order and permitting the company to raise its dividend 
the annual dividend rate was increased from per share to per share beginning with the quarterly dividend declared in december the company intends to increase the dividend in a measured consistent manner until the payout ratio falls between percent and percent of anticipated earnings 
the company believes this payout ratio to be consistent with that of other utilities having similar risk profiles 
financing and capitalization internally generated funds provided approximately percent  percent  and percent  of requirements for  and  respectively 
the rate of internally generated funding requirements was reduced because of accelerated redemptions of preferred stock and common stock repurchases described in more detail below 
internally generated funds  after payment of dividends  provide capital requirements for construction  sinking funds and other requirements 
we anticipate that for  internally generated funds will provide approximately percent of total capital requirements for regulated operations  the remainder to be derived from bank loans 
the company is not dependent on the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities 
we do have material power supply commitments that are discussed in detail under the captions power contract commitments and power supply expenses 
we also own an equity interest in velco  which requires the company to contribute capital when required and to pay a portion of velco s operating costs 
at december   our capitalization consisted of percent common equity and percent long term debt 
the company has a million day revolving credit agreement with fleet financial services fleet joined by keybank national association keybank  expiring june the fleet key agreement 
the fleet key agreement is unsecured and allows the company to choose any blend of a daily variable prime rate and a fixed term libor based rate 
there was million outstanding with a weighted average rate of percent on the fleet key agreement at december  there was no non utility short term debt outstanding at december  or the company negotiated a million  two year  unsecured loan agreement with fleet  joined by keybank  on august  the million loan was repaid on december  on march   the company redeemed million of the percent first mortgage bonds due june  during march and june  the company repurchased and million  respectively  of the percent class e preferred stock outstanding 
on may   the company redeemed million of the percent class c preferred stock outstanding

in the event of a change in the company s first mortgage bond credit rating to below investment grade  scheduled payments under the company s first mortgage bonds would not be affected 
such a change would require the company to post what would currently amount to a million bond under our remediation agreement with the epa regarding the pine street barge canal site

due to sharp declines in the equity markets during and  the value of assets held in trusts to satisfy the company s pension plan obligations has decreased 
the company s pension plan assets are primarily made up of public equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
the company s funding policy is to make voluntary contributions to its defined benefit plans before erisa or pension benefit guaranty corporation requirements mandate such contributions under minimum funding rules  and so long as the company s liquidity needs do not preclude such investments 
the company made voluntary pension plan contributions totaling million between september  and december  the company plans to make additional voluntary contributions totaling million before june  the company s pension costs and cash funding requirements could increase in future years in the absence of recovery in the equity markets 
other regulatory proceedings and litigation in a series of vermont regulatory proceedings  the company has agreed to undertake a process known as distributed utility planning as part of its transmission and distribution planning process 
distributed utility planning requires the company to evaluate conservation related alternatives and distributed generation alternatives to typical transmission and distribution capital investments 
in certain circumstances  the company may be required to implement conservation or distributed generation alternatives in lieu of  or in addition to  traditional transmission and distribution capital investments  where societal cost savings associated with conservation or distributed generation  including the costs associated with avoided electricity sales  justify the expenditures 
the company is uncertain of the potential magnitude of future spending requirements for this program  but note they could be material 
costs associated with conservation measures or distributed generation facilities not owned by the company would be deferred as regulatory assets pending future rate proceedings 
in  the owners of property along the shoreline of joe s pond  an impoundment located in danville  vermont  created by the company s west danville dam hydroelectric generating facility  filed an inquiry with the vpsb seeking review of certain dam improvements made by the company in  complaining that the company did not obtain all necessary regulatory approvals for the improvements and that the company s improvements and subsequent operation of the dam have caused flooding of the shoreline and property damage 
the company has petitioned the vpsb to make additional dam improvements at the facility at an estimated cost of  the vpsb must approve the company s petition before the proposed improvements can be implemented 
this regulatory proceeding is pending and the company is unable to predict whether the company s petition will be approved or whether the vpsb will impose regulatory conditions or penalties 
future outlook competition and restructuring the electric utility business are experiencing rapid and substantial changes 
these changes are the result of the following trends disparity in electric rates  transmission  and generating capacity among and within various regions of the country  improvements in generation efficiency  increasing demand for customer choice  new regulations and legislation intended to foster competition  also known as restructuring  and increasing volatility of wholesale market prices for electricity 
electric utilities historically have had exclusive franchises for the retail sale of electricity in specified service territories 
as a result  competition for retail customers has been limited to competition with alternative fuel suppliers  primarily for heating and cooling  competition with customer owned generation  and direct competition among electric utilities to attract major new facilities to their service territories 
these competitive pressures have led the company and other utilities to offer  from time to time  special discounts or service packages to certain large customers 
in certain states across the country  including all the new england states except vermont  legislation has been enacted to allow retail customers to choose their electricity suppliers  with incumbent utilities required to deliver that electricity over their transmission and distribution systems also known as retail wheeling 
increased pressure in the electric utility industry may restrict the company s ability to charge energy prices sufficient to recover costs of service  such as the cost of purchased power obligations or of generation facilities owned by the company 
the amount by which such costs might exceed market prices is commonly referred to as stranded costs 
regulatory and legislative authorities at the federal level and in some states  including vermont where legislation has not been enacted  are considering whether  when and how to facilitate competition for electricity sales at the retail level 
recent difficulties in some regulatory jurisdictions  such as california  have dampened any immediate push towards deregulation in vermont 
alternate forms of performance based regulation currently appear as possible intermediate steps towards deregulation 
however  in the future  the vermont general assembly through legislation  or the vpsb through a subsequent report  action or proceeding  may allow customers to choose their electric supplier 
if this happens without providing for recovery of the costs associated with our power supply obligations and other costs of providing vertically integrated service  the company s franchise  including our operating results  cash flows and ability to pay dividends at the current level  would be adversely affected 
during  the town of rockingham rockingham  vermont initiated inquiries and legal procedures to establish its own electric utility  seeking to purchase the bellows falls hydroelectric facility from a third party  and the associated distribution plant owned by the company within the town 
in march  voters in rockingham approved an article authorizing rockingham to create a municipal utility by acting to acquire a municipal plant  which would include the electric distribution systems of the company and or central vermont public service corporation 
the company receives annual revenues of approximately million from its customers in rockingham 
should rockingham create a municipal system  the company would vigorously pursue its right to receive just compensation from rockingham 
such compensation would include full reimbursement for company assets  if acquired  and full reimbursement of any other costs associated with the loss of customers in rockingham  to assure that neither our remaining customers nor our shareholders effectively subsidize a rockingham municipal utility 
nuclear decommissioning the staff of the sec has questioned certain current accounting practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition  measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating units in financial statements 
in response to these questions  the financial accounting standards board fasb had agreed to review the accounting for closure and removal costs  including decommissioning 
the fasb issued a new statement in august for accounting for asset retirement obligations  which provides guidance on accounting for nuclear plant decommissioning costs  as well as other asset retirement costs 
the company has not yet determined what impact  if any  the new accounting standard will have on its investment in vy 
we do not believe that changes in such accounting  if required  would have an adverse effect on the results of our operations due to our current and future ability to recover decommissioning costs through rates 
effects of inflation financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and report operating results in terms of historic costs 
this accounting provides reasonable financial statements but does not always take inflation into consideration 
as rate recovery is based on these historical costs and known and measurable changes  the company is able to receive some rate relief for inflation
