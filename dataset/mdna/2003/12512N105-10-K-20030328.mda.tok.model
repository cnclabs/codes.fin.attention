the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview we are the largest direct marketer of multi brand computers and related technology products and services in the united states 
our primary business is conducted from a combined corporate office and distribution center located in vernon hills  illinois  sales offices in mettawa and chicago  illinois  and a sales office in lansdowne  virginia 
additionally  we market and sell products through cdw 
com and cdwg

financial reporting release no 
 released by the securities and exchange commission  encourages all registrants to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
we present in the notes to our consolidated financial statements a summary of these accounting policies 
our most significant accounting policies relate to the sale  purchase  distribution and promotion of our products 
therefore  our accounting principles in the areas of revenue recognition  trade accounts receivable valuation  inventory valuation  vendor transactions and marketing activities are the most significant 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and revisions to estimates are included in our results for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
significant estimates in our financial statements include allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  sales returns and pricing disputes  net realizable value of inventories  vendor transactions and loss contingencies 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio along with specifically identified customer risks 
if actual customer payment performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected  additional allowances may be required 
sales returns and pricing disputes 
at the time of sale  we record an estimate for sales returns and pricing disputes based on historical experience 
net realizable value of inventories 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we decrease the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents vendor transactions 
we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  rebates  price protection and other programs 
these incentives generally relate to agreements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to gross margin or net advertising expense  as appropriate 
if market conditions were to deteriorate  vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs 
loss contingencies 
we accrue for contingent obligations when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales percentage of net sales financial results years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses net advertising expenses income from operations interest and other income income before income taxes income tax provision net income the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a summary of certain of our consolidated operating statistics operating statistics years ended december  number of invoices processed average invoice size commercial customers served of sales to commercial customers sales force  end of period annualized inventory turnover accounts receivable days sales outstanding direct web sales s daily average web users commercial customers is defined as public sector and corporate customers excluding consumers

table of contents the average selling price of desktop computers decreased  servers decreased and notebook computers decreased from unit sales of desktop computers increased and unit sales of servers increased from  while unit sales of notebook computers decreased from we believe there may be future decreases in pricing for computer products in  resulting in a lower average invoice size 
such decreases require us to generate more orders and sell more units in order to maintain or increase the level of sales 
on a forward looking basis  we believe that cautious assumptions as to the rate of sales growth in are appropriate  primarily due to uncertainty related to economic as well as political conditions  and potentially lower unit selling prices and reduced it spending 
gross profit increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to in  compared with in our gross profit objective as a percentage of net sales is between and 
the gross profit margin depends on various factors  including vendor inventory price protection and rebate programs  product mix  including third party services  pricing strategies  market conditions and other factors  any of which could result in a fluctuation of gross margins below recent experience

on a forward looking basis  during  we plan to expand our sales force in both the corporate and public sector segments by a total of approximately account managers 
selling and administrative expenses may increase as a percentage of net sales over prior year levels due to investments in additional sales personnel

public sector segment sales increased  from million in to million in  and comprised of our total sales for corporate segment sales declined to billion in due to reduced it spending levels in a difficult economic environment and reduced average selling prices per unit 
the growth in our public sector segment was due in part to focused sales and marketing efforts in the federal  state and local government and educational institution markets and the fact that these customers did not reduce it budgets as severely as those in the corporate markets
