more information about potential factors that could affect our business and financial results is included in the section entitled risk factors 
overview we are a leading animal health care services company and operate the largest networks of veterinary diagnostic laboratories and free standing  full service animal hospitals in the united states 
our network of veterinary diagnostic laboratories provides sophisticated testing and consulting services used by veterinarians in the detection  diagnosis  evaluation  monitoring  treatment and prevention of diseases and other conditions affecting animals 
our animal hospitals offer a full range of general medical and surgical services for companion animals 
we treat diseases and injuries  offer pharmaceutical products and perform a variety of pet wellness programs  including routine vaccinations  health examinations  diagnostic testing  spaying  neutering and dental care 
our company was formed in by robert antin  arthur antin and neil tauber  who have served since our inception as our chief executive officer  chief operating officer and senior vice president of development  respectively 
during the s  we established a premier position in the veterinary diagnostic laboratory and animal hospital markets through both internal growth and acquisitions 
by  we achieved a critical mass  building a laboratory network of laboratories servicing animal hospitals in most states and completing acquisitions for a total of animal hospitals 
at december   our laboratory network consisted of laboratories serving all states and our animal hospital network consisted of animal hospitals in states 
we are focusing primarily on generating internal growth to increase revenue and profitability 
in order to augment internal growth  we may selectively acquire laboratories and intend to acquire approximately to animal hospitals per year  depending upon the attractiveness of candidates and the strategic fit with our existing operations 

table of contents the following table summarizes our growth in facilities for the periods presented year ended december laboratories beginning of period acquisitions and new facilities relocated into other labs operated by us end of period animal hospitals beginning of period acquisitions relocated into hospitals operated by us sold or closed end of period owned at end of period managed at end of period we were a publicly traded company from until september  when we completed a recapitalization 
the recapitalization was completed in a financial market which we believed did not adequately value companies of our size and type because the market s focus and attention was largely on technology and internet based companies 
the recapitalization was financed by the purchase of million of common stock  series a and series b preferred stock by a group of investors led by leonard green partners  the borrowing of million under our million senior credit facility  the issuance of an aggregate of million of senior notes  and the issuance of an aggregate of million of senior subordinated notes 
our subsequent performance and the changing market dynamics supported the determination by our board of directors to re enter the public sector 
on november  we consummated our initial public offering 
as a result of this offering and the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option  we issued  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million 
concurrent with the consummation of the initial public offering  our wholly owned subsidiary issued million in principal amount of senior subordinated notes 
we applied the net proceeds from the offering and the sale of the senior subordinated notes  plus cash on hand  as follows redeemed all of our outstanding series a and series b redeemable preferred stock for million  repaid million in principal amount of our senior term a and b notes  repaid million in principal amount of our senior notes due  at a redemption price of plus accrued and unpaid interest  and repaid million in principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due  at a redemption price of  plus accrued and unpaid interest 

table of contents in subsequent transactions  we repaid our senior term a and senior term b notes with the proceeds acquired from the issuance of senior term c notes  which bear a lower interest rate than the weighted average interest rate for the senior term a and senior term b notes  repaid million  the entire outstanding principal amount  of our senior subordinated notes due  at a redemption price of  plus accrued and unpaid interest  and repaid million in principal amount of our senior notes due  at a redemption price of  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in february  we consummated our secondary public offering 
as a result of this offering and the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option  we issued  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million 
we applied the net proceeds from the secondary offering as follows used million to repay the entire remaining principal amount of million of our senior notes due  at a redemption price of  plus accrued and unpaid interest  and retained the remainder for general corporate purposes 
basis of reporting general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we report our operations in three segments laboratory  animal hospital and corporate 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expense  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue only after the following criteria are met there exists adequate evidence of the transaction  delivery of goods has occurred or services have been rendered  and the price is not contingent on future activity and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we report our revenue net of discounts 
laboratory revenue a portion of laboratory revenue is intercompany revenue that was generated by providing laboratory services to our animal hospitals 
laboratory internal revenue growth for the year ended december  was calculated using laboratory revenue as reported  adjusted to exclude revenue for the newly acquired laboratory that we did not own for the entire period presented  as compared to our laboratory revenue as reported for the prior comparable period 

table of contents prior to  our systems would not allow for the tracking of specific revenue that resulted from each laboratory acquisition 
therefore  we calculated an estimate of revenue generated for each newly acquired laboratory subsequent to the date of purchase for use in calculating laboratory internal revenue growth 
laboratory internal revenue growth for the year ended december  was calculated using laboratory revenue as reported  adjusted to exclude  for the laboratory that we did not own for the entire period presented  an estimate of revenue generated by this newly acquired laboratory subsequent to the date of purchase 
we calculated this estimate of revenue for the newly acquired laboratory using an historical twelve month revenue figure provided to us by the seller of the acquired laboratory  which amount was increased by our laboratory revenue growth rate for the prior year 
in calculating the laboratory revenue growth rate for  the year following the acquisition  we excluded from our reported laboratory revenue the estimated annual revenue attributable to newly acquired laboratory multiplied by a fraction representing the portion of the year in the year of acquisition that we did not own the facility 
we determined our laboratory internal revenue growth rate for the applicable period by comparing our laboratory revenue net of estimated laboratory revenue of newly acquired laboratories to our laboratory revenue as reported for the prior comparable period 
we believe these methods fairly presented our laboratory internal revenue growth for the periods stated 
our differences in calculations or errors in estimates used would not have a material effect on our laboratory internal growth rates presented in this annual report 
laboratory revenue is presented net of discounts 
some discounts  such as those given to clients for prompt payment  are applied to clients accounts in periods subsequent to the period the revenue was recognized 
these discounts which are not yet applied to clients accounts are estimated and deducted from revenue in the period the related revenue was recognized 
these estimates are based upon historical experience 
errors in estimates would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
animal hospital revenue animal hospital revenue is comprised of revenue of the animal hospitals that we own and the management fees of animal hospitals that we manage 
certain states prohibit business corporations from providing or holding themselves out as providers of veterinary medical care 
in these states  we enter into arrangements with a veterinary medical group that provides all veterinary medical care  while we manage the administrative functions associated with the operation of the animal hospitals and own or lease the hospital facility from a third party 
in return for our services  the veterinary medical group pays us a management fee 
we do not consolidate the operations of animal hospitals that we manage 
however  when we analyze revenue and same facility revenue growth for animal hospitals  we use combined revenue and an adjusted same facility measure that are calculated using the combined revenue of animal hospitals owned and managed for the entire periods presented 
we feel that combined revenue and adjusted same facility revenue are important measures because they reflect the overall performance of all animal hospitals owned and managed 
we have provided reconciliations of these revenue measures to the gaap based revenue measures in results of operations 
adjusted same facility revenue growth and same facility revenue growth based on gaap include revenue generated by customers referred from our relocated or combined animal hospitals  including those combined upon acquisition 
other revenue we received consulting fees from heinz pet products relating to the marketing of its proprietary pet food 
as of september  these consulting agreements with heinz pet products had all expired 
direct costs laboratory direct costs are comprised of all costs of laboratory services  including salaries of veterinarians  specialists  technicians and other non administrative  laboratory based personnel  facilities rent  occupancy costs and supply costs 
animal hospital direct costs are comprised of all costs of services and products at the hospitals  including salaries of veterinarians  technicians and all other hospital based personnel employed by the hospitals we own  facilities rent  occupancy costs  supply costs  certain marketing and promotional expense and costs of goods 
table of contents sold associated with the retail sales of pet food and pet supplies 
direct costs do not include salaries of veterinarians  technicians and certain other hospital based personnel employed by the hospitals we manage 
as a result  our direct costs are lower as a percentage of revenue than if we had consolidated the operating results of the animal hospitals we manage into our operating results 
when we analyze animal hospital direct costs we use the combined direct costs of animal hospitals owned and managed for the entire periods presented 
we feel that combined direct costs is an important measure because it reflects the overall performance of all animal hospitals owned and managed 
we have provided a reconciliation of combined direct costs to the gaap based animal hospital direct costs as reported in results of operations 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expense is divided between our laboratory  animal hospital and corporate segments 
laboratory selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of sales and administrative personnel and selling  marketing and promotional expense 
animal hospital selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of field management and administrative personnel  recruiting and certain marketing expense 
corporate selling  general and administrative expense consists of administrative expense at our headquarters  including the salaries of corporate officers  rent  accounting  finance  legal and other professional expense and occupancy costs 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda is operating income before depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda and its components  adjusted laboratory ebitda and adjusted animal hospital ebitda for the periods presented represent ebitda for the applicable operating unit adjusted to exclude recapitalization costs  management fees paid pursuant to our management services agreement with leonard green partners  which was terminated in november  write down of assets  non cash compensation expenses and certain other significant items itemized in the reconciliations presented in selected financial data 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap  or as a measure of profitability or liquidity 
we believe ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful measures of our operating performance as they reflect earnings before the impact of items that may change from period to period for reasons not directly related to our operations  such as depreciation and amortization  interest and taxes and other certain significant items 
ebitda is also an important component of the financial ratios included in our debt covenants and provides us with a measure of our ability to service our debt and meet capital expenditure requirements from our operating results 
our calculation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
non cash compensation certain stock options granted in qualified as variable stock options that required us to recognize non cash compensation of million and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  as laboratory direct costs and selling  general and administrative expense 
in august  all of these options were exercised 
software development costs we frequently research  develop and implement new software to be used internally  or enhance our existing internal software 
we develop the software using our own employees and or outside consultants 
costs associated with the development of new software are expensed as incurred  particularly in the preliminary planning stages and the post implementation and training stages 
costs related directly to the software design  coding  testing and installation are capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the software  generally three to five years 
costs related to upgrades or enhancements of existing systems are capitalized if the modifications result in additional functionality 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant estimates under generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  in the united states  management is required to make critical accounting estimates that directly impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
critical accounting estimates are estimates that meet two criteria the estimates require that we make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  there exist different estimates that could reasonably be used in the current period  or changes in the estimates used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  both of which would have a material impact on the presentation of the financial condition or our results of our operations 
management bases its assumptions and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the following represent what management believes are the critical accounting policies most affected by significant management estimates and judgments 
management has discussed these critical accounting policies  the basis for their underlying assumptions and estimates and the nature of our related disclosures herein with our audit committee 
workers compensation expense workers compensation expense is the cost to insure our company against losses related to injuries incurred by our employees in the normal course of their duties 
historically  the major component of workers compensation expense was the insurance premium  or the cost of the insurance policy itself 
however  commencing in the third quarter of  we restructured our workers compensation insurance policies to a self insurance retention program in an effort to control the rising costs of workers compensation insurance 
the effect of this restructuring was a shift of the significant portion of the financial risk associated with claims losses from the insurance company to our company  while the insurance company bears only the financial risk of large individual losses and large aggregate losses 
as a result of the shift to a self insurance retention policy  we must estimate the amount that we will ultimately pay for losses associated with workers compensation claims  or claims losses for the policy period 
these estimated claims losses must be recorded as expense during the policy period 
claims losses can vary substantially and  because they can take years to develop fully  can be difficult to estimate 
these estimates are based on complex judgments regarding the probable number of claims that will be filed and the nature of those claims 
both of those variables are highly uncertain and combine to form a factor referred to as the loss pick 
the loss pick factor is multiplied by our payroll cost to determine what the projected costs for claims and our related expense will be 
we estimate the loss pick by reviewing a minimum of five years of our historical claims loss data and analyzing the trend of the development of claims over time 
we also review and adjust the loss pick for other major factors such as the risk control environment and claims handling 
the risk control environment includes proper safety training  safe working environment  availability of safety equipment for specific tasks and management emphasis and monitoring of safe practices 
claims handling includes proper reporting of claims  proper care given to injured employees  availability of return to work programs  and oversight of the claims process by both the insurance claims handler and our own management 
we review our loss pick on a quarterly basis considering the current loss trend and any changes in the environment as indicated above 
the loss pick is then applied to our actual payroll costs to estimate the claims loss portion of our workers compensation expense for the given period 
our insurance carrier required us to pre fund claims losses at a loss pick of for the policy year ending september  and gave us a maximum loss pick of  above which the carrier is responsible for paying all claims 
for the policy year ending september   we are required to pre fund claims losses at a loss pick of and have a maximum loss pick of 
the ranges set forth by the insurance carrier reflect the most probable potentials for our workers compensation claims losses 
the increase in the insurance carriers range reflects the trend over the last several years toward increasing workers compensation costs 
based on these ranges  and the factors described above  we chose a loss pick of for the policy year ended september  and for the policy year ending september  the decrease in our loss pick reflects the implementation of programs to reduce the risks in our operating environment and the improving trends in our historical claims losses 

table of contents the following table reflects the ranges for the loss picks and the loss picks used by us in the estimate of our workers compensation costs in thousands probable expense range estimated expense payroll recorded low end high end policy year ended september  loss pick percentage calculated loss pick in dollars premiums and other fees total workers compensation expense policy year ending september  months of a month policy loss pick percentage calculated loss pick in dollars premiums and other fees total workers compensation expense we recognize workers compensation expense in direct costs and selling  general and administrative expense of our segments  based on their respective payroll cost and the loss pick percentage discussed and shown above  to calculate the claims loss portion of the expense 
the difference between the minimum amount of claims losses pre funded to the insurance carrier and the amount expensed is accrued and included in other liabilities 
if our estimates prove to be incorrect as the losses develop over several years  we will either have to pay additional claims losses or will receive a refund from our insurance carrier 
this could result in a need for us to recognize additional expense or have expense reduced in future periods within the range shown above 
the insurance policies in place for and prior years did not have large deductibles and we have accrued for the maximum possible expense under these policies 
impairment of goodwill our goodwill represents the purchase price paid and liabilities assumed for animal hospital and laboratory acquisitions in excess of the fair market value of the net tangible assets acquired 
the total amount of our net goodwill at december  was million  consisting of million for our laboratory operating segment and million for our animal hospital operating segment 
on january   we implemented statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
with that implementation  we began an annual process of estimating the fair market value of our laboratory and animal hospital operating segments and comparing that estimated fair market value against the net book value of those operating segments  as reflected in our financial statements  to determine if our goodwill is fairly stated or if its value is impaired 
if the estimated fair value of our operating segments exceeds their net book value  there is no impact to our financial position  the results of our operations or our liquidity 
if the estimated fair value of our operating segments is less than the net book value  then we have to recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the net book value of our goodwill and the operating segment at its estimated fair market value 
this impairment loss would be recognized in our earnings in the period the estimate 
table of contents was made  however  there would be no related cash impact 
because the impairment loss would be a non cash event  it would not trigger a default on our debt covenants 
upon adoption of sfas no 
and as of december  the estimated fair market value of our operating segments exceeded their net book value 
as a result  we concluded that the value of our goodwill was fairly stated 
fair market valuations 
in the estimation process  we may use valuations of the fair market value of our laboratory and animal hospital operating segments 
independent valuation experts  or in house individuals possessing the appropriate skill and knowledge  prepare the valuations 
there are two approaches used in conducting a fair market valuation  a market based approach and a discounted cash flow approach 
the estimated fair market value we used for our reporting units is a blending of these approaches 
these approaches also serve as a reasonableness check against each other 
the market based approach uses the enterprise value of selected publicly traded companies that are similar to each operating segment to estimate the operating segment s fair market value 
the similarities include but are not limited to business structure and nature of service provided 
the enterprise value of comparable companies equals the sum of their stock price times the total number of diluted shares and the fair market value of their outstanding debt 
the enterprise value is then used to create specific valuation multiples of ebitda that can be applied to each operating segment 
in our valuation process  five to ten comparable companies were used to create ranges for specific valuation multiples that were then used to estimate the enterprise value of each operating segment 
different companies could have been reasonably selected  however  we do not feel that a different selection would have a material impact on the results of the test 
in the future  the enterprise value of the companies selected may change dramatically based on changes in their stock price and fair market value of their debt 
historically  the stock market has shown volatility and over the last year the stock price of many companies has decreased substantially 
if this trend continues  it may have a material impact on the valuation of our operating segments and the value of our goodwill 
the enterprise value of the comparable companies is based on the current stock price for those companies as they are being traded under normal circumstances 
any attempt to purchase all of the common stock would result in a dramatic increase in the price of those shares 
this increase is known as the control premium  and it represents the premium that would have to be paid to take control of the business in the open market 
in the fair market valuations  a control premium is applied to the enterprise value to arrive at the estimated fair market value 
the control premium is estimated based on actual control premiums used for comparable companies who are involved with or have recently completed an acquisition process 
while the control premium is based on actual control premiums paid in recent acquisitions of comparable companies  a different control premium could have been reasonably selected in our valuation process 
based on the comparable companies  the range of reasonable premiums was  from which was used in our valuation process 
we do not feel that different premiums would have had a material impact on our valuation process 
in the future  the control premium may decrease based on market conditions which could have a material impact on the results of our valuation process 
the discounted cash flow approach estimates the projected aggregate sum of future net cash flows generated by each operating segment 
the aggregate net cash flows are discounted for time value of money and risk 
the time value of money reflects the fact that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future 
the risk factor reflects the risk that our operating segments may not generate the future net cash flows that we are projecting for a variety of reasons as discussed in the risk factors section included herein 
the time value of money and the risk factor combine to form a discount rate that is used for discounting the future projected net cash flow of each operating segment 
both the projected net cash flows of our operating segments and the discount rate used involve the use of estimates and assumptions 
while different estimates and assumptions could have been reasonably made in the valuation process  we do not believe that they would have had a material impact on the results of the process 
in the future  these factors may change based on changes in our operating performance and or operating environment 
review for impairment 
we had an independent valuation expert estimate the fair market value of our laboratory and animal hospital operating segments as of january  at december   we had an independent valuation expert estimate the fair market value of our animal hospital operating segment  while we 
table of contents performed an internal assessment that concluded that the fair market value of the laboratory operating segment exceeded the value of its net book assets 
the results of this work showed that the value of our net goodwill was fairly stated in our financial statements and that there are currently no impairment issues 
we did not perform a valuation of our laboratory operating segment as december  based on management s assessment that the fair market value of the operating segment exceeded the value of its net book assets 
this assessment was based on the large margin between the laboratory s estimated fair market value at january  and the net book value of its assets at that time and the fact that there were no significant subsequent changes in the laboratory s operations or operating environment 
we had an independent valuation expert estimate the fair market value of the animal hospital operating segment at december  because we acquired animal hospitals during that resulted in an increase of million in the net value of our goodwill 
there were no other significant changes in the animal hospital s operations or operating environment 
at december  the net book value of our laboratory operating segment was million and the net book value of our animal hospital operating segment was million 
the following tables reflect the results of the valuations used in our goodwill impairment reviews as of january  and december  and the significant estimates made in that process dollars in millions market based approach ebitda control valuation estimated multiple ebit multiple premium date value range range range used laboratory january  x x x x animal hospital january  x x x x december  x x x x discounted cash flow approach valuation estimated growth rate discount rate date value range range range laboratory january  animal hospital january  december  the decrease in the animal hospital operating segment estimated value range from january  to december  under the market based approach reflects the decrease in the stock price of comparable companies that occurred in while the decrease was significant  the valuation still exceeded the net book value of the assets by a large margin 
the stock price of the comparable companies for the laboratory operating segment also decreased significantly  in  however the impact of the decrease on the valuation model would not have resulted in an impairment of our goodwill 
we will review our goodwill for impairment again at december  or upon material changes in our operating environment 
we do not anticipate that there will be significant changes in our operations and or operating environments in the year to come other than possible acquisitions 
legal settlements we are a party to various legal proceedings 
although we cannot determine the ultimate disposition of these proceedings  we can use judgment to reasonably estimate our liability for legal settlement costs that may arise 
table of contents as a result of these proceedings 
based on our prior experience  the nature of the current proceedings including the settlement payment for the zoasis litigation  and our insurance policy coverage for such matters  we have accrued million as of december  for legal settlements as part of other accrued liabilities 
we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  but we cannot assure that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves 
similarly  although we believe that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs  we cannot assure that we will be able to do so 
allowance for uncollectible accounts provision for uncollectible accounts is estimated based primarily upon age of accounts receivable 
accounts receivable balances are routinely reviewed in conjunction with collection efforts  historical collection rates and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectibility of accounts when considering the adequacy of the amounts recorded as allowance for uncollectible accounts 
significant changes in client mix or economic conditions could affect our collection of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations 
income taxes we make estimates in recording our provision for income taxes  including our determination of deferred tax assets  deferred tax liabilities and any valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset 
we operate in multiple states with varying tax laws 
our federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through our fiscal year  which resulted in no adjustment to our financial statements 
we must make estimates to determine that tax reserves are adequate to cover any future  potential audit adjustments

laboratory revenue and requisitions generated from internal growth  as referred to in the above table  have been adjusted to exclude revenue and requisitions for newly acquired laboratories  those laboratories that we did not own for the entire periods presented 
the increases in requisitions from internal growth in and in are the result of a trend within the veterinarian community where there is a continued growing emphasis on the importance of diagnostic testing 
in addition  our marketing programs include comprehensive education to our clients  which have contributed to the growth in our revenue in both volume and breadth of tests performed 
the increases in the average revenue per requisition in and are attributable to our sales and marketing efforts of our pet health and wellness programs  which have contributed to an increase in the number of tests performed per requisition  as well as a change in the mix of tests to more comprehensive and expensive tests 
also contributing to our increases in average revenue per requisition are price increases 
the prices of most tests were increased to in february and to in february as the result of acquiring a laboratory in november  we generated an additional  of revenue referred to in the above table as acquired revenue during the year ended december  in comparison to the prior year 
in march we acquired a laboratory  which added  of acquired revenue during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the billing day adjustment  referred to in the above table  reflects the impact of one additional billing day for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the billing adjustment reflects the impact of two less billing days for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year

the combined revenue of animal hospitals owned and managed increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which increased million compared to the year ended december  the increases in combined revenue of animal hospitals owned and managed was attributable to several factors as discussed below and summarized in the following table for the years ended december  and in thousands  except average price per order comparative analysis comparative analysis animal hospital revenue change change adjusted same facility revenue orders average price per order total adjusted same facility revenue net acquired revenue combined animal hospitals owned and managed adjusted same facility revenue and orders and net acquired revenue are measures for combined animal hospitals owned and managed and are reconciled to the gaap based measures in tables below 
computed by dividing adjusted same facility revenue by adjusted same facility orders 
numbers may not recalculate exactly due to rounding 
over the last few years there has been a shift in the sale point of pet related retail products from animal hospitals to supermarkets  large pet product stores and other distribution channels 
in anticipation of this migration  our animal hospital segment has placed a greater emphasis on providing high quality veterinary care and wellness programs and has focused less on retail oriented transactions 
these changes have contributed to the decreases in the total orders  the increases in the average price per order and the increases in adjusted same facility revenue for the years ended december  and net acquired revenue for the comparative analysis represents revenue from hospitals acquired  sold or closed on or subsequent to january  net acquired revenue for the comparative analysis represents revenue from hospitals acquired  sold or closed on or subsequent to january  discussions in medical literature suggest that small animals may not require as many or as frequent vaccinations as is currently accepted practice 
any reduction in the number of visits to our hospitals resulting from less frequent vaccinations will negatively impact our ability to continue to achieve adjusted same facility revenue growth rates consistent with our current levels 

table of contents reconciliation between non gaap and gaap based measures in the above tables  we use non gaap measures to reflect the total performance of animal hospitals owned and managed

the increase in adjusted corporate sg a as a percentage of total revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in corporate bonuses and legal expense 

table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for the years ended december  and include the amortization of goodwill and executive non competition agreements 
commencing january   we no longer amortize goodwill as a result of adopting sfas no 
following the closing of our initial public offering in november  we terminated the executive non competition agreements

this extraordinary loss consisted primarily of the write off of deferred financing costs 
on october   we borrowed million in principal amount of additional senior term c notes and we used these proceeds along with cash on hand to voluntarily repay the remaining principal balance of million of our senior subordinated notes and million in principal amount of our senior notes 
in conjunction with that transaction  we recorded an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of million that provided a related income tax benefit of million 
this extraordinary loss consisted primarily of the write off of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and the payment of related transaction and redemption fees 
related party transactions we believe  based on our reasonable judgment  but without further investigation  that the terms of each of the following transactions or arrangements between us and our affiliates  officers  directors or stockholders which were parties to the transactions were  on an overall basis  at least as favorable to us as could then have been obtained from unrelated parties 
investments in and transactions with zoasis corporation during  we made a million investment in zoasis corporation  an internet start up business  majority owned by robert antin  our chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
in december  we determined that the value of this investment was impaired and  as a result  recognized a loss of million on the write down of our investment in zoasis corporation

we initially used an independent outside contractor to begin programming this software but now intend to use an in house programmer working in conjunction with zoasis corporation 
zoasis corporation will not be paid for this programming effort but will be able to use and amend the software to market it to other veterinary hospitals and laboratories 
in relation to this project  zoasis corporation is also working with us to facilitate the collection and delivery of laboratory results to our clients

liquidity and capital resources discussion of our cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease resulted primarily from million provided by operating activities offset by million used in investing activities and million used in financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue  a reduction in direct costs as a percentage of revenue and changes in working capital that contributed to an increase in cash flow 
in addition  we paid million in related to the termination of a management services agreement that was not paid in these factors were offset by a million increase in selling  general and administrative expense  a million increase in interest paid and a million increase in taxes paid

future cash requirements we expect to fund our liquidity needs primarily from operating cash flows  cash on hand and  if needed  borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  but this amount has been repaid and no amounts under our revolving credit facility are outstanding as of the date of this report 
we believe these sources of funds will be sufficient to continue our operations and planned capital expenditures and satisfy our scheduled principal and interest payments under debt and capital lease obligations for at least the next twelve months 
however  a significant portion of our cash requirements will be determined by the pace and size of our acquisitions 
estimated future uses of cash in include capital expenditures for land  buildings and equipment of approximately million 
in addition  we intend to use available liquidity to continue our growth through the selective acquisition of animal hospitals primarily for cash 
we continue to examine acquisition opportunities in the laboratory field  which may impose additional cash requirements 
our acquisition program contemplates the acquisition of to animal hospitals per year and a planned cash commitment of up to million 
however  we may purchase either fewer or greater number of facilities depending upon opportunities that present themselves and our cash requirements may change accordingly 
in addition  although we intend to primarily use cash in our acquisitions  we may use debt or stock to the extent we deem it appropriate 
in addition to the foregoing  we will use approximately million of cash in to pay the mandatory principal payments due on our outstanding indebtedness 
description of indebtedness senior term notes and revolving credit facility on september   we entered into a credit and guaranty agreement for million of senior secured credit facilities  which included a million revolving credit facility as well as senior term a and b notes 
in subsequent transactions we repaid million in principal amount of the senior term a and b notes in connection with our initial public offering on november   repaid the entire principal balance of the senior term a and b notes on august  by issuing new senior term c notes  which bear a lower interest rate than the weighted average interest rate for the senior term a and senior term b notes  borrowed million in principal amount of additional senior term c notes under the credit and guaranty agreement on october  to voluntarily repay other debt obligations as discussed below  and borrowed million on our revolving credit facility for general working capital needs in december 
table of contents at december   we had million principal amount outstanding under our senior term c notes and million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we repaid the million outstanding on our revolving credit facility by february borrowings under the credit and guaranty agreement bear interest  at our option  on either the base rate  which is the higher of the administrative agent s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  or the adjusted eurodollar rate  which is the rate per annum obtained by dividing the rate of interest offered to the administrative agent on the london interbank market by a percentage equal to minus the stated maximum rate of all reserve requirements applicable to any member bank of the federal reserve system in respect of eurocurrency liabilities 
the base rate margins for the revolving credit facility range from to per annum and the margin for the senior term c notes is 
the eurodollar rate margins for the revolving credit facility range from to per annum and the margin for the senior term c notes is 
the senior term c notes mature in september and the revolving credit facility matures in september the credit and guaranty agreement contains certain financial covenants pertaining to interest coverage  fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios 
in addition  the credit and guaranty agreement has restrictions pertaining to capital expenditures  acquisitions and the payment of dividends on all classes of stock 
we currently believe the most restrictive covenant is the fixed charge coverage ratio  which is calculated on a last twelve month basis by dividing pro forma adjusted ebitda by fixed charges 
fixed charges are defined as cash interest expense  scheduled principal payments on debt obligations  capital expenditures  management fees paid and provision for income taxes 
at december   we had a fixed charge coverage ratio of to 
the credit and guaranty agreement requires a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than to 
pro forma adjusted ebitda would have to decrease by for us to be out of compliance with our fixed charge coverage ratio requirement at december  senior subordinated notes on november   vicar operating  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  issued million in principal amount of senior subordinated notes due december   which were exchanged on june  for substantially similar securities that are registered under the securities act 
interest on these senior subordinated notes is per annum  payable semi annually in arrears in cash 
as of december   the outstanding principal balance of these senior subordinated notes was million 
we and each existing and future domestic wholly owned subsidiary of vicar have jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally guaranteed these notes 
these guarantees are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness outstanding under the credit and guaranty agreement and any other indebtedness permitted to be incurred by vicar under the terms of the indenture agreement governing these notes 
senior notes on february   we used approximately million of the net proceeds received from our secondary offering to redeem the entire principal amount of our senior notes due at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
other debt we had seller notes secured by assets of animal hospitals and unsecured debt that total million at december

requires that losses resulting from early extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary only if they are unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence 
we do not believe these losses on extinguishment of debt are unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence as we have and will continue to adjust our capital structure to take advantage of current economic conditions 
as a result  we will reclassify the gross loss before income tax benefit on extinguishment of debt from extraordinary losses to a component of income from recurring operations as a unique item below operating income in future filings 
this reclassification will not impact net income 
in addition to the extraordinary losses detailed above  we will incur approximately million  before tax benefit  in early debt redemption costs during the first quarter of related to redeeming the entire principal amount of our senior notes on february  these costs will be recorded as a component of income from recurring operations as a unique item below operating income

table of contents new accounting pronouncements goodwill and other intangible assets in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
sfas no 
requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever there is an indication of impairment 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires companies to allocate their goodwill to identifiable reporting units  which are then tested for impairment using a two step process detailed in the statement 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if that fair value exceeds the carrying amount  the second step of the process is not necessary and there are no impairment issues 
if that fair value does not exceed that carrying amount  companies must perform the second step that requires a hypothetical allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities as if the unit were just purchased by the company at the fair value price 
in this hypothetical purchase  the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its re evaluated  marked to market net assets would be the new basis for the reporting unit s goodwill and a write down to this new value would be recognized as an expense 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  in doing so  we determined that we have two reporting units  laboratory and animal hospital 
on april   an independent valuation group concluded that the fair value of our reporting units at january  exceeded their carrying value and accordingly  as of that date  and as of december   we concluded that our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives were fairly valued 
see critical accounting policies for further information 
as of december  our goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  was million 
we recorded million and million in goodwill amortization for the years ended december  and  respectively 
because of the adoption of sfas no 
there was no amortization of goodwill for the year ended december  asset retirement obligations in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no

to have a material impact on our financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets in august  the fasb issued sfas no

apb no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  without material impact on our financial statements 
we will continually evaluate whether events  circumstances or net losses at the entity level have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of these assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that these assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  we will estimate the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long lived assets in question 
if that estimate is less than the carrying value of the assets under review  we will recognize an impairment loss equal to that difference

under sfas no 
 gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria of apb no 
under apb no 
 events are considered extraordinary only if they possess a high degree of abnormality and are not likely to recur in the foreseeable future 
any gains or losses on extinguishment of debt that do not meet the criteria of apb no 
shall be classified as a component of income from recurring operations 
in addition  any gains or losses on extinguishment of debt that were classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that do not meet the criteria of apb no 
shall be reclassified as a component of income from recurring operations 
we recognized extraordinary losses related to the early extinguishment of debt  before taxes  of approximately million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we do not believe these losses on extinguishment of debt meet the criteria of apb no 
as we have historically changed our capital structure to take advantage of current market conditions 
as a result  we will reclassify the gross loss before tax benefit on extinguishment of debt from extraordinary losses to a component of income from recurring operations as a unique item below operating income for all periods presented effective for all filings subsequent to january  this reclassification will not impact net income loss 
in addition to the extraordinary losses detailed above  we will incur approximately million  before tax benefit  in early debt redemption costs during the first quarter of related to redeeming the entire principal amount of our senior notes on february  these costs will be recorded as a component of income from recurring operations as a unique item below operating income 
sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
under sfas no 
 if a capital lease is modified such that it becomes an operating lease  a gain or loss must be recognized similar to the accounting used for sale leaseback transactions as provided in sfas no

at december   we had no capital lease obligations 
although we may enter into capital leases in the future  we do not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when a company is committed to future payment of those liabilities under a binding  legal obligation 
sfas no 
nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  which required that exit and disposal costs be recognized as liabilities when a company formalized its plan for exiting or disposing of an activity even if no legal obligation had been established 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   however early adoption is encouraged 
currently  we have no plans to exit or dispose of any of our business activities that would require the use of sfas no 
nor do we anticipate that sfas no 
will change any of our business practices 
accounting for stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  as prescribed under sfas no 
in addition  sfas no 
requires prominent disclosure in the footnotes to both annual and interim financial statements about our method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of our method on reported results 
we do not plan to adopt the fair value accounting model for stock based employee compensation at this time  accordingly  sfas no 
will not have an impact on

revenue laboratory animal hospital other intercompany total revenue operating income loss net income loss although not readily detectable because of the impact of acquisitions  our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuation 
in particular  our revenue historically has been greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
the demand for our veterinary services is significantly higher during warmer months because pets spend a greater amount of time outdoors  where they are more likely to be injured and are more susceptible to disease and parasites 
in addition  use of veterinary services may be affected by levels of infestation of fleas  heartworms and ticks and the number of daylight hours 
a substantial portion of our costs are fixed and do not vary with the level of demand 
consequently  our ebitda  adjusted ebitda and operating income  as well as our ebitda margin  adjusted ebitda margin and operating margins  generally have been higher for the second and third quarters than that experienced in the first and fourth quarters

the risks  uncertainties and assumptions referred to above include difficulty of managing our growth and integrating our new acquisitions and other risks that are described from time to time in our securities and exchange commission reports  including but not limited to the items discussed below 

table of contents if we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy  we may not achieve our desired economics of scale and our margins and profitability may decline 
our success depends in part on our ability to build on our position as a leading animal health care services company through a balanced program of internal growth initiatives and selective acquisitions of established animal hospitals and laboratories 
if we cannot implement or effectively execute these initiatives and acquisitions  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
even if we effectively implement our growth strategy  we may not achieve the economies of scale that we have experienced in the past or that we anticipate having in the future 
our internal growth rate may decline and could become negative 
our laboratory internal revenue growth has fluctuated between and for each fiscal year from through similarly  our animal hospital adjusted same facility revenue growth rate has fluctuated between and over the same fiscal years 
our internal growth may continue to fluctuate and may be below our historical rates 
any reductions in the rate of our internal growth may cause our revenues and margins to decrease 
our historical growth rates and margins are not necessarily indicative of future results 
our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to manage our growth effectively 
since january   we have experienced rapid growth and expansion 
our failure to manage our growth effectively may increase our costs of operations and hinder our ability to execute our business strategy 
our rapid growth has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management and operational systems and resources 
at january   we operated animal hospitals  operated laboratories servicing approximately  customers in states and had approximately  full time equivalent employees 
at december   we operated animal hospitals  operated laboratories servicing approximately  customers in all states and had approximately  full time equivalent employees 
if our business continues to grow  we will need to improve and enhance our overall financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures  and expand  train and manage our workforce in order to maintain control of expense and achieve desirable economies of scale 
we also will need to increase the capacity of our current systems to meet additional demands 
due to the fixed cost nature of our business  fluctuations in our revenue could adversely affect our operating income 
approximately of our expense  particularly rent and personnel costs  are fixed costs and are based in part on expectations of revenue 
we may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any significant fluctuations in our revenue 
accordingly  shortfalls in revenue may adversely affect our operating income 
difficulties integrating new acquisitions may impose substantial costs and cause other problems for us 
our success depends on our ability to timely and cost effectively acquire  and integrate into our business  additional animal hospitals and laboratories 
any difficulties in the integration process may result in increased expense  loss of customers and a decline in profitability 
we expect to acquire to animal hospitals per year  however  based on the opportunity  the number could be higher 
historically we have experienced delays and increased costs in integrating some hospitals primarily where we acquire a large number of hospitals in a single region at or about the same time 
in these cases  our field management may spend a predominant amount of time integrating these new hospitals and less time managing our existing hospitals in those regions 
during these periods  there may be less attention directed to marketing efforts or staffing issues 
in these circumstances  we also have experienced delays in converting the systems of acquired hospitals into our systems  which results in increased payroll expense to collect our results and delays in reporting our results  both for a particular region and on a consolidated basis 
these factors have resulted in decreased revenue  increased costs and lower margins 
we continue to face risks in connection with our acquisitions including negative effects on our operating results  impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets  
table of contents dependence on retention  hiring and training of key personnel  including specialists  and contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of  and other unanticipated problems arising in  an acquired business 
the process of integration may require a disproportionate amount of the time and attention of our management  which may distract management s attention from its day to day responsibilities 
in addition  any interruption or deterioration in service resulting from an acquisition may result in a customer s decision to stop using us 
for these reasons  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition  either at all or in a timely manner 
if that happens and we incur significant costs  it could have a material adverse impact on our business 
the carrying value of our goodwill could be subject to impairment write downs 
at december   our balance sheet reflected million of goodwill  which is a substantial portion of our total assets of million at that date 
we expect that the aggregate amount of goodwill on our balance sheet will increase as a result of future acquisitions 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that suggest that the fair market value of each of our reporting units exceeds their carrying values 
if we determine that the fair market value of one of our reporting units is less than its carrying value  this may result in an impairment write down of the goodwill for that reporting unit 
the impairment write down would be reflected as expense and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations during the period in which we recognize the expense 
in  we concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value and accordingly  as of that date  our net goodwill was fairly stated in our financial statements and there are currently no impairment issues 
however  in the future we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded or arising out of future acquisitions 
we require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and expand our business as planned 
we have  and will continue to have  a substantial amount of debt 
our substantial amount of debt requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to pay down our indebtedness and related interest  thereby reducing the funds available to use for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
at december   our debt  excluding unamortized discount  consisted primarily of million in principal amount outstanding under our senior credit facility  million in principal amount outstanding under our senior notes and senior subordinated notes  and million in principal amount outstanding under our other debt 
the following table sets forth the scheduled principal and interest payments that are due on our debt for each of the years indicated  adjusted to reflect the impact of the voluntary repayment of the entire principal amount of the senior notes  which occurred on february  in connection with our secondary offering in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt fixed interest variable interest swap agreement 
table of contents we have both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the interest payments on our variable rate debt are based on a variable rate component plus a fixed 
including the fixed  we estimate that the total interest rate on our variable rate debt will be     and for years through  respectively 
see footnote  long term obligations  of our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these variable rate notes 
on november  we entered into a no fee swap agreement with wells fargo bank effective november  and expiring november  the agreement swaps monthly variable libor rates for a fixed rate of on a notional amount of million 
the agreement qualifies for hedge accounting 
our ability to make payments on our debt  and to fund acquisitions  will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future 
insufficient cash flow could place us at risk of default under our debt agreements or could prevent us from expanding our business as planned 
our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations  our strategy to increase operating efficiencies may not be realized and future borrowings may not be available to us under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
in order to meet our debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt 
we may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our debt instruments may adversely affect our ability to run our business 
our substantial amount of debt  as well as the guarantees of our subsidiaries and the security interests in our assets and those of our subsidiaries  could impair our ability to operate our business effectively and may limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities 
for example  our indenture and senior credit facility limit our funds available to repay the senior subordinated notes  limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to obtain other financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments and general corporate purposes  limit our ability to dispose of our assets  create liens on our assets or to extend credit  make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business or industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors with less debt  and restrict our ability to pay dividends  repurchase or redeem our capital stock or debt  or merge or consolidate with another entity 
the terms of our indenture and senior credit facility allow us  under specified conditions  to incur further indebtedness  which would heighten the foregoing risks 
if compliance with our debt obligations materially hinders our ability to operate our business and adapt to changing industry conditions  we may lose market share  our revenue may decline and our operating results may suffer 
our failure to satisfy covenants in our debt instruments will cause a default under those instruments 
in addition to imposing restrictions on our business and operations  our debt instruments include a number of covenants relating to financial ratios and tests 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
the breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under these instruments 
an event of default would permit our lenders and other debtholders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable  together with accrued and 
table of contents unpaid interest 
moreover  these lenders and other debtholders would have the option to terminate any obligation to make further extensions of credit under these instruments 
if we are unable to repay debt to our senior lenders  these lenders and other debtholders could proceed against our assets 
the significant competition in the companion animal health care services industry could cause us to reduce prices or lose market share 
the companion animal health care services industry is highly competitive with few barriers to entry 
to compete successfully  we may be required to reduce prices  increase our operating costs or take other measures that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  margins and cash flow 
if we are unable to compete successfully  we may lose market share 
there are many clinical laboratory companies that provide a broad range of laboratory testing services in the same markets we service 
our largest competitor for outsourced laboratory testing services is idexx laboratories  inc  which currently competes or intends to compete in most of the same markets in which we operate 
also  idexx and several other national companies provide on site diagnostic equipment that allows veterinarians to perform their own laboratory tests 
our primary competitors for our animal hospitals in most markets are individual practitioners or small  regional  multi clinic practices 
also  regional pet care companies and some national companies  including operators of super stores  are developing multi regional networks of animal hospitals in markets in which we operate 
historically  when a competing animal hospital opens in close proximity to one of our hospitals  we have reduced prices  expanded our facility  retained additional qualified personnel  increased our marketing efforts or taken other actions designed to retain and expand our client base 
as a result  our revenue may decline and our costs increase 
we may experience difficulties hiring skilled veterinarians due to shortages that could disrupt our business 
as the pet population continues to grow  the need for skilled veterinarians continues to increase 
if we are unable to retain an adequate number of skilled veterinarians  we may lose customers  our revenue may decline and we may need to sell or close animal hospitals 
as of december   there were veterinary schools in the country accredited by the american veterinary medical association 
these schools graduate approximately  veterinarians per year 
there is a shortage of skilled veterinarians across the country  particularly in some regional markets in which we operate animal hospitals including northern california 
during these shortages in these regions  we may be unable to hire enough qualified veterinarians to adequately staff our animal hospitals  in which event we may lose market share and our revenues and profitability may decline 
if we fail to comply with governmental regulations applicable to our business  various governmental agencies may impose fines  institute litigation or preclude us from operating in certain states 
the laws of many states prohibit business corporations from providing  or holding themselves out as providers of  veterinary medical care 
these laws vary from state to state and are enforced by the courts and by regulatory authorities with broad discretion 
as of december  we operated animal hospitals in states with these laws  including in new york 
we may experience difficulty in expanding our operations into other states with similar laws 
given varying and uncertain interpretations of the veterinary laws of each state  we may not be in compliance with restrictions on the corporate practice of veterinary medicine in all states 
a determination that we are in violation of applicable restrictions on the practice of veterinary medicine in any state in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on us  particularly if we were unable to restructure our operations to comply with the requirements of that state 
all of the states in which we operate impose various registration requirements 
to fulfill these requirements  we have registered each of our facilities with appropriate governmental agencies and  where required  have appointed a licensed veterinarian to act on behalf of each facility 
all veterinarians practicing in our clinics are required to maintain valid state licenses to practice 

table of contents any failure in our information technology systems or disruption in our transportation network could significantly increase testing turn around time  reduce our production capacity and otherwise disrupt our operations 
our laboratory operations depend  in part  on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems and transportation network 
our growth has necessitated continued expansion and upgrade of our information technology systems and transportation network 
sustained system failures or interruption in our transportation network or in one or more of our laboratory operations could disrupt our ability to process laboratory requisitions  perform testing  provide test results in a timely manner and or bill the appropriate party 
we could lose customers and revenue as a result of a system or transportation network failure 
our computer systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources  including telecommunications failures  electricity brownouts or blackouts  malicious human acts and natural disasters 
moreover  despite network security measures  some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electrical break ins  computer viruses and similar disruptive problems 
despite the precautions we have taken  unanticipated problems affecting our systems could cause interruptions in our information technology systems 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures in our systems 
in addition  over time we have significantly customized the computer systems in our laboratory business 
we rely on a limited number of employees to upgrade and maintain these systems 
if we were to lose the services of some or all of these employees  it may be time consuming for new employees to become familiar with our systems  and we may experience disruptions in service during these periods 
any substantial reduction in the number of available flights or delays in the departure of flights  whether as a result of severe weather conditions  as we recently experienced in the eastern united states  a terrorist attack or any other type of disruption  will disrupt our transportation network and our ability to provide test results in a timely manner 
in addition  our test express service  which services customers outside of major metropolitan areas  is dependent on flight services in and out of memphis and the transportation network of federal express 
any sustained interruption in either flight services in memphis or the transportation network of federal express would result in increased turn around time for the reporting of test results to customers serviced by our test express service 
the loss of mr 
robert antin  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  could materially and adversely affect our business 
we are dependent upon the management and leadership of our chairman  president and chief executive officer  robert antin 
we have an employment contract with mr 
antin which may be terminated at the option of mr 
antin 
we do not maintain any key man life insurance coverage for mr 
antin 
the loss of mr 
antin could materially adversely affect our business 
concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers  directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders are able to significantly affect our management  our policies and all matters requiring stockholder approval 
the directors supported by these stockholders will be able to significantly affect decisions relating to our capital structure  including decisions to issue additional capital stock  implement stock repurchase programs and in our indebtedness 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers  delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management  or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 

table of contents the war with iraq  other political events and the uncertainty resulting from them may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
the war with iraq  the terrorist attacks which took place in the united states on september   along with the united states military campaign against terrorism  ongoing violence in the middle east and the increasing instability in north korea have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may affect the markets in which we operate  our operations and profitability and your investment 
the potential near term and long term effect that the war with iraq and possible terrorist and other attacks may have for our customers  the markets for our services and the us economy are uncertain 
the consequences of any terrorist attacks  or other armed conflicts are unpredictable and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our markets  our business or your investment 
item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had borrowings of million under our senior credit facility with fluctuating interest rates based on market benchmarks such as libor 
to reduce the risk of increasing interest rates  we entered into a no fee interest rate swap agreement on november  effective november  and expiring november  under the swap agreement we receive payments equal to the annual libor rate times million in exchange for paying a fixed annual rate of times million 
the swap agreement has the effect of reducing the amount of our debt exposed to variable interest rates from million to million 
accordingly  for the year ending december   for every increase in the libor rate we will pay an additional million in interest expense and for every decrease in the libor rate we will save million in interest expense 
we are considering entering into additional interest rate strategies to take advantage of the current rate environment 
we have not yet determined what those strategies may be or their possible impact
