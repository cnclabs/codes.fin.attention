overview icos corporation and subsidiaries  herein collectively referred to as icos  is a product driven company that has expertise in both protein based and small molecule therapeutics 
we combine our capabilities in molecular  cellular and structural biology  high throughput drug screening  medicinal chemistry and gene expression profiling to develop highly innovative products expected to have significant commercial potential 
we apply our integrated approach to erectile dysfunction and other urologic disorders  sepsis  psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases 
we believe our strategy of targeting multiple therapeutic areas with drugs that act through distinct molecular mechanisms increases our chances of successfully developing commercial products 
we have established collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to enhance our internal development capabilities and to offset a substantial portion of the financial risk of developing our product candidates 
at the same time  we maintain substantial rights to the product candidates covered by 
table of contents these collaborations  which provide us the opportunity to participate in a significant portion of the potential economic benefit from successful development and commercialization 
our most significant ongoing collaboration partners include lilly and biogen 
approved product cialis european markets in november  lilly icos received approval from the european commission to market cialis  for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
lilly icos began shipping cialis to european wholesalers in january  and cialis is now available  by prescription  in pharmacies across europe 
product candidates in clinical development cialis in june  lilly icos submitted an nda to the fda seeking marketing approval of cialis for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
in april  lilly icos received an approvable letter from the fda indicating the fda is prepared to approve the application upon the satisfaction of conditions specified in the letter 
those conditions are the successful completion of clinical pharmacology studies  labeling discussions  and successful resolution of matters related to lilly s manufacturing facilities 
a us regulatory decision for cialis is projected to occur in the second half of  with product launch anticipated to occur shortly after approval 
lilly is pursuing approval of cialis for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in markets outside of the european union and north america under an exclusive license from lilly icos 
in those countries  lilly will market cialis and pay a royalty  equal to of net sales  to lilly icos 
in addition  lilly icos has initiated a phase clinical program evaluating tadalafil for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis 
ic in july  we entered into an agreement with biogen to jointly develop and co promote ic and other lfa antagonists as oral therapeutics for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
ic is an orally administered  small molecule antagonist that we are currently evaluating for the treatment of psoriasis 
in the third quarter of  we began a phase clinical trial evaluating ic for patients with psoriasis 
rtx in november  we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to rtx for the treatment of bladder disease or function 
rtx is a small molecule that can be delivered to the bladder to desensitize afferent nerve fibers  which are believed to play a role in many pathological conditions of the bladder 
we are initially evaluating rtx as a treatment for interstitial cystitis  a chronic condition often associated with bladder pain  urinary urgency and high frequency of urination  including at night 
in january  we began a phase clinical trial evaluating rtx for patients with interstitial cystitis 
ic ic is a monoclonal antibody that we are currently evaluating in a phase clinical trial as a treatment for sepsis resulting from cap 
ic ic is an orally administered  small molecule pde inhibitor 
we completed phase clinical trials for ic in the third quarter of  and expect to initiate a phase clinical trial in for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 

table of contents endothelin receptor antagonists sitaxsentan completed a phase b clinical trial in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension in the fourth quarter of in january  we announced our conclusion that joint development of the endothelin receptor antagonist program  through icos tbc  should not continue 
we and texas biotechnology are currently negotiating the terms pursuant to which texas biotechnology might independently continue the endothelin receptor antagonist program 
pafase in december  the pafase development program was terminated after an interim analysis did not demonstrate clinical benefit in a phase study for severe sepsis 
results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates we recognize revenue from our contracts for research and development services  including those under collaborative agreements cost reimbursement revenue  as the related costs are incurred 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue over the appropriate future performance periods 
nonrefundable upfront technology license fees  for product candidates where we are providing continuing services related to product development  are deferred 
we recognize these fees as revenue over the estimated product development periods  based on estimated total future development costs 
milestones earned  in the form of additional license fees  are recognized as revenue at the time such payments are due  based on the ratio of cumulative costs incurred to date  to total estimated development costs 
any remaining balance is deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated remaining product development period 
contract manufacturing revenue  including fees earned for process development and manufacturing services performed for third parties  is recognized as revenue when services are provided and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize as licenses of technology is dependent upon our estimates of total product development costs as well as the timing of such costs over the estimated development period 
as product candidates move through the development process  it is necessary to revise these estimates to consider changes to the products development cycle  such as changes in the clinical development plan  regulatory requirements  or various other factors  many of which may be outside of our control 
the impact on revenue of changes in our estimates of total product development costs and the timing thereof  is recognized prospectively  over the remaining estimated product development period 
we recognize our share of the operating results of our unconsolidated affiliates in proportion to our ownership interest in the affiliate and report it as equity in losses of affiliates 
losses relating to our affiliates are recognized only to the extent we have made  or are committed to make  capital contributions to the affiliate 
operating results of our affiliates include expenses related to research  development  marketing and sales services that we provide to them  and that we recognize as cost reimbursement revenue 
the amount of our cost reimbursement revenue  and the associated costs  both depend on the continued progression of clinical trial and development activities  the timing and amount of marketing and sales activities  and our level of participation in those activities 
a shift of research  development and co promotional activities among collaboration partners could have a significant impact on our overall operating results to the extent that our negotiated reimbursement rates include indirect and overhead costs that may not vary based on our collaboration activities 
also  a shift of such activities could have a material impact on our costs and expenses and the consequent amount of our cost reimbursement revenue 
for example  the shift of development activities from icos to our affiliate partner would be expected to result in our reporting lower revenue and lower operating expenses 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
table of contents statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
modifications to these assumptions could result in estimates that are substantially different from those reflected in the financial statements 
research and certain clinical trial activities are conducted by various third parties  including contract research organizations  which may also provide contractually defined administration and management services 
we recognize expenses for these contracted activities based on a variety of factors  including actual and estimated labor hours  clinical site initiation activities  patient enrollment rates  estimates of external costs  and other activity based factors 
on a regular basis  our estimates of these costs are reconciled to actual invoices from the service providers and adjustments are made accordingly 
general our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period 
operating results will depend on  among other factors  the timing of expenses  continued funding from our collaboration partners  and the timing and progress of our research  development  marketing and sales activities 
we may experience significant fluctuations in cost reimbursement revenue  revenue from licenses of technology and contract manufacturing revenue 
revenue from licenses of technology will vary as a result of the timing of milestone payments and changes in estimated total development costs  which depend on the success of clinical trials and other development efforts 
contract manufacturing revenue may fluctuate depending upon our needs to manufacture our own internal product candidates and our ability to attract third parties to utilize any remaining manufacturing capacity 
in addition  significant changes in collaboration activities could cause the amount of affiliate losses to fluctuate from period to period 
our collaboration activities are subject to the oversight of both parties 
accordingly  the clinical  development  marketing and sales activities of our affiliates are not entirely within our control 
we have incurred significant operating losses since we began operations in september as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our operating expenses have been increasing during the past several years and are expected to increase during and  possibly  thereafter  as we attempt to complete development of our potential product candidates  obtain necessary regulatory approvals and manufacture and market these product candidates 
directly and through lilly icos  we expect to incur substantial marketing and other costs related to commercializing cialis in europe and  to complete development  obtain expected regulatory approval and launch cialis in the united states 
we also expect to continue to incur substantial costs under our collaborative agreement with biogen 
in the future  we may pursue our internal research  development  marketing and sales activities more aggressively and  when beneficial to do so  establish additional collaborations 
as a result of these factors  we currently do not expect to achieve profitability for at least two to three years 
securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
in the fourth quarter of  we adopted the provisions of the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 as amended sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
pursuant to sab  nonrefundable upfront technology license fees  for product candidates where we are providing continuing services related to product development  are deferred 
we recognize these fees as revenue over the estimated product development periods  based on estimated total future development costs 
milestones  in the form of additional technology license fees  are recognized as revenue at the time such payments are due  based on the ratio of cumulative costs incurred to date  to total estimated development costs 
any remaining balance is deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated remaining product development period 
previously  milestones were recognized as revenue upon attainment of a specified event  and nonrefundable upfront technology license fees were recognized as revenue when received 
our results for the year include a million charge per share representing the cumulative effect of adopting sab effective january  this charge reflects the aggregate amount of license fees and milestone payments that we reported as revenue in years prior to  to be recognized as revenue in and future years under sab during   and  we recognized  as revenue  million  million and million  respectively  of the million deferred in as a result of a change in accounting for certain revenues 

table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december   was million compared to million for the year ended december  cost reimbursement revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost reimbursement revenue primarily reflects manufacturing activities and patient enrollment in the phase clinical trial with pafase for severe sepsis  prior to the december decision to discontinue the pafase program 
the increase also includes the impact of the phase b clinical trial with sitaxsentan for pulmonary arterial hypertension  which was concluded in late these increases were partially offset by a decline in cost reimbursement revenue related to cialis  primarily due to the completion  in  of development activities required to file the nda 
revenue from icos clinical partners  lp icos clinical partners also declined  as funding under the related services agreement ended in early revenue from licenses of technology was million in  compared to million in revenue for the period included million of a million license fee payment received from lilly icos following submission of the nda for cialis in june during and  we recognized  as revenue  million and million  respectively of the million deferred in as a result of a change in accounting for certain revenues 
the decrease in was primarily due to the completion  in  of development activities required to file the nda for cialis  partially offset by million of previously deferred  nonrefundable license fees that were recognized as revenue in the fourth quarter of upon the decision to terminate the pafase program 
contract manufacturing revenue was million in  compared to million in the prior year 
we began our contract manufacturing program in the fourth quarter of operating expenses research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of costs associated with conducting basic research  clinical trials for our product candidates and other costs incurred in support of those activities 
research and development expense was million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to higher patient enrollment in the phase clinical trial with pafase for severe sepsis and costs associated with pafase manufacturing activities 
the increase also reflects development activities related to other clinical product candidates ic  ic  ic and sitaxsentan  and increased spending on discovery and preclinical research activities 
research and development costs for cialis decreased during  primarily due to the completion of certain activities in  prior to the nda filing 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of costs associated with corporate support functions  general management and other activities not directly related to research and development efforts 
general and administrative expense increased million  to million in this increase primarily reflects start up costs incurred during the first half of in anticipation of the us commercial launch of cialis and an increase in market research activities 
equity in losses of affiliates in  we recognized million in losses related to our equity interests in affiliates  compared to million in our share of lilly icos losses increased million  to million in this increase reflects higher lilly icos sales and marketing costs  in anticipation of the commercial launch of cialis in the us and europe  and higher research and development costs associated with seeking regulatory approval in the us and other countries 
our share of suncos losses increased million  to million in  reflecting incremental clinical and manufacturing development activities for pafase  prior to the decision  in december  to discontinue the pafase program 
upon discontinuation of the program  suncos accrued million of estimated close out costs  consisting primarily of expenses associated with the termination of clinical studies and manufacturing activities 
our share of icos tbc losses decreased to 
table of contents million in  compared to million in in  we recognized million in losses associated with a milestone payment to texas biotechnology upon the achievement of a clinical objective 
interest and other income interest and other income totaled million in  compared to million in interest and other income in reflects the impact of an increase in our average invested funds  due to the net proceeds of our november equity financing  largely offset by substantially lower interest rates 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december   was million compared to million for the year ended december  cost reimbursement revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost reimbursement revenue primarily related to the pafase phase clinical trial for severe sepsis and the sitaxsentan phase b clinical trial for pulmonary arterial hypertension 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by a decline in cost reimbursement revenue related to cialis  as certain clinical activities were completed prior to the submission of the nda to the fda in june revenue from icos clinical partners also declined  as funding under the related services agreement ended in the first quarter of revenue from licenses of technology was million in  compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the completion of cialis development activities required to file the nda earlier in and the substantially greater proportion of estimated total product development costs incurred in revenue from licenses of technology for included million of a million license fee received from lilly icos following the submission of the cialis nda to the fda in june during  we also recognized million of the million deferred in as a result of a change in accounting for certain revenues 
during  we recognized million in revenue related to the development and manufacture of third party clinical materials  compared to million in the prior year 
we began offering contract manufacturing services in the fourth quarter of operating expenses research and development 
research and development expense was million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the progression of development activities for pafase  sitaxsentan  and early stage product candidates tbc  ic and ic these increases were partially offset by lower development costs for cialis 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased to million in  compared to million in this increase reflects growth of our corporate marketing and sales functions and other expenditures to support the anticipated commercial launch of cialis 
equity in losses of affiliates we recognized million of affiliate losses in  compared to million in this increase is primarily due to our share of operating losses of lilly icos  which we began recognizing in the third quarter of the increase also reflects higher operating losses from suncos and icos tbc due to the progression of development activities for pafase  sitaxsentan and tbc interest and other income interest and other income totaled million in  compared to million for this increase was primarily due to higher average invested balances in  from the net proceeds of our december and november equity financings  offset by the impact of lower interest rates 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  investment securities available for sale and interest receivable of million  compared to million at december  we used million in cash for operating activities during compared to million during the change in operating cash flow primarily reflects the receipt of a million license fee from lilly icos in june  receipt of an million upfront payment from biogen in july  timing of vendor payments and cost reimbursements from our affiliates and an overall increase in research and development and general and administrative spending in we used million in cash for investing activities during compared to million in cash for investing activities during cash used in investing activities in included a million net increase in our investment portfolio  compared to a million net increase in our investment portfolio in the increase in our investment portfolio in both years primarily reflects our conversion of cash equivalents held at the end of the prior year into investments with slightly longer maturities 
agreements with our affiliates obligate us to fund a portion of the development and commercialization activities of the relevant collaboration 
we generally fund these obligations in the form of capital contributions to the affiliate 
investing outflows in included million of affiliate capital contributions  compared to million of affiliate capital contributions in the increase in affiliate capital contributions reflects increased research and development spending by certain of the affiliates and the timing of partner expense reimbursements 
none of our affiliates have any third party indebtedness 
each affiliates liabilities are principally payable to its owners for reimbursable research  development  sales  marketing or other expenses 
we generated million in cash from financing activities in  compared to million in proceeds from stock options and warrants totaled million in  for million shares of our common stock  compared to million in  for million shares of our common stock 
the and proceeds included million and million  respectively  from the exercise of series a warrants to purchase million and million shares  respectively  of our common stock 
the series a warrants were issued in  exercisable at and per share and  if unexercised  expired on may  financing cash inflows during also included million in borrowings under our line of credit with biogen  of which million was forgiven upon the achievement of a clinical milestone in financing cash inflows during included million in borrowings under our line of credit with biogen  all of which was forgiven in upon the achievement of a clinical milestone 
some or all future loans from biogen  of up to an additional million as of december   may also be forgiven upon the achievement of development milestones 
cash inflows from financing activities in also included million in net proceeds received from our november public offering of million shares of common stock at per share 
our future cash requirements will depend on various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including obtaining regulatory approval for cialis in the us  canada and mexico  and continued progress in commercializing cialis in europe  the us and elsewhere  funding levels for research and development programs  including continued funding from our collaboration partners  the results of clinical trials and preclinical studies  the time and costs involved in filing and prosecuting patents and enforcing and defending patent claims  the regulatory process in the us and other countries  acquisitions of products or technologies  if any  relationships with research and development collaborators  capital contributions to our affiliates  
table of contents competing technological and market development activities  and the time and costs of manufacturing  scale up and commercialization activities 
we have engaged in collaborations and joint development agreements with other parties where the capabilities and strategies of the other parties complement ours 
although corporate collaborations  partnerships and joint ventures have provided cost reimbursement revenue to us in the past  we cannot assure you that this type of revenue will be available to us in the future 
substantially all of our cost reimbursement revenue to date has been for reimbursement of the cost of research and development services that we provided 
in the future  collaborative revenue is also expected to include reimbursement of the cost of marketing and sales services we expect to provide related to product commercialization 
we intend to expand our operations and hire the additional personnel necessary to commercialize cialis and continue development of our current portfolio of product candidates in clinical trials  as well as to continue discovery and preclinical research to identify additional product candidates 
we also intend to continue to engage in pre marketing activities necessary to bring our product candidates to market and to establish marketing and selling capabilities for product candidates ready for commercialization 
we anticipate that expansion of these activities will increase operating expenses in the future 
furthermore  we will need to make incremental expenditures for additional laboratory  production and office facilities to accommodate the activities and personnel associated with these increased development and commercialization efforts 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents  investment securities  interest income from our investments  cash flow from other operating activities  including anticipated payments from lilly icos  cash flow from potential future collaborations  and the line of credit available to us under an agreement with biogen  will be sufficient to fund operations for approximately two years 
however  given our product development and marketing and sales efforts  including those associated with the recent commercial launch of cialis in europe  and the anticipated commercial launch of cialis in the us and other countries  there is a reasonable likelihood that we will seek additional financing during the next year or so 
additional financing may not be available when we need it or may be unavailable on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures for some of our development programs or grant rights to third parties to develop and market product candidates that we would prefer to develop and market on our own 
our operating cash flows include the effect of certain noncancelable obligations 
we lease certain property and equipment under operating leases which  in the aggregate  obligate us through future minimum payments due under noncancelable operating leases  as of december   are as follows thereafter we have entered into various licensing and research and development arrangements under which we may be obligated to make future payments to third parties upon the achievement of certain success based objectives 
in connection with our acquisition of technology rights to certain pde inhibitors  including cialis tadalafil  we committed to pay a third party a royalty equal to of the net sales of products developed utilizing the acquired technology 
lilly icos and lilly have accepted primary responsibility for any royalty obligations resulting from icos previous arrangement 

table of contents new accounting standard in november  the financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force issued its consensus concerning revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses how to determine whether a revenue arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting  and  if separation is appropriate  how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the identified accounting units 
the guidance in eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not anticipate that adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
legal proceedings on october   pfizer inc  pfizer limited  and pfizer ireland pharmaceuticals filed a patent infringement lawsuit against icos  lilly icos  and lilly in the united states district court for the district of delaware 
the complaint alleges that the intended and imminent use  offering for sale  selling  manufacture  or importing into the united states upon fda approval of cialis for the treatment of erectile dysfunction by icos  lilly icos and lilly will constitute infringement of plaintiffs us patent no 
 which issued on october  the plaintiffs seek a judgment declaring that the defendants using  selling  offering for sale  making or importing of cialis for the treatment of erectile dysfunction will infringe this patent 
the plaintiffs also seek a permanent injunction  attorneys fees  costs and expenses 
on january   we filed an answer denying the central allegations of plaintiffs complaint and setting forth various affirmative defenses 
litigation is inherently unpredictable and the eventual outcome in a particular case is impossible to determine in advance 
we believe that pfizer s suit lacks merit and intend to vigorously pursue our various defenses 
if pfizer were to prevail  however  we might be subject to substantial damages  prohibited from marketing cialis for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in the united states  or required to enter into a licensing agreement to market cialis in the united states 
any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk at december  and  our financial instruments consist principally of cash  cash equivalents and marketable investment securities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our marketable investment securities 
because of the relatively short maturities of our investments  we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to materially affect the aggregate value of our financial instruments
