critical accounting policies and estimates 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in its annual report on form k 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in its annual report on form k 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its financial statements 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations property  fixtures and equipment property  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is computed on the straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives buildings and building improvements to years furniture and fixtures years equipment to years leasehold improvements to years the company s accounting policies regarding property  fixtures and equipment include certain management judgments and projections regarding the estimated useful lives of these assets and what constitutes increasing the value and useful life of existing assets 
these estimates  judgments and projections may produce materially different amounts of depreciation expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
impairment of long lived assets the company assesses the potential impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  on an annual basis  the company reviews the recoverability of goodwill 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the total future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the carrying amount is written down to the estimated fair value  and a loss resulting from value impairment is recognized by a charge to earnings 
judgments and estimates made by the company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets are affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as the company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets  these factors could cause the company to realize a material impairment charge 
insurance reserves the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses under its workers compensation  general liability  health and property insurance programs 
the company purchases insurance for individual claims that exceed the amounts listed in the following table workers compensation general liability health property damage the company records a liability for all unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims at the anticipated cost to the company based on estimates provided by a third party administrator and insurance company

unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense that would be reported under these programs

outlook the following discussion of the company s future operating results and expansion strategy and other statements in this report that are not historical statements constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements represent the company s expectations or belief concerning future events and may be identified by words such as believes  anticipates  expects  plans  should and similar expressions 
the company s forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statement 
we have endeavored to identify the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statements in the section entitled cautionary statement on pages and future operating results as of the date of this report substantial uncertainty exists as to the strength of consumer spending as a result of the economic downturn and conflict in the middle east 
the company s revenue growth expectations summarized in the following paragraph assume that current spending trends do not worsen during the company s revenues and financial results in could vary significantly depending upon consumer and business spending trends 
revenue 
the company plans to grow revenues in by opening additional restaurants and increasing comparable store sales and average unit volumes in all brands 
the company s expansion plans are summarized in this section 
based upon current economic conditions  the company is currently planning for average unit volumes for outback steakhouse to increase by approximately to during compared with at present  the company is not planning on any price increases during for outback steakhouse

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future operating results continued cost of sales 
the company is anticipating favorable pork rib and beef pricing versus and has also entered into contracts to secure its butter and cheese supplies for all of at a price that is slightly favorable to the average price in cost of sales is also expected to decrease in as new format restaurants are developed that have a lower cost of sales as compared with outback and carrabba s 
cost of sales is expected to decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales in as a result of price increases taken in the latter part of the company expects the favorable commodities and brand mix to be partially offset by unfavorable potato and onion pricing 
although the total change in food cost is subject to several factors  such as the mix of new restaurants  commodity availability and usage and price fluctuations in commodities for which the company does not have purchase contracts  the current expectation for the company is for a decrease of approximately to of sales for the full year 
labor costs 
during the last few years  the company has experienced significant wage pressure resulting from a tight labor market 
the company expects this pressure to ease in as the labor market softens 
the company expects that as more of the new format restaurants roy s  fleming s and lee roy selmon s are opened  that consolidated labor costs as a percentage of consolidated restaurant sales will increase because the labor costs as a percentage of sales at the new restaurant formats run at a higher rate than at outback and carrabba s 
in addition  higher employee health insurance cost will also continue the upward pressure on labor costs as a percentage of restaurant sales 
as a result  the company is currently planning for its labor costs to increase by to of restaurant sales during restaurant operating expenses 
the company plans to increase its advertising expenditures as a percent of sales in both outback steakhouse and carrabba s italian grill in in addition  costs incurred prior to the opening of new restaurants are expected to increase as a result of additional restaurant openings in versus these preopening expenses total approximately  for each company owned and joint venture outback steakhouse  approximately  for each carrabba s italian grill  approximately  for each bonefish grill  and approximately  for each new roy s and fleming s prime steakhouse and wine bar 
restaurant operating expense ratios may vary materially from quarter to quarter depending on when new units open 
as a result of the additional advertising expenditures and increase in planned openings of new restaurants  restaurant operating expenses may increase in by to of restaurant sales

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement continued the company s actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statements included in the discussion of future operating results and expansion strategy and elsewhere in this report as a result  among other things  of the following i the restaurant industry is a highly competitive industry with many well established competitors  ii the company s results can be impacted by changes in consumer tastes and the level of consumer acceptance of the company s restaurant concepts  local  regional and national economic conditions  the seasonality of the company s business  demographic trends  traffic patterns  consumer perception of food safety  employee availability  the cost of advertising and media  government actions and policies  inflation  and increases in various costs  iii the company s ability to expand is dependent upon various factors such as the availability of attractive sites for new restaurants  ability to obtain appropriate real estate sites at acceptable prices  ability to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis  impact of government moratoriums or approval processes  which could result in significant delays  ability to obtain all necessary contractors and subcontractors  union activities such as picketing and hand billing which could delay construction  the ability to generate or borrow funds  the ability to negotiate suitable lease terms and the ability to recruit and train skilled management and restaurant employees  iv price and availability of commodities  including  but not limited to  items such as beef  chicken  shrimp  pork  seafood  dairy  potatoes  onions and energy costs are subject to fluctuation and could increase or decrease more than the company expects  and or v weather and other acts of god could result in construction delays and also adversely affect the results of one or more stores for an indeterminate amount of time 
insurance the company purchases insurance for individual claims that exceed the amounts listed in the following table workers compensation general liability health property damage the company records a liability for all unresolved claims at the anticipated cost to the company at the end of the period based on the estimates provided by a third party administrator and insurance company 
impact of inflation the company has not operated in a highly inflationary period and does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on sales or expenses during the last three years other than labor costs 
the company s restaurant operations are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws governing such matters as working conditions  overtime and tip credits 
significant numbers of the company s food service and preparation personnel are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage and  accordingly  increases in the minimum wage have increased the company s labor costs in the last two years 
to the extent permitted by competition  the company has mitigated increased costs by increasing menu prices and may continue to do so if deemed necessary in future years 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in commodity prices 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates to its  revolving lines of credit with its banks 
borrowings under the agreements bear interest at rates ranging from to basis points over the   or london interbank offered rate 
at december  and  the company had a  outstanding balance on the lines of credit 
the weighted average effective interest rate on the  outstanding balance was at december  the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates primarily to its direct investment in restaurants in korea  hong kong  the philippines and brazil and to its royalties from international franchisees in countries 
the company does not use financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate changes 
many of the food products purchased by the company and its franchisees are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to unpredictable price volatility 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
the purchase arrangement may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain floors and caps
