iv 
critical accounting policies introduction in preparing the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  judgments and estimates are made about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
as part of the financial reporting process  the company s management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base judgments and develop estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
historical experience and available information is used to make these judgments and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in the financial statements 
in addition to the significant accounting policies described in note of the consolidated financial statements  the company believes that the following discussion addresses its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for hotline services when title transfers at the time of shipment 
for its structured cabling and telephony services  the company recognizes revenues on short term projects generally projects with a duration of less than one month as the projects are completed and invoiced to the client 
revenues from long term projects projects with a duration of greater than one month  generally two to four months are recognized according to the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  income is recognized based on a ratio of estimated costs incurred to total estimated contract costs 
losses  if any  on such contracts are provided in full when they become known 
billing in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are classified as current liabilities and any costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings are classified as current assets 
accounting for judgment and estimates the company establishes reserves when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
reserves by their nature relate to uncertainties that require exercise of judgment both in accessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating any amount of potential loss 
the most important areas of judgment and estimates affecting the company s financial statements include accounts receivable collectibility  inventory valuation  pending litigation and the realization of deferred tax assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its clients to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain clients estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire client pool 
if the financial condition of the company s clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory reserves the company writes down its inventory to the lower of cost or market  which includes an estimate for obsolescence or excess inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
upon a subsequent sale or disposal of the impaired inventory  the corresponding reserve for impaired value is relieved to ensure that the cost basis of the inventory reflects any write downs 
deferred tax valuation allowances should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be expensed in the period such determination was made 
long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include technological advances  changes in the company s business model  capital strategy  economic conditions or operating performance 
the company s evaluation is based upon  among other things  assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  the company would recognize an impairment loss 
the company continually applies its best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
changes in management s judgments and estimates could significantly affect the company s analysis of the impairment of goodwill 
to test goodwill for impairment  the company is required to estimate the fair value of each of its reporting units 
since quoted market prices in an active market are not available for the company s reporting units  the company uses other valuation techniques 
the models used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units include an earning model and a discounted cash flow valuation model 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates the company s estimates of future cash flows  allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units  future growth rates and management s judgment regarding the applicable discount rates to use to discount those estimated cash flows 
the company has  of goodwill as of march  and changes to the judgments and estimates used in the models could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
restructuring the company accrues the cost of restructuring activities in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance depending upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the situation 
the company exercises its judgment in estimating the total costs of each of these activities 
as these activities are implemented  the actual costs may differ from the estimated costs due to changes in the facts and circumstances that were not foreseen at the time of the initial cost accrual
