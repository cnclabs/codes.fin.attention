item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
under the terms of various of our skincare license agreements  licensees are responsible for developing new products and applications  and gaining product approvals based upon the technologies and patents covered by the licenses 
we expect research and development spending for our sexual dysfunction products to increase significantly as we progress with the mutual recognition procedure mrp in europe and prepare for discussions with the us fda  regarding the number and scope of invicorp clinical trials in the us in this connection  we are working with quintiles  a leading provider of information  technology and services to the pharmaceuticals industry  to support our efforts in bringing invicorp to market in europe and in the us as efficiently as possible 
we are currently working with the danish medicines agency on the mrp process and with the medicines 
table of contents control agency in the united kingdom on an invicorp ampoule product and have commenced work for the reactivation of our investigational new drug approval with the fda in the us 
after completion of their assessment work on the updated clinical and pharmaceutical dossiers  assuming satisfactory results  the danish medicines agency is expected to progress the mrp filings and we are hopeful of receiving additional european union approvals during the first quarter of we anticipate spending up to  in on this research and development  including costs related to the granting of the european union marketing approvals for our invicorp product 
additionally  we are attempting to develop strategic relationships with companies that can help us share in the cost of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals and market the product 
overall  we expect future research and development spending to increase as we develop our pipeline of proprietary technology 
the company expects  however  a portion of these expenses to be absorbed by its existing and future commercial partners 
manufacturing and marketing marketing consistent with our strategy of building a high margin revenue stream  all of our current revenues are derived from license agreements under which our licensees assume responsibility for marketing and maintaining required government approvals within their respective licensed territories 
we expect to maintain this business model in the case of emerging products in our skincare segment  where achieving acceptable distribution is dependent upon a broad based sales and distribution network within the particular class of trade 
in addition  we plan to introduce our own proprietary kinetin plus line in direct to consumers  spas and salons 
we anticipate spending approximately  on the test marketing of these products 
marketing expenditures could increase significantly if the company s product line is well received 
in the case of invicorp and its associated delivery systems  we are currently reviewing whether to undertake sales and distribution directly or through an alliance with a company with appropriate sales and distribution infrastructure 
should we opt to realize the potential profits of direct distribution to urologists and other specialists or to retailers that fulfill such professionals prescriptions  significant expenditures will be required to establish and operate the necessary infrastructure 
should we opt to establish an alliance with a company having an established retailing and distribution network in a particular market  we will seek to subsidize ongoing marketing approval expense through co development arrangements and to realize revenues through licensing fees and royalties or other participation in the third party s sales or through shared equity or other joint venture arrangements 
manufacturing certain of our existing licenses for core products in the skincare segment grant our licensees the right to manufacture covered products 
in the case of those licenses which grant only marketing rights or require the licensee to produce and package product from senetek supplied bulk  we contract with third parties for the manufacture and or filling and labeling of the skincare products covered by such licenses 
while we rely on particular suppliers for the raw materials and componentry used in the manufacture of such products we do not anticipate any problems with supply of such materials 
we have licensed a third party to manufacture and sell our various non core consumer products  as well as the cell lines licensed to us for production of monoclonal antibodies 
with regard to our ed medication  invicorp  the active ingredients  vip and pms are currently available from suppliers in quantities believed to be adequate for the company s requirements following marketing approval in europe 
these suppliers have developed synthetic production methods that are included in the product marketing application updates with regulatory authorities in europe 
we believe that  should these suppliers become unavailable or unable to supply in required volumes  alternative sources of approvable supplies are available 

table of contents as of december  we had approximately million of fixed assets in progress for the manufacture of reliaject components and the subsequent filling and assembly of the reliaject system 
these assets were initially purchased in and we expect them to be commercially deployed within the next months 
we anticipate that an additional spending of approximately  will be required to bring these assets into commercial use 
invicorp is currently approved in three countries and on an ongoing basis we are reviewing potential partners for marketing and distribution arrangements for invicorp in europe 
since we cannot assure that we will be successful in securing an arrangement that will meet our return on investment roi criteria  we are also developing an alternative plan for marketing and distributing invicorp on our own 
running in parallel to our regulatory and pre marketing efforts in europe  we have finalized consolidating our manufacturing equipment for the production of reliaject in napa  california 
our plans are to manufacture the reliaject components ourselves or lease or sell the equipment to an experienced device manufacturer while securing the exclusive rights for reliaject for our core markets of erectile dysfunction and anaphylaxis 
during the third quarter of  we commissioned an independent study to determine the fair value of the exclusive manufacturing rights of the reliaject autoinjector system with an established firm of valuation advisors 
they have formed the opinion that the fair value of these rights is in the range of to million 
the market assumptions in the valuation model were based on invicorp gaining approval under the european mutual recognition process in the third quarter of and making estimates of invicorp in reliaject sales in accordance with market research data 
obtaining regulatory approvals throughout the european union represents a key prerequisite to securing collaborative partners or customers 
should we not be successful in gaining european union approvals  operating the manufacturing equipment for production of reliaject components ourselves or in leasing the equipment to a third party or its outright sale  we could be required by accounting rules to write down all or part of the carrying value of this asset in progress 
such a write down could have a material adverse impact on future net income 
we believe that future cash flows will exceed the carrying value of the asset 
competition the bulk of our current revenues are derived from licenses to manufacture and or market products containing our patented kinetin ingredient  with smaller amounts being derived from agreements for the manufacture and sale of non core skincare and consumer products and cell lines for the production of monoclonal antibodies used in research 
while our patents and patent licenses currently protect us from competition from sales of products within the specific scope of our patents and license rights  many companies are engaged in the development and marketing of products competitive with our patented and licensed products 
regarding our ed products  all necessary governmental marketing approvals have not yet been obtained 
assuming they are obtained we will compete with many other companies having established products in the marketplace including pharmacia upjohn  schwarz pharma  and vivus  having developed caverject and edex and muse respectively 
we believe invicorp offers advantages over these therapies including a favorable side effect profile  high level of efficacy in organic ed  natural erection and termination  and shorter time to onset 
pfizer  inc with its viagra product controls the bulk of the oral therapy market  which currently represents in excess of of the worldwide ed market 
we consider invicorp to be complimentary rather than competitive to the oral therapy market as it addresses the needs of patients for whom the oral therapies are not effective or well tolerated 
the biopharmaceutical  pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries are highly competitive 
we compete and will continue to compete with research and development programs at biotechnology  biopharmaceutical  pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical companies  as well as academic institutions  government agencies and public and private organizations throughout the world 
virtually all of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources and name recognition than do we and are better equipped to research  develop  patent  conduct pre clinical testing and human clinical trials  manufacture  and market products 
these companies have the capability and resources to develop or acquire and market products that compete with our existing and planned products  and the timing of the market introduction of our own and our competitors products will be important competitive factors affecting our future results 

table of contents we cannot predict the extent to which any of the products we are currently developing  including invicorp and its delivery vehicles  will become commercially viable 
assuming that invicorp and related delivery vehicles are approved for sale in the additional territories in which approvals are currently being sought  we believe that competition will be based  among other things  on product efficacy  ease of administration  convenience  speed of onset  price and third party reimbursement 
regarding our future viability  our competitive position also depends upon our ability to contract for effective and productive research and attract and retain qualified personnel to develop and effectively exploit the results of such research 
we expect competition to intensify in all fields in which we are involved 
government regulation general the research  pre clinical development  clinical trials  manufacturing and marketing of the products comprising our pharmaceuticals segment are subject to extensive regulation  including pre marketing approval requirements  of the fda and equivalent foreign regulatory agencies 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
many products ultimately do not reach the market because of toxicity or lack of effectiveness as demonstrated by required testing 
furthermore  regulatory agencies may suspend clinical trials at any time if it is believed that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks 
in addition  there can be no assurance that this regulatory framework will not change or that additional regulations will not arise at any stage during product development that may affect approval  delay an application  or require additional expenditures 
accordingly  we cannot assure that clinical trials related to any products currently in development by us will be completed successfully within any specified time period  if at all  or that pre marketing approvals based on such trials will be granted 
while the business comprising our existing skincare segment generally is not subject to pre marketing approval  various statutes and regulatory restrictions apply to this business in the united states and most other countries 
product approval united states in the united states  the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health service act govern the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our pharmaceuticals 
the steps required before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory testing  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application which must become effective before human clinical trials may be commenced  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  submission of a new drug application to the fda  and fda approval of the new drug application prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
clinical trials of new pharmaceuticals in humans are designed to establish both the safety and the efficacy of the pharmaceutical in treating a particular disease or condition 
these studies are usually conducted in three phases of testing 
in phase i  a small number of volunteers is given the new compound in order to identify toxicities and characterize the compound s behavior in humans 
in phase ii  small numbers of patients with the targeted disease are given the compound to test its efficacy in treating the targeted disease and to establish dose levels 
phase iii studies are large scale studies designed to confirm a compound s efficacy for the targeted disease and identify toxicities that might not have been seen in smaller studies 
once adequate data have been 
table of contents obtained in clinical testing to demonstrate that the compound is both safe and effective for the intended use  all available data is submitted to the fda as part of the new drug application 
invicorp has received investigational new drug approval from the fda  and we intend to pursue clinical trials and the filing of a new drug application with the fda for invicorp following completion of pre marketing approvals in europe 
current fda regulations govern the manufacture  labeling  advertising and marketing of certain non pharmaceutical products covered by the federal food  drug and cosmetics act  which are required to obtain pre market approval if they do not fall within the parameters of fda issued monographs 
currently  such regulations do not apply to non monograph products  such as kinetin  though the fda does regulate issues such as labeling and has the power to seize such products found to be adulterated 
however  there can be no assurance that the federal food  drug and cosmetics act or the regulations thereunder will not be changed so as to subject non monograph products to increased regulation 
product approval other countries marketing of pharmaceutical products in other countries requires regulatory approval from the notified bodies in each particular country 
the current approval process varies from country to country  and the time to approval may vary from that required for fda approval  although the review of clinical studies by regulatory agencies in foreign jurisdictions to establish the safety and efficacy of the product generally follows a similar process to that in the united states 
similarly  non pharmaceutical products generally are not subject to pre marketing approval requirements in foreign countries although they are regulated in a manner similar to the united states and  in the case of certain countries such as japan  such products may require reformulation to remove ingredients not considered acceptable by the particular country 
invicorp was approved for marketing in denmark in july in june the new zealand medicines assessment advisory committee granted a marketing authorization approval for invicorp in new zealand 
in october  the united kingdom medicines control agency granted a marketing authorization for invicorp in the united kingdom  where it is currently sold to physicians for prescribing on a named patient basis 
an application for marketing authorization approvals under the european mutual recognition procedure has been initiated  with denmark being selected as the reference member state 
during  we will be evaluating and processing marketing authorization applications for up to other european union member states 
depending on the cost and timing of the approved process  we could spend up to  in on research and development for invicorp 
while we anticipate that invicorp will be approved for marketing in at least the majority of countries participating in the european mutual recognition procedure  no assurance can be given that such approvals will be granted  or that such approvals  if granted  will not contain significant limitations in the form of warnings  precautions or contraindications with respect to condition of use 
any delay in obtaining  or failure to obtain  such approvals would adversely affect the revenues anticipated from our pharmaceuticals segment 
post approval the marketing and manufacture of pharmaceutical products are subject to post approval regulatory review  and later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in the regulatory agencies requiring further clinical research or imposing restrictions on the product or the manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
additionally  any adverse reactions or events involving such products must be reported to these agencies 
previously unidentified adverse events or an increased frequency of adverse events occurring post approval could result in labeling modifications  additional contraindications and other restrictions that could adversely affect future marketability 
ultimately  marketing approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if a product is found to present an unacceptable risk 
any such restriction  suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents third party reimbursement we believe that the availability of third party reimbursement of all or a portion of the cost of invicorp therapy may affect the overall marketability of invicorp and its related delivery systems 
in the united states  government funded and private insurance programs reimburse or pay directly the cost of many medical treatments  prescription drugs and medical devices 
the us health care financing administration hcfa sets reimbursement policy for the medicare program in the united states  and has established a national coverage policy for the diagnosis and treatment of ed in medicare beneficiaries 
private insurance coverage for ed treatment  however  varies widely across the united states  and the introduction and popularity of pfizer s viagra resulted in some plans establishing broad coverage exclusions for ed treatment 
as viagra is an oral therapy and therefore in a different usage category  we believe that such coverage exclusions will not apply to invicorp 
outside of the united states  most third party reimbursement programs are governmentally funded 
in some countries  no reimbursement currently is made for ed therapy  while other countries limit the amount of reimbursement or require that ed treatment be related to specified other medical conditions 
in addition  in certain european countries  the sales price of a product must be approved 
the pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted 
restrictions on the pricing of invicorp could adversely affect the profitability of the pharmaceuticals segment 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  trademarks and confidentiality agreements to protect our business interests 
we believe that patents are of material importance to the success of our royalty driven business model and that trademarks are also of significance  particularly within our skincare segment 
our policy is to file patent applications to protect inventions and improvements considered important to the development of our business in the principal countries where protection from manufacture or marketing of infringing products is commercially warranted 
typically  us patents expire years after the grant date and foreign patents expire up to years after filing of the patent application 
as of december  we hold approximately issued patents  including patents for invicorp for the use of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and phentolamine mesylate in the treatment of ed  granted in countries and pending in fifteen other countries  patents for kinetin and zeatin for ameliorating the effects of aging on skin  granted in countries and pending in nine other countries  patents for kinetin and zeatin for ameliorating the effects of hyperproliferative skin diseases  including psoriasis  granted in countries and pending in one other country  and autoinjector patents for the delivery of therapeutic ingredients  granted in countries and pending in eight other countries 
in january we were granted a patent in one country for cytokinins including kinetin in the treatment of inflammatory diseases 
it is noted  however  that patents  including those for pharmaceuticals and skincare ingredients  generally involve complex legal and factual issues 
in the united states  for example  the first person to conceive and document a novel invention is generally entitled to patent it  even if another person who subsequently conceived the invention was the first person to file a patent application on it 
this issue of priority of invention is further complicated by the fact that patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until a patent is issued or denied  generally years after filing 
accordingly  a patent holder may be subject to interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office pto long after the patent was issued based upon another party s claim of earlier invention 
furthermore  as only novel inventions are patentable  a patent holder may be subject to proceedings in the pto or in federal court attacking the validity of the patent based on alleged obviousness or so called prior art  or based on alleged improprieties in prosecuting the patent in the pto 
issues of novelty and abuse of patent also arise under the laws of most foreign countries in which we hold patents or have filed patent applications 
we have successfully defended against claims of invalidity and unenforceability of our kinetin patents see legal proceedings 
however  while we believe that our patents are valid and enforceable  there can be no assurance that if  in the future  we must enforce any one or more of our 
table of contents patents  or such patents are challenged by a third party  such patents ultimately would be upheld 
similarly  while we believe that our products do not infringe the valid claims of any third party s patents  there can be no assurance that we would prevail if a third party sought to enforce its patent against us by a suit for an injunction or damages 
interference and similar proceedings in the pto or equivalent foreign patent offices  whether brought by us to protect our patents or brought by a third party challenging such patents  are time consuming  disruptive of management and highly costly  and injunctive and other patent litigation in court is likely to be many times more time consuming  disruptive and costly 
furthermore  in the united states unlike many foreign countries a party generally is not entitled to reimbursement of its legal fees and expenses even if it is wholly successful in its prosecution or defense  so that we could be exposed to costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if we were successful in enforcing our patents against an infringer or successful in defending against proceedings to invalidate our patents or proceedings alleging breach by us of a third party s patents 
additionally  if we were unsuccessful in proceedings challenging our patents  third parties licensed by us under those patents might seek to terminate such licenses and cease paying royalties 
if we were unsuccessful in defending against a claim that we had infringed a third party s patent  even unknowingly  we could be subject to a permanent injunction against engaging in the infringing business as well as an award of damages measured by the profits obtained from past infringement 
because of our relative lack of financial and management resources  we could be less able than our competitors to bear such risks 
employees as of december   we had twelve full time employees  comprised of three persons at our drug development center at kettering in the united kingdom and nine persons at our napa  california headquarters 

table of contents risk factors as stated in the preamble to this annual report on form k  this document contains numerous forward looking statements which we believe to be a fair reflection of our risks and opportunities 
however  such statements by their nature are future related and involve substantial uncertainties 
in addition to those factors referred to elsewhere in part i of this annual report  particularly the sections in item entitled competition  government regulation and intellectual property  and in part ii of this annual report  particularly in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have identified the following factors that may affect whether future events may differ materially from the expectations described in such forward looking statements 
limited product offering and relatively fixed revenue stream 
substantially all of our current revenue base is derived from license fees on our patented kinetin ingredient  which are being amortized into income over the terms of the licenses  and royalties earned on licensees sale of such licensed products which are generally paid quarterly 
in addition  part of current revenues reflect the retained portion of royalties received from signet on sales of cell lines for production of monoclonal antibodies that are not remitted to the foundation under the terms of our license agreement with it 
if our patents on kinetin were successfully challenged and our kinetin licensees sought to terminate their licenses  our revenue stream would be substantially curtailed  and if the foundation s patents were successfully challenged  the foundation failed to renew its license with us beginning in  or if the state of new york ceased supporting the foundation  our sublicense with signet would yield substantially reduced revenues 
additionally  our present revenue stream is tied to our licensees sales of licensed product and accordingly is relatively fixed unless new territories are launched or expansion in existing territories occurs 
should we be faced with significant cash requirements in connection with gaining regulatory approvals of our biopharmaceutical products currently in development or in connection with protecting our patents or defending against patent infringement litigation  our capital resources might be inadequate to fund our capital needs  as described below 
concentrated revenue base 
in  three of our customers accounted for  and of our revenue and approximately  and  respectively of our net trade receivables at december  however  while we have no security for payment of such trade receivables  we believe that all of such customers are credit worthy and committed to fully performing their license obligations 
nevertheless  should any of such customers cease paying receivables when due or cease performing under their respective licenses  our results would be adversely affected 
subsequent to december   approximately of the above mentioned accounts receivable were collected in full 
limited capital resources 
as described under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  all of our borrowings are from a single source pursuant to agreements under which our funding source has substantial control over our ability to incur additional debt or dispose of assets  substantially all of which are pledged as security for our borrowings 
in the event that we are unable to fund through our operating cash flow or raise additional cash through equity offerings  continued product development and governmental marketing approvals of our pharmaceutical products or such unbudgeted expenses as the defense of our position in patent litigation  we would currently be dependent upon this source for additional funding  and if we were unable to arrange for funding upon acceptable terms  our business could be materially adversely affected 
new product pipeline 
we have a pipeline of new products and new indications for existing products in development  and should we be successful in developing and obtaining marketing approvals for these products  to the extent required  we expect to be successful in our business plan to achieve high margin  replicable revenues and increasing profits 
however  because of regulatory and competitive uncertainties  no assurance can be given that these products can be successfully developed and marketed 
competitive ed therapies 
oral medications currently represent approximately of the worldwide market for ed treatment because of their ease of use and non invasive path of administration 
pfizer s viagra 
table of contents represents virtually all of this oral medication market 
we believe that there will nevertheless be a market for our invicorp ed injectable therapy because of its greater efficacy  favorable side effect and contraindication profiles  and relatively aesthetic delivery systems 
however  there can be no assurance that new competitive injectable ed medications will not be developed to fulfill many if not all of ed patients needs that are currently unmet  or that our injection therapy will in fact gain acceptance 
competitive impacts on our market for skincare ingredients 
we face intense competition for the discovery and development of ingredients to address signs of photoaging and other skincare conditions from large  global companies with far greater research  development and marketing resources than ours  and there can be no assurance that our existing products or new products developed for our skincare segment will maintain market acceptance in competition with existing and new offerings of our competitors 
management infrastructure 
we currently employ people  and have a very small  though we believe highly qualified and motivated  management cadre 
should we lose significant management resources and be unable to attract high caliber replacements to continue implementing our business plan  we could be materially adversely affected 
we are actively seeking to build management  operational and marketing infrastructure  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to staff our requirements in a manner adequate to support our planned growth 
item properties we lease approximately  square feet in napa  california for our headquarters 
the headquarters facility includes approximately  square feet of manufacturing space and  square feet of research  marketing and administrative space 
the lease for the napa facility expires in december we also lease an approximately  square foot building in kettering  united kingdom  under a year lease with a break option after one year 
the uk break option has been exercised as of march  and we are in the process of moving into square feet of office space in st neots  united kingdom  under a year lease with a month rolling break option 
item legal proceedings on june  we filed a lawsuit against mad dogs englishmen inc and mad dog enterprises d b a mad dogs englishmen together mad dogs in the supreme court of new york 
on december  we entered into a written agreement with mad dogs under which mad dogs agreed to promote our cosmetics business and to hire a consultant familiar with the cosmetics industry in connection therewith 
we are seeking damages of approximately million for a breach of that agreement 
mad dogs served us with an answer to our complaint in august and subsequently counterclaimed alleging that ccsi is liable to mad dogs for at least  in unpaid fees and other unspecified damages 
there have been no substantive developments in the lawsuit since the filing of the answer to our complaint

the board of directors is  however  empowered to declare interim dividends 
however  under the english companies act of  a limited company may not declare or pay cash dividends while it has an accumulated deficit 
we had an accumulated deficit of  at december  accordingly  the board of directors will not be in a position to consider the question of dividends until the accumulated deficit has been absorbed by profits or by the application against the deficit with the approval of shareholders and the united kingdom companies court  which forms part of the chancery division of the high court  of an equivalent figure forming part of the share premium on our balance sheet

on june   we entered into a license and royalty agreement with revlon for kinetin in the mass market  excluding certain asian countries 
in exchange for these rights we received a non refundable license fee of  in connection with this licensing arrangement we issued to revlon warrants to purchase one million of our ordinary shares at a price of per share 
the fair value of the warrants which amounted to  was deducted from the license fee received and the balance of the fee was recorded as deferred income which will be recognized over the life of the kinetin patent 
the overall revenue increase of for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was represented by an increase in skincare revenues of and a decrease in pharmaceutical sales  comprising named patient sales and monoclonal antibodies revenues of 
the increase in overall skincare revenues was due mainly to increased royalty income from licensees of million  particularly with revlon and the body shop

the increase in skincare revenues was due mainly to increased kinetin based product sales to our licensees for whom we supply products  and royalty income from licensees  particularly revlon and icn 
revlon s almay kinetin skincare launch was successful in the us and select overseas markets  and is supported by major regional and national television and print advertising and promotional campaigns pursuant to revlon s contractual obligations to senetek 
substantially all of the company s current revenue base is derived from license fees and royalties on its patented kinetin cosmetic ingredient  and revenues on licensees sale of such licensed products 
in addition  part of current revenues reflect the retained portion of royalties received from signet on sales of cell lines for production of monoclonal antibodies that are not remitted to the foundation under the terms of the company s license agreement with it 
if the company s patents on kinetin were successfully challenged and the company s kinetin licensees sought to terminate their licenses  the company s revenue stream would be substantially curtailed  and if the foundation s patents were successfully challenged or the foundation failed to renew its license with the company in for the cell lines covered by the original license  the company s sublicense with signet would yield substantially reduced revenues 
additionally  the company s present revenue stream is tied to its licensees sales of licensed product and accordingly is relatively fixed by supply of product to meet consumer demand 
should the company be faced with significant cash requirements in connection with gaining regulatory approvals of its biopharmaceutical products currently in development or in connection with protecting its patents or defending against patent infringement litigation  the company s capital resources might be inadequate to fund its capital needs  as described below 
cost of sales cost of sales for the year ended december   which includes contract manufacturing  material costs and royalty expense was  down from the year ended december   despite a increase in revenues 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the cost of sales expressed as a percentage of net revenues decrease is due mainly to the recognition of increased royalties income from revlon  icn  the body shop  omp and med beauty for which there are no associated costs 
in the pharmaceutical segment  cost of sales for the year ended december  was  a decrease of from  for the year ended december  this reduction was due to a reduction in pharmaceutical sales 
for the year ended december   the cost of sales was  a reduction of from  for the year ended december  this reduction was due mainly to out licensing arrangements that replaced product sales with royalty income

during the year  there was an increase in product sales to icn compared with the year  resulting in an increase in skincare cost of sales of over the  cost of sales for the year ended december  research and development pharmaceutical division research and development expenses in the year ended december  were  compared with  and  in and  respectively 
the increase of  in compared to was due to higher levels of spending  mainly in the areas of expert consulting and process validation for the development of invicorp as we proceed with the mrp and finalize arrangements for the manufacture and supply of product 
increased efforts related to the company s efforts to gain approval and complete its drug delivery devices  reliaject and adriaject  also resulted in increased development expenditures 
we also engaged the services of a senior scientific consultant during the third quarter of the decrease of  in compared with was primarily due to the reduction in expenditures resulting from improved efficiencies in our research and development programs and decreased spending for the development of invicorp and adrenaject 
we expect future research and development spending to increase as we bring these products to market  however  a proportion of our research and development expenses are absorbed by our commercial partners 
we expect research and development spending for our sexual dysfunction products to potentially increase significantly as we progress with the mrp in europe and prepare for discussions with the fda  regarding the number and scope of invicorp clinical trials in the us in this connection  we are working with quintiles  a leading provider of information  technology and services to the pharmaceuticals industry  to support our efforts in bringing invicorp to market in europe and in the us as efficiently as possible 
we are currently working with the danish medicines agency on the mrp process and with the medicines control agency in the united kingdom on the invicorp product and have commenced work for the reactivation of our investigational new drug approval with the fda in the us 
after completion of their assessment work on the updated clinical and pharmaceutical dossiers  assuming satisfactory results  the danish medicines agency is expected to progress the mrp filings and we are hopeful of receiving european union approvals during the first quarter of depending on the cost and timing of the approval process with the danish medicines agency  we could potentially spend up to  in on this research and development  including costs related to the granting of the european union marketing approvals for our invicorp product 
we are attempting to develop strategic relationships with companies that can help us share in the cost of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals and market the product 
we are also in the process of filing manufacturing site variation applications for invicorp with the danish medicines agency and new zealand s medsafe  which when accepted will enable us to supply product to patients in these countries  where we already have existing marketing approvals 
we are expecting to launch invicorp in new zealand in the third quarter of  followed by an invicorp launch in denmark in the fourth quarter of we are also continuing our development of our drug delivery devices  reliaject and adrenaject  and anticipate moving forward with product completion and necessary regulatory approvals 
overall we anticipate our research and development expenditures in to be consistent with our level 

table of contents skincare division research and development expenses in the year ended december  were  compared with  and  in and  respectively 
the  increased expenditures in compared to was primarily due to the increased funding provided to our research partners for the development and testing of potential new skincare products 
the decrease of  in compared with is mainly due to reduced expenditures resulting from the shifting of responsibility for regulatory filings  product testing and formulation development to our commercial partners 
overall we do not anticipate any significant changes during related to research and development efforts of our skincare products 
as we have done over the past few years  utilization of strategic commercial partners has helped limit these expenditures general and administrative the allocation of general and administrative expense between segments for the years ended december  and has been re calculated to be consistent with the method of allocation for the corresponding year ended december  there is no change to the previously reported total for general and administrative expense for the years ended december  and the general and administrative expenses are allocated equally to each business segment 
pharmaceutical division general and administrative expenses totaled  for  compared with  for and  for  respectively 
the decrease of  in compared to  and the decrease of  in compared to was mainly due to more efficient spending programs and the elimination of non essential administration activities

in connection with the april re financing and settlement agreement  the company issued series a  b and c warrants to purchase an aggregate of million ordinary shares at per share  million ordinary shares at per share and million ordinary shares at per share  respectively 
the series b and series c warrants expire years from the date of issuance 
june refinancing on june   the company and its lenders amended their borrowing arrangement  whereby  the maturity of these notes was extended until april a transaction fee amounting to of the principal amount outstanding on these notes paid to scorpion holdings in ordinary shares worth  and legal costs of  were incurred to effect this transaction 
in connection with this amendment  the terms of the warrants were also amended 
the expiration date of the series a warrants was extended to ten years from the date of issuance and the exercise price per share was adjusted to 
the exercise price per share of the series b and series c warrants have been adjusted to and respectively 
as the outstanding borrowings under the securities purchase agreement were refinanced by modification of the notes with substantially different terms  the company was required to recognize the excess of the sum of the fair value of the modified notes and the fair value assigned to the warrant modification as compared to the carrying value of the previous notes net of unamortized issuance costs  as a loss on the extinguishment of debt 
as the difference was insignificant  no loss on extinguishment was recorded in the amortization of the discount on the notes amounted to  for the year ended december   compared to  and  for the years ended december  and respectively

fin clarifies the application of opinion no 
for a the definition of employee for purposes of applying opinion no 
 b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  c the accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
in accordance with fin  which became effective july  we have changed our accounting principles for the recognition of stock compensation expense for non compensatory stock option awards to non executive directors all of whom retire by rotation and can stand for re election at our shareholder annual general meeting 
we have included our non executive directors within the scope of apb and have reported the cumulative effect of changing to this new accounting principle in net income of the period of the change 
this change in accounting principle has decreased the net loss in by  
table of contents taxation refer to note to the financial statements for discussion of our net operating loss carry forwards 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased by  during to  this increase is due to increased revenues and an increase in the percentage of revenues represented by high margin royalty receipts 
in addition we have increased our current ratio to at december   a substantial improvement from as of december  we expect our operating cash flow and current available cash to fund our research and development budget for  which is estimated at million 
however  we may also continue to rely on additional sources of private financing through equity financing  short term loans or proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants 
in april  we issued  in aggregate principal amount of secured promissory notes 
the notes currently bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually  and are due and payable in full in april on june  under an amendment to the securities purchase agreement the maturity of these notes was extended to april a transaction fee amounting to of the principal amount outstanding was paid to scorpion holdings in ordinary shares with respect to this transaction 
the notes require semi annual payment of interest only until maturity and are secured by our assets 
interest may be paid in cash or in ordinary shares of senetek 
during  the company will actively pursue refinancing these promissory notes 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure new financing prior to the note s maturity in april the repayment of the notes is secured by all of the assets of senetek plc and its subsidiaries 
in exchange for the issuance of the notes  we received  in cash less expenses and refinancing of  of our previously outstanding debt 
we also issued series a  series b and series c warrants to purchase ordinary shares in connection with the issuance of the notes 
although we have received no commitment for the advance of any further funds  other lenders who advance up to an additional  may share in the collateral securing the notes described above on the same basis with the existing note holders 
because substantially all of the company s borrowings are from a single source which has substantial control over the company s ability to incur additional secured debt or dispose of assets  substantially all of which are pledged as security for the company s borrowings  in the event that the company is unable to fund through its operating cash flow or proceeds from the sale of equity securities  continued product development and governmental marketing approvals of its pharmaceutical products or such unbudgeted expenses as the defense of its position in patent litigation  it would currently be dependent upon this source for additional funding  and if it were unable to arrange for funding upon acceptable terms  the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
on june  we executed an agreement with wallington investments limited for a convertible secured line of credit up to million 
the line of credit expired on june  and was never used 
our other most significant expenditure commitments are our research agreements  consulting agreements  employment agreements and property leases 
although we expect that our operations will generate sufficient cash to meet our short term financial requirements  there can be no assurance that our revenue sources will continue or that our expenses will be as planned 

table of contents as of december  we had approximately million of fixed assets in progress for the manufacture of reliaject components and the subsequent filling of the system 
these assets were initially purchased in and we expect them to be commercially deployed within the next months 
we anticipate that additional spending of approximately  will be required to bring these assets into commercial use 
invicorp is currently approved in three countries in reliaject and ampoule format and we have solved all outstanding manufacturing issues 
we are presently negotiating with a potential marketing partner a licensing arrangement for invicorp in europe 
we are also developing an alternative plan for marketing and distributing invicorp on our own 
we will ultimately be making a decision on the expected financial outcomes of the two scenarios 
although these discussions may lead to a license agreement of a substantial nature in due course  we cannot assure that we will be successful in securing such an agreement  which could result in a write down of all or part of the carrying value of this asset 
such a write down  although it would not effect the company s short term cash position  would have a material adverse impact on future net income 
we believe that future cash flows will exceed the carrying value of the asset 
additionally  certain holders of a substantial number of warrants may exercise their right to convert their warrants into shares upon payment to us of the exercise price as the conversion dates approach 
government policy it is our opinion that there are no aspects of government policy which  as far as can be foreseen  are likely to have a material effect on the conduct of our business  except as generally described in part i  item  of this form k under the heading government regulation 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had any material effect on the results of our operations to date 
critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission requested that all registrants list their three to five most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analyses of financial condition and results of operations 
the securities and exchange commission indicated a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we believe that the following accounting policies fit the definition of critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of the company s skincare products and named patient sales of invicorp is recognized at the time of shipment  which is when legal title and risk of loss is transferred to the company s customers  and is recorded at the net invoiced value of goods supplied to customers after deduction of sales and value added tax where applicable 
royalties received from our licensee on their sale of monoclonal antibodies are recognized in accordance with the contract 
under the contract  royalties received on level sales which represents senetek s original customer base  are at a higher rate than royalties received on level sales 
royalty income from level and level sales is recognized by senetek on the basis of the level and level sales reports received from our licensee 
fees received from the licensing of manufacturing and distribution rights for our skincare products are deferred and recognized as revenue as earned  which is generally on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
royalties from the company s skincare licensees are recognized based on estimates that approximate the point products have been sold by the licensees 
the company receives sales reports from the licensee and based upon this information  plus subsequent cash receipts  records royalty revenue 
royalty revenue is generally paid by the licensee within days of quarter end 
estimates are adjusted to reflect actual results within one quarter of product shipment 
historically  license revenue has not differed significantly from management s estimates 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets such as property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other long lived assets and property and equipment may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
on january   statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective  and as a result  we ceased amortizing this goodwill 
we recorded approximately  of goodwill amortization during and would have recorded  in goodwill amortization during in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
based upon the analysis performed  no goodwill impairment is currently required 
however  there can be no assurance that a future impairment charge might not be required 
as of december  we had approximately million of fixed assets in progress for the manufacture of reliaject components and the subsequent filling and assembly of the reliaject system 
these assets were initially purchased in and we expect them to be commercially deployed within the next months 
we anticipate that an additional spending of approximately  will be required to bring these assets into commercial use 
invicorp is currently approved in three countries and on an ongoing basis we are reviewing potential partners for marketing and distribution arrangements for invicorp in europe 
since we cannot assure that we will be successful in securing an arrangement that will meet our return on investment roi criteria  we are also developing an alternative plan for marketing and distributing invicorp on our own 
running in parallel to our regulatory and pre marketing efforts in europe  we have finalized consolidating our manufacturing equipment for the production of reliaject in napa  california 
our plans are to manufacture the reliaject components ourselves or lease or sell the equipment to an experienced device manufacturer while securing the exclusive rights for reliaject for our core markets of erectile dysfunction and anaphylaxis 
during the third quarter of  we commissioned an independent study to determine the fair value of the exclusive manufacturing rights of the reliaject autoinjector system with an established firm of valuation advisors 
they have formed the opinion that the fair value of these rights is in the range of to million 
the market assumptions in the valuation model were based on invicorp gaining approval under the european mutual recognition process in the third quarter of and making estimates of invicorp in reliaject sales in accordance with market research data 
obtaining regulatory approvals throughout the european union represents a key prerequisite to securing collaborative partners or customers 
should we not be successful in gaining european union approvals  operating the manufacturing equipment for production of reliaject components ourselves or in leasing the equipment to a third party or its outright sale  we could be required by accounting rules to write down all or part of the carrying value of this asset in progress 
such a write down could have a material adverse impact on future net income 
we believe that future cash flows will exceed the carrying value of the asset 
income taxes as a result of our historical losses  we have significant deferred tax assets that could be utilized if we generate future taxable income and are required to pay income taxes 
however  pursuant to the change in ownership provisions of the tax reform act of  utilization of our net operating loss carryover may be 
table of contents limited if a cumulative change of ownership of more than occurs within any three year period 
we have not determined if such a change in ownership has occurred or the amount of the loss carryover limitation  if any 
we believe that our current business model will ultimately lead to sustained profitability and that the deferred tax asset will have value  but due to our lack of profitable historical operating history  potential limitations on usage of operating losses and general uncertainty  we provided for a valuation allowance against our entire deferred tax asset 
should our operating results and analysis of change in ownership provisions indicate that our profitability is more likely than not to lead to the utilization of all or a portion of the deferred tax asset  we will reverse all or a portion of our valuation allowance 
subsequent changes to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nol is utilized  assuming that a change in ownership does not limit those losses 
contractual obligations the company has contractual obligations to make future payments under its long term note and non cancelable lease agreements 
the following table sets forth these contractual obligations thereafter total in thousands notes payable fixed rate other long term minimum rental commitments impact of recently issued accounting standards see note n to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  variability in interest rate spread relationships ie  prime to libor spreads and exchange rate variability 
we believe that fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates in the near term would not materially affect our consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows as we have limited risks related to interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
foreign currencies we have operations in the united kingdom  where the functional currency is the pound sterling 
we follow currency translation principles established by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
all assets and liabilities in the balance sheets of the uk operation are translated at period end exchange rates 
all income and expenditure items in the profit and loss account of the uk operation are translated at average monthly exchange rates 
translation gains and losses arising from the translation of the financial statements of the uk operation are not included in determining net income but are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net income in the period in which they occur 
we do not use any methods to hedge the effect of changes in the pound sterling exchange rate
