overview cv therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of new small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases 
since our inception in december  substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to research and development 
to date  we have not generated any product revenues and do not expect to generate any product revenues until we receive marketing approval and launch of one of our products  if at all 
until that time  we expect our sources of revenues  if any  to consist of payments under corporate partnerships and interest income until one of our products receives marketing approval  if at all 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the process of developing and commercializing our products requires significant research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  manufacturing arrangements as well as marketing approvals 
these activities  together with our sales and marketing expenses and our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we will not receive product revenues unless and until we or our collaborative partners complete clinical trials  obtain marketing approval  and successfully commercialize one or more of our products 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition  use of hazardous materials and retention of key employees 
in order for a product to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us and  in some cases  our collaborators  to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies presently involve our more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements valuation of marketable securities we invest our excess cash balances primarily in short term and long term marketable debt securities for use in current operations 
accordingly  we have classified all investments as short term  even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
estimated fair value is based upon quoted market prices for these or similar instruments 

table of contents clinical trial accruals our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful accrual of patients  the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
revenue recognition revenue under our collaborative research arrangements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract 
amounts received under such arrangements consist of up front license and periodic milestone payments 
up front or milestone payments which are still subject to future performance requirements are recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized over the performance period 
the performance period is estimated at the inception of the arrangement and is periodically reevaluated 
the reevaluation of the performance period may shorten or lengthen the period during which the deferred revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the appropriate period based on research progress attained and events such as changes in the regulatory and competitive environment 
payments received related to substantive  at risk milestones are recognized upon achievement of the scientific or regulatory event specified in the underlying agreement 
payments received for research activities are recognized as the related research effort is performed 
results of operations years ended december  and collaborative research revenues 
collaborative research revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a million milestone payment recognized in march from biogen  inc  earned in conjunction with their initiation of a phase i oral development program for adentri  and a million milestone payment recognized in september from fujisawa healthcare inc  related to our initiation of a phase ii clinical trial for cvt  partially offset by increased reimbursement during of certain development costs related to our collaboration with fujisawa 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to expenses for the ranexa program related to new drug application nda preparation and submission  and manufacturing related agreements along with hiring additional employees to support our research and development programs and expenses associated with our tecadenoson cvt and cvt programs 
we expect research and development expenses may increase in the future as we further expand product development efforts 
management categorizes research and development expenditures into amounts related to preclinical research and amounts related to three clinical development programs  listed in rank order of estimated expenditures for all periods discussed below ranexa  tecadenoson cvt and cvt during the year ended december   we incurred approximately of our research and development expenditures  or approximately million  in connection with clinical development programs  and the remaining  or million  in connection with preclinical research programs 
by comparison  during the year ended december   we incurred approximately of our research and development expenditures  or 
table of contents million  in connection with clinical development programs and the remaining of our research and development expenditures  or million  in connection with preclinical research programs 
the increased allocation of resources to development projects compared to preclinical research reflects the increased costs of advancing our clinical programs into late stage clinical development 
according to industry statistics  it generally takes to years to research  develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the united states 
drug development in the us is a process that includes multiple steps defined by the fda under applicable statutes  regulations and guidance documents 
after the pre clinical research process of identifying  selecting and testing in animals a potential pharmaceutical compound  the clinical development process begins with the filing of an investigational drug application ind 
if successful  an ind allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase i  ii  and iii 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase iii trials  which tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after the completion of a successful preclinical and clinical development program  a new drug application nda must be filed with the fda  which includes among other things very large amounts of preclinical and clinical data and results and manufacturing related information necessary to support requested approval of the product 
the nda must be reviewed by the fda  and the review and approval process is often uncertain  time consuming and costly 
in light of the steps and complexities involved  the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
actual product timelines and costs are subject to enormous variability and are very difficult to predict  as our clinical development programs are updated and changed to reflect the most recent clinical and pre clinical data and other relevant information 
in addition  various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety reporting  labeling  storage  recordkeeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these regulatory reviews and approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to an nda submission  the fda may grant marketing approval  may request additional information  may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval  and the fda may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review 
we can not assure you that any approval required by the fda will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
for additional discussion of the regulatory processes for pharmaceuticals and of risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see government regulations  above  and the risk factors entitled our product candidates will take at least several years to develop  and we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop  market and manufacture these products  if we are unable to satisfy the regulatory requirements for our clinical trials  we will not be able to commercialize our drug candidates  if we are unable to satisfy governmental regulations relating to the development of our drug candidates  we may be unable to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals to commercialize our products  and we have no manufacturing experience and will depend on third parties to manufacture our products 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to pre commercialization activities for the ranexa program  including expenses for marketing planning and market communications 
we have not incurred any sales related expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the future as we further expand our pre commercialization activities 
sales and marketing expenses have previously been included in research and development expenses and all prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to fees paid in connection with outside consulting services and additional personnel and facility expenses to support our increased research  development and pre commercialization efforts 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future in line with our research  development and pre commercialization activities 

table of contents interest income 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates 
the average investment balances were lower primarily as the result of cash used to fund operations 
we expect that interest income will fluctuate with average investment balances and market interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  which was consistent with interest expense of million for the year ended december  our subordinated convertible notes account for million of the interest expense in each of these years 
we expect that interest and other expense will fluctuate with average loan balances 
taxes 
we have not generated taxable income to date 
as of december   the net operating losses potentially available to offset future taxable income for federal and california income tax purposes were approximately million and million  respectively 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards will likely be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the federal carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
the california carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
as a result of annual limitations  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before becoming available to reduce our federal and california income tax liabilities 
years ended december  and collaborative research revenues 
collaborative research revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to greater amortization of up front payments and reimbursement of certain development costs related to our collaboration with fujisawa which began in july milestones recognized for the year ended december   included million from fujisawa which was earned in conjunction with our initiation of a phase ii clinical trial for cvt  and million from biogen which was earned in conjunction with their initiation of a phase i oral development program for adentri 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to greater external costs associated with our continued development of ranexa and our other clinical programs in addition to hiring additional employees to provide support for an increased level of activity in our research  development and clinical programs 
management categorizes research and development expenditures into amounts related to preclinical research and amounts related to three clinical development programs  listed in rank order of estimated expenditures for all periods discussed below ranexa  tecadenoson cvt and cvt during the year ended december   we incurred approximately of our research and development expenditures  or approximately million  in connection with clinical development programs  and the remaining  or million  in connection with preclinical research programs 
by comparison  during the year ended december   we incurred approximately of our research and development expenditures  or million  in connection with clinical development programs and the remaining of our research and development expenditures  or million  in connection with preclinical research programs 
the increased allocation of resources to development projects compared to pre clinical research reflects the increased costs of advancing all three clinical programs into later state clinical development 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to greater market research and preliminary pre commercialization expenses for the ranexa program 
we have not incurred any sales related expenses 
sales and marketing expenses have previously been included in research and 
table of contents development expenses and all prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to fees paid in connection with outside consulting services and additional personnel and facility expenses to support our increased research and development efforts 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to higher average investment balances as the result of the sale of convertible subordinated notes in march and the proceeds received from our follow on public offerings in june and december  offset by lower average interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to interest expense related to the convertible subordinated notes issued in march which equaled million in and million in recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with the exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas require companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with operating lease agreements 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  our adoption of the recommendation and measurement provisions of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards referred to as sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require 
table of contents more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we do not expect that the adoption of fin will have a material effect on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private placements and public offerings of debt and equity securities  equipment and leasehold improvement financing  other debt financing and payments received under corporate collaborations 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million as of december  we currently estimate that our existing resources and projected interest income will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next months 
in march  we entered into a purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold to certain purchasers million in aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
the offering of the notes was made to qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act of  as amended 
interest on the notes will accrue at a rate of per year  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  with interest payments semi annually on march th and september th of each year 
the notes will mature on march   and are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  as more fully described in note to our financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  we may  at our option  redeem the notes at any time after march  in march  we repaid the initial million installment under a general purpose loan facility with biogen  inc  bringing the outstanding balance to million 
in august  we drew down an additional million under this biogen loan facility  bringing the outstanding balance to million 
in october  we exercised our right to convert million in debt from the biogen loan facility into  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  in full repayment of the entire principal amount under this loan facility 
in december  we repaid all accrued and unpaid interest on the loan facility  in full repayment of the loan facility 
in july  we entered into a collaboration with fujisawa to develop and market second generation pharmacologic cardiac stress agents 
in connection with the signing of this agreement  we received million from fujisawa consisting of an up front payment and the purchase of our common stock 
in september  we received a million milestone payment under this collaboration for initiating a phase ii clinical trial of cvt in august  we entered into a financing arrangement with acqua wellington to purchase our common stock 
under the purchase agreement  as presently amended  we may sell a total of million of our 
table of contents common stock to acqua wellington through december the purchase agreement provides that from time to time  in our sole discretion  we may present acqua wellington with draw down notices constituting offers to sell our common stock for specified total proceeds over a specified pricing period 
once presented with a draw down notice  acqua wellington is required to purchase a pro rata portion of shares of our common stock as allocated on each trading day during the pricing period on which the daily volume weighted average price for our common stock exceeds a threshold price that we determine and state in the draw down notice 
the threshold price we set may not be below per share without acqua wellington s consent 
the per share price then equals the daily volume weighted average price on each date during the pricing period  less a to discount to be determined based on our market capitalization at the start of the pricing period  unless we agree with acqua wellington to a different discount 
however  if the daily volume weighted average price falls below the threshold price on any day in the pricing period  acqua wellington is not required to purchase the pro rata portion of shares allocated to that day  but can elect to buy that pro rata portion of shares at the threshold price less the applicable discount 
further  if during a pricing period we enter into an agreement with a third party to issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock excluding stock or options granted pursuant to our stock option  stock purchase or shareholder rights plans  common stock or warrants issued in connection with licensing agreements and or collaborative agreements and warrants issued in connection with equipment financings at a net discount to the then current market price  if we issue common stock with warrants other than provided in the prior parenthetical  or if we implement a mechanism for the reset of the purchase price of our common stock below the then current market price  then acqua wellington can elect to purchase the shares so requested by us in the draw down notice at the price established pursuant to the prior paragraph  to purchase such shares at the third party s price  net of discount or fees  or to not purchase our common stock during that pricing period 
the purchase agreement also provides that from time to time  in our sole discretion  we may grant acqua wellington a right to exercise one or more call options to purchase additional shares of our common stock during a pricing period  in an amount and for a threshold price that we determine and state in the draw down notice 
however  the total call amount for any given draw down cannot exceed a specified maximum amount  and the amount of proceeds we may receive by exercise of a call option for any given trading day is also limited 
if acqua wellington exercises the call option  we will issue and sell the shares of our common stock subject to the call option at a price equal to the greater of the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on the day acqua wellington exercises its call option  or the threshold price for the call option that we have determined  less a to discount based on our market capitalization  unless we agree with acqua wellington to a different discount 
the combined total value of shares that we may sell to acqua wellington through draw downs and call option exercises under the arrangement may not exceed million 
in addition  applicable rules limit the number of shares of common stock that we may issue under our purchase agreement with acqua wellington to approximately  shares 
as of december   we issued  shares of common stock in exchange for aggregate net proceeds of million under this arrangement  including million during the year ended december  as of march   we have issued  shares of common stock in exchange for aggregate net proceeds of million under this arrangement 
in june  we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of per share pursuant to a prospectus supplement under a shelf registration statement  resulting in net proceeds of million  after deducting the underwriting expenses and commissions and other offering expenses 
in december  we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of per share pursuant to a prospectus supplement under a shelf registration statement  resulting in net proceeds of million  after deducting the underwriting expenses and commissions and other offering expenses 
we are using and intend to continue to use the net proceeds from these sales for general corporate purposes  which may include funding research  development and product manufacturing  development 
table of contents of clinical trials  preparation and submission of new drug applications  product commercialization  increasing our working capital  reducing indebtedness  acquisitions of or investments in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to our own  and capital expenditures 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  totaled million compared to million at december  the decrease was due to utilizing million to fund operations and million for capital expenditures  partially offset by million raised from the issuance of our common stock  including million of common stock issued pursuant to our arrangement with acqua wellington 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase for each year was primarily due to increased research  development and commercialization efforts 
as of december   we have invested million in property and equipment with the rate of investment having increased in line with increased research and development efforts and as we expand our facilities 
we expect to continue to make investments in property and equipment to support our growth 
under our license agreement with syntex usa relating to ranexa  we paid an initial license fee  and are obligated to make certain milestone payments to syntex  upon receipt of the first and second product approvals for ranexa in any of certain major market countries consisting of france  germany  italy  the united states and the united kingdom 
unless the agreement is terminated  in connection with the first such product approval  we will pay syntex  on or before march   million plus interest accrued thereon from may  until the date of payment 
unless the agreement is terminated  if the second product approval in one of the major market countries occurs before may   we will pay syntex  on or before march   million plus interest accrued thereon from the date of approval until the date of payment  and if the second such product approval occurs after may   but before march   we will pay syntex  on or before march   million plus interest accrued thereon from may   until the date of payment

we may require substantial additional funding in order to complete our research and development activities and commercialize any potential products 
we currently estimate that our existing resources and projected interest income will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next months 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional funding prior to then or that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in our research  development and commercialization programs  the size and complexity of these programs  the timing  scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  our ability to establish and maintain corporate partnerships  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing preclinical and clinical material and other factors not within our control 
we cannot guarantee that the additional financing to meet our capital requirements will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research  development or commercialization programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose  or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we issue equity securities to raise additional funds  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result
