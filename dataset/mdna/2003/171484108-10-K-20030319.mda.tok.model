environmental matters the septic system at our ellis park facility must be replaced with a hook up to city sewers 
the cost of the hook up is estimated by the city of henderson  kentucky to be million 
ellis park applied for partial funding from the state of kentucky during the project is expected to be completed during in  we acquired certain assets of louisville downs incorporated for million including the site of the louisville otb 
in conjunction with this purchase  we withheld million from the amount due to the sellers to offset certain costs related to the remediation of environmental contamination associated with underground storage tanks at the site 
all of the million hold back had been utilized as of december  and additional costs of remediation have not yet been conclusively determined 
the sellers had previously received a reimbursement of million from the commonwealth of kentucky for remediation costs  and that amount is now being held in an escrow account to pay further costs of remediation 
approximately million  including interest on the escrow principal  remains in the account 
the seller has submitted a corrective action plan to the state and has reported to the state that all wells  with the exception of one  are below action 
well testing continues and the kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet has not taken final action on this matter 
in addition to the hold back  we have obtained an indemnity to cover the full cost of remediation from the prior owner of the property 
we do not believe the cost of further investigation and remediation will exceed the amount of funds in the escrow 
it is not anticipated that we will have any material liability as a result of compliance with environmental laws with respect to any of our properties 
compliance with environmental laws has not materially affected the ability to develop and operate our properties and we are not otherwise subject to any material compliance costs in connection with federal or state environmental laws

you should read this discussion together with the financial statements and other financial information included in the report 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
general information about our business we conduct pari mutuel wagering on live thoroughbred  quarter horse and standardbred horse racing and simulcast signals of races 
additionally  we offer racing services through our other interests 
we operate the churchill downs racetrack in louisville  kentucky  which has conducted thoroughbred racing since and is internationally known as the home of the kentucky derby  and ellis park race course  inc  a thoroughbred racing operation in henderson  kentucky collectively referred to as kentucky operations 
we also own and operate hollywood park  a thoroughbred racing operation in inglewood  california  arlington park  a thoroughbred racing operation in arlington heights  illinois  and calder racecourse  a thoroughbred racing operation in miami  florida 
additionally  we are the majority owner and operator of hoosier park in anderson  indiana  which conducts thoroughbred  quarter horse and standardbred horse racing 
we conduct simulcast wagering on horse racing at ten simulcast wagering facilities in kentucky  indiana and illinois  as well as at our six racetracks 
the churchill downs simulcast network cdsn segment was developed in to focus on the distribution of the company s simulcast signal 
cdsn oversees our interstate and international simulcast and wagering opportunities  as well as the marketing  sales  operations and data support efforts related to the company owned racing content 
our revenues and earnings are significantly influenced by our racing calendar 
therefore  revenues and operating results for any interim quarter are not generally indicative of the revenues and operating results for the year 
we historically have very few live racing days during the first quarter  with a majority of our live racing occurring in the second  third and fourth quarters  including the running of the kentucky derby and kentucky oaks in the second quarter 
information regarding racing dates at our facilities for and is included in item e  licenses and live racing dates of this form k 
our pari mutuel revenues include commissions on pari mutuel wagering at our racetracks and off track betting facilities net of state pari mutuel taxes  plus simulcast host fees  and source market fees generated from contracts with our in home wagering providers 
in addition to the commissions earned on pari mutuel wagering we also earn pari mutuel related streams of revenues from sources that are not related to the handle wagered at our facilities 
these other revenues are primarily derived from statutory racing regulations in some of the states where our facilities are located and can fluctuate year to year 
additional non wagering revenues are primarily generated from indiana riverboat admisssions subsidy  admissions  concessions  sponsorships  licensing rights and broadcast fees  lease income and other sources 
greater than of our annual revenues are generated by pari mutuel wagering on both live and simulcast racing content 
live racing handle includes patron wagers on live races at our live tracks and also wagers made on imported simulcast signals during live races 
import simulcasting handle includes wagers on imported signals at our racetracks when the respective tracks are not conducting live races and at our otbs throughout the year 
export handle includes all patron wagers made on our live racing signals sent to other tracks or otbs 
the pari mutuel operator retains as revenue a pre determined percentage of the total amount wagered  and the balance is distributed to the winning patrons 
the percentages retained on live racing at our various locations range from to 
in general  the commissions earned from import and export simulcasting are contractually determined and range from to 
all commissions earned from pari mutuel wagering are shared with horsemen based on local contracts and average approximately 
to compensate for the adverse impact of riverboat competition  the horse industry in indiana presently receives per admission to riverboats in the state 
during  the indiana horse racing commission ihrc required of any revenue received from the subsidy to be used for purse expenses  breed development and reimbursement of approved marketing costs 
the balance  with a ceiling of million  was received by hoosier park 
at the start of  the ihrc lifted the million ceiling and now requires an allocation of of any subsidy revenue to purse expenses and breed development 
a second racetrack in indiana  indiana downs  was opened on december  and the remaining of the subsidy was shared between hoosier park and indiana downs based on the number of live race days during to the extent that hoosier park and indiana downs each run at least days of approved standardbred and thoroughbred live racing during  the subsidy revenue will be split evenly between the two racetracks reducing hoosier park s subsidy revenues by approximately million 
prior to passage of new legislation introduced during the session of the indiana legislature  it is expected that subsidy revenues will be split evenly between indiana racetracks during the first half of and based on purses generated during the latter half of currently it is unknown how future subsidy revenues will be allocated to indiana racetracks 
during the session of the indiana legislature  legislation was introduced to legislate a split of the riverboat subsidy between hoosier park and indiana downs 
the bill was approved by the senate in february and we will continue to monitor its progress as it moves to the house 
additionally  a second bill was introduced  as part of the state budget  which seeks to cap the total horse industry share of the subsidy form riverboat admissions at million 
this bill recently passed the house and we continue to monitor its progress in the state senate 
as a result of the controversy surrounding a breeders cup ultra pick wager  placed on october   we have established  along with the national thoroughbred racing association  inc ntra  the ntra wagering technology group 
the objective of the group is to ensure the security of pari mutuel wagering systems and to eliminate concerns of racing patrons as to the integrity of such systems 
although this controversy involves a vendor of the company  our concerns and rigorous actions are grounded in our interest to protect our patrons 
in addition to the steps taken above  we have also taken other actions to further ensure the integrity of our wagering systems 
in an effort to ensure bettors that the odds do not change after the start of a race  effective november   wagering at all of our facilities  excluding hollywood park  will be halted at zero minutes to post or approximately one minute before horses are loaded into the starting gate for each race 
the california horse racing board chrb regulations currently prevent us from implementing these changes at hollywood park 
also  totalisator hubs at our facilities will no longer accept wagers placed through account wagering facilities that do not make recordings of touch tone wagering transactions 
in kentucky  the excise tax credit for racetracks  passed as part of the state budget  ended june  the excise tax credit resulted in a credit of million during for horsemen incentives and capital improvements at churchill downs 
the excise tax credit was introduced again in the state budget  which passed march  the measure results in a  credit against our excise tax liablity for each day of live racing starting july  and ending june  and is earmarked for horsemen s incentives and necessary capital improvements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our most significant estimates relate to the valuation of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  which may be significantly affected by changes in the regulatory environment in which the company operates  and to the aggregate costs for self insured liability claims 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k annual report 
our business can be impacted positively and negatively by legislative changes such as those previously described and from alternative gaming competition 
significant negative changes resulting from these activities could result in a significant impairment of our property and equipment and or our goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards 
additional information regarding how our business can be impacted by competition and legislative changes are included in item f and g  respectively  in this form k 
for our business insurance renewal effective march   we assumed more risk than in the prior years  primarily through higher retentions and higher maximum losses for stop loss insurance for certain coverages 
our march  business insurance renewals included substantially the same coverages and rentions as the renewal 
based on our historical loss experience  management does not anticipate that this increased risk assumption will materially impact our results of operations 
we are currently pursuing the divestiture of our ellis park racetrack 
if a sale occurs  we plan to use any net proceeds to reduce our debt 
during  we reduced the carrying value of the buildings  equipment and furniture and fixtures of ellis park to reflect their estimated fair value in a divestiture transaction 
should a transaction not be completed at the currently estimated sales price  an additional write down of these assets could occur

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had million of debt outstanding under our revolving loan facility  which bears interest at libor based variable rates 
we are exposed to market risk on variable rate debt due to potential adverse changes in the libor rate 
assuming the outstanding balance on the revolving loan facility remains constant  a one percentage point increase in the libor rate would reduce annual pre tax earnings  recorded fair value and cash flows by million 
in order to mitigate a portion of the market risk associated with our variable rate debt  we have entered into an interest rate swap contract with a major financial institution 
under terms of the separate contract we received a libor based variable interest rate and paid a fixed interest rate of on a notional amount of million  which matured on march  assuming the notional amount under the interest rate swap contract remains constant between january  and march   when the swap expired  a one percentage point increase in the libor rate would increase pre tax earnings  recorded fair value and cash flows by million
