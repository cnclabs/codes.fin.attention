the following information relates to our office facilities in pleasanton  california in december  we entered into a synthetic lease for a new office facility in pleasanton  california 
this synthetic lease is structured as an operating lease with rental payments commencing upon the completion of the construction  which occurred during the fourth quarter of  and runs for years from that date 
the cost for the construction of the facility totaled million including interest during the construction period 
the rental payments equal the amount of interest which accrues on amounts funded prior to the commencement of the lease payments 
the interest rate charged was libor plus as measured on the date of each funding rollover 
we began accruing interest concurrent with the lessor s first drawdown of the construction commitment in january throughout the construction period  the accrued interest amount  which was approximately million as of the end of the construction phase  was added to the construction cost 
in  we negotiated an amendment to this lease that extended the term of the lease until february  with an option to renew for an additional three years  subject to certain conditions  or purchase the facility for million 
if at the end of the lease term we do not purchase the property  we have guaranteed a residual value to the lessor equal to of the lessor s cost of the facility 
as such  the maximum potential loss exposure related to this guarantee is million 
under this lease  we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants  are prohibited from making certain payments  including cash dividends and are subject to various other restrictions 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
as described in subsequent event  under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  on february   the company exercised its million option to purchase the office facility under this lease agreement 
in september  we purchased two parcels of land in pleasanton  california for million and entered into a five year synthetic lease agreement for facilities to be constructed on one of the parcels 
this synthetic lease was structured as an operating lease with rental payments due upon completion of the construction  which occurred during the first quarter of the cost for the construction of the facility totaled million including interest costs during the construction period  which were added to the balance rather than paid 
the rental payments equal the amount of interest accruing on the obligation 
the interest rate is a libor based floating rate  which resets on a   or month interval at our election 
we have an option to renew the lease for an additional five years  subject to certain conditions or purchase the facility for million 
if at the end of the lease term we do not purchase the property  we have guaranteed a residual value to the lessor equal to of the lessor s cost of the facility 
as such  the maximum potential loss exposure related to this guarantee is million 
under this lease  we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants  are prohibited from making certain payments  including cash dividends and are subject to various other restrictions 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
in september  we entered into agreements to sell and simultaneously lease back a substantial portion of the space related to the office buildings and corresponding land that we owned in pleasanton  california 
the sales price of approximately million resulted in a gain of approximately million  which is being amortized over the lease period 
the original lease term was years with options to terminate up to of the space after the initial four years of the lease term and the remaining at any time following the fifth year of the lease term 
alternatively  we could have extended the term of the lease in five year increments up to years 
in the third quarter of  we exercised our option to terminate approximately of the leased space  effective september in the third quarter of  we exercised our second option to terminate all our remaining lease space  effective september  due to our decision to construct a new office building  which is discussed below 
termination fees of million have been accrued over the initial term of the lease agreement 
in may  we began construction of a  square foot office building on acres of land that we own adjacent to our existing corporate headquarters in pleasanton  california 
we anticipate that the building will cost approximately million and will be completed in the third quarter of item legal proceedings peoplesoft is party to various legal disputes and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of general business activities 
in the opinion of management  resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of the operations and cash flows 
however  depending on the amount and the timing  an unfavorable resolution of some or all of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 
forward looking statement item submission of matters to a vote of security holders no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of part ii item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters a our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market nasdaq under the symbol psft

high low fourth quarter of third quarter of second quarter of first quarter of fourth quarter of third quarter of second quarter of first quarter of we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock 
in addition  certain lease agreements for our pleasanton  california corporate headquarters facilities prohibit the payment of cash dividends without the lessor s consent 
b as of march   the approximate number of stockholders of record was  other information certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving peoplesoft more difficult  even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of the stockholders 
in addition  we have  shares of authorized preferred stock which we may issue in the future without further stockholder approval and upon such terms and conditions  and having such rights  privileges and preferences  as the board of directors may determine 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 
under a stockholder rights plan adopted in  each share of our common stock carries the right  under certain circumstances  to purchase equity securities of peoplesoft or an acquirer 
ten days after a tender offer or acquisition of or more of our common stock  each right may be exercised for to purchase one one thousandth of one share of our series a participating preferred stock 
each one one thousandth of each share of series a participating preferred stock will generally be afforded economic rights similar to one share of common stock 
in addition after such rights are triggered  each right entitles the holder to purchase common stock with a fair value of twice the exercise price or  in certain circumstances  securities of the acquiring company for the exercise price 
each right expires in february  and  during specified periods  we may redeem or exchange each right for or one share of common stock  respectively

revenues our software products are generally licensed to end user customers under non exclusive  perpetual license agreements 
revenue from license fees decreased by to million in from million in and increased by in from million in the decrease in revenue from license fees in was primarily due to a global economic downturn during the increase in revenue from license fees in resulted primarily from increased licensing activity following the general availability of peoplesoft applications in we began shipping our first pure internet application suite  peoplesoft  in september and began shipping peoplesoft crm in june our services revenue consists of software maintenance fees  consulting fees  customer training fees and other miscellaneous fees 
revenue from services increased by to  million in from  million in and increased by in from  million in the increase in services revenue in was primarily attributable to an increase in maintenance revenue of million  partially offset by decreases in consulting revenue of million and training revenue of million 
the increase in maintenance revenue is primarily attributable to the growth of our installed base of software applications  arising from sales to both new and existing customers 
the decrease in consulting and training revenue is primarily attributable to the global economic downturn 
the increase in services revenue in was primarily attributable to an increase in maintenance revenue of million  consulting revenue of million and training revenue of million 
the increase in maintenance revenue was primarily attributable to the growth of our installed base of software applications  arising from sales to both new and existing customers 
the increase in consulting and training revenue was primarily attributable to the increased license contracting activity following the general availability of peoplesoft in reductions or slowdowns in our license activity during a given quarter may adversely impact our future services revenue  since these revenues typically follow license activity 
our ability to maintain or increase services revenue in the future depends primarily on our ability to increase our installed customer base  resubscribe existing customers to maintenance agreements  and to maintain or increase our current levels of our professional services business 
revenue from development and other services decreased by to million in from million in and decreased in from million in cost of development and other services decreased by to million in from million in and decreased in from million in revenue from development and other services and the related cost of development and other services decreased in  as momentum business applications  inc momentum exhausted its development funding 
the decreases in are due to a lower amount of active development projects as compared to as well as reduced funding available for development projects 
on april   we closed a transaction to purchase all the outstanding class a common stock of momentum 
refer to business combinations for further discussion 
in the future  the company does not expect to have any further development and other services revenues 
revenues by segment at december   we were organized by geographic areas  in two operating segments north america  which includes operations in the us and canada  and international  which includes operations in all other regions 
revenues from external customers were in thousands years ended december  north america international segment revenues other total revenues total revenues from the north america segment decreased by to  million in from  million in and increased by in from  million in as a percentage of total segment revenues  revenues from the north america segment were in  in and in the dollar decrease in revenues from to from the north america segment is primarily due to the global economic downturn in the dollar increase in revenues from to from the north america segment is primarily attributable to the sales of additional peoplesoft applications to our existing installed base and revenues related to new customers licensing software and contracting for services 
total revenues from the international segment decreased by to million in from million in and increased in from million in as a percentage of total segment revenues  revenues from the international segment were in  in and in the dollar decrease in revenues from to from the international segment is primarily due to the global economic downturn in the dollar increase in revenues from to from the international segment resulted primarily from increased sales attributable to increased globalization of our applications and increased focus on our international operations 
revenues from the europe middle east africa region represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in and no other international region had revenues equal to or greater than of total revenues in  or revenues attributable to the us were  million in   million in and  million in revenues originated in each individual foreign country were less than of total revenues during  and  with the exception of canada in canada had revenues which comprised of total revenues in development and other services revenue is not considered segment revenue and as such is designated as other for segment disclosure purposes 
costs and expenses our software products are based on a combination of internally developed and acquired technology  as well as bundled third party products and technology 
cost of license fees consists principally of royalties  license fees for certain third party software products  amortization of capitalized software costs and product warranty costs 
cost of license fees decreased to million in from million in and increased in from million in the decrease in cost of license fees in is primarily a result of a million decrease in third party royalty expense resulting from decreased license fee revenue on which such royalties are calculated and an million decrease in product warranty costs resulting from a decline in the number of warranty claims 
these decreases are partially offset by a million increase in forward looking statement amortization related to software obtained through acquisitions 
the increase in the cost of license fees in is primarily a result of a million increase in third party royalty expense resulting from increased license fee revenue and a million increase in product warranty costs 
cost of services consists primarily of employee costs and the related infrastructure costs incurred in providing consulting services  post installation support and training 
cost of services decreased to million in from million in and increased in from million in  representing  and of services revenue in those years 
the decrease in cost of services in is primarily due to a million decrease in employee compensation and benefit costs related to decreased incentive compensation expense and headcount reductions  a million expense decrease related to the reduction in the utilization of outside consultants  and a million decrease in service warranty costs resulting from a decline in the number of warranty claims  as well as general expense reductions associated with improved cost management in the consulting organization 
the increase in cost of services in is primarily the result of an increase in the average headcount  as compared to  which was required to support the growth in the installed customer base 
if the demand for services from new and existing customers for installation  consulting  maintenance and training services increases over the next several quarters  we anticipate that our cost of services may increase 
sales and marketing expense was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in those years 
the increase in sales and marketing expense in is primarily attributable to a million increase in salaries due to sales and marketing headcount increases and a million increase in travel expense consistent with the increase in headcount  partially offset by a million decrease in sales commissions related to decreased license fee revenue and a million decrease in marketing programs and advertising 
the increase in sales and marketing expense in is primarily attributable to costs associated with the growth in the sales force and increased marketing campaigns 
sales and marketing expense may increase in future periods as we increase our sales force and marketing and advertising expenses to improve our competitive positioning in the marketplace and to promote brand awareness and global recognition of our products 
product development expense consists of costs primarily related to our software developers and the associated infrastructure costs required to fund product development initiatives 
product development expense was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in those years 
the increase in product development expense in is related to the decrease in development costs billed to momentum as developers were redeployed to work on internal development initiatives 
the decrease in product development expense in is primarily attributable to fewer outside contractors being used for development initiatives as a result of the completion of peoplesoft in in  we capitalized product development costs of million 
we did not capitalize any development costs in or  other than product development costs acquired through business combinations or purchased from third parties 
our current focus is to continue to extend our software offerings by delivering enhanced functionality and further develop new applications in our integrated application suites human capital management  financial management solutions  customer relationship management and supply chain management 
general and administrative expense was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in those years 
the decrease in general and administrative expense in is primarily attributable to a million decrease in the amortization of goodwill in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas on january   a million decrease in non product related litigation expense  a million decrease in telecommunications costs  a million decrease in bad debt expense associated with process improvements related to our accounts receivable collections and general expense reductions associated with improved cost management 
the increase in general and administrative expense in is partially due to a increase in average administrative headcount from and forward looking statement commensurate increases in employee compensation and benefit costs and general and administrative infrastructure investments made during the year 
furthermore  we recorded an additional million in non product related litigation expense and an additional million in our provision for doubtful accounts during product exit charges we did not record any product exit charges in or during the third quarter of  we recorded product exit charges in the amount of million related to the impairment and write off of the unamortized cost of capitalized software  customer list and goodwill related to two products acquired as part of the intrepid systems  inc and trimark technologies  inc business combinations 
restructuring  acquisition and other charges the following table sets forth the components of restructuring  acquisition and other charges in thousands years ended december  restructuring reserves adjustments acquired in process research and development other restructuring  acquisition and other charges restructuring reserves adjustments of million  million and million in  and consist of favorable adjustments to existing restructuring reserves to reflect then current estimates 
acquired in process research and development charges of million in are attributable to a million charge related to the annuncio software  inc business combination and a million charge related to the acquisition of momentum business applications  inc acquired in process research and development charges of million in are attributable to a million charge related to an acquisition which was otherwise insignificant to peoplesoft and a million charge related to the acquisition of skillsvillage  inc for additional discussion of the acquired in process research and development charges see business combinations 
in the future  if we consummate business combinations and technology purchases  we may incur additional in process research and development charges which may impact our results of operations 
other income  net the following table sets forth the components of other income  net in thousands years ended december  interest income interest expense gain on sale of equity securities other other income  net the decrease in interest income during was primarily due to a decrease in interest rates 
the gain on sale of equity securities in relates to the sale of investments in publicly traded start up companies

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas  the valuation of these net deferred tax assets is based upon an estimate of both the timing and amount of future taxable income 
future taxable income may be derived from future operations  subsequent reversals of deferred tax liabilities and other sources 
business combinations during the two years ended december   we completed the acquisitions of momentum business applications  inc momentum and skillsvillage  inc skillsvillage and acquired technology from annuncio software  inc annuncio 
these transactions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the results of operations subsequent to the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  during the three years ended december   we completed five other acquisitions that were not significant to our financial statements 
as part of our strategy we anticipate additional acquisition activity 
future acquisitions may be significant to us on either an individual or an aggregate basis 
annuncio software  inc in january  we purchased the intellectual property and certain assets of annuncio  a privately held company  for million in cash 
the transaction was treated as an acquisition of a business and was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the intellectual property of annuncio consists of marketing automation software solutions for email and web based customer interactions 
we allocated the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible liabilities acquired of million to the following intangible assets million to goodwill  million to capitalized software  million to in process research and development  million to non compete agreements  million to customer relationships and million to other intangible assets 
the capitalized intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of one to three years 
amounts allocated to in process research and development were expensed as restructuring  acquisition and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  because the purchased research and development had no alternative uses  and had not reached technological feasibility 
the in process research and development related to additional functionality for annuncio s marketing automation software products 
at the date of the acquisition  the annuncio products under development were approximately complete and were subsequently completed during the first quarter of at a cost of approximately million 
in performing the purchase price allocation  we considered  among other factors  our future use of the acquired assets and analyses of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of annuncio s products 
we estimated that we would recognize revenue on the projects related to the in process technology from to the projected incremental cash flows were discounted to their present value using discount rates of and for developed and in process technology 
these discount rates were determined after consideration of our rate of return on debt capital and equity  the weighted average return on invested capital and the risks associated with achieving anticipated sales related to the technology acquired from annuncio 
risks include achieving anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  successful forward looking statement completion of various research and development efforts  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
our financial projections may ultimately prove to be inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
therefore  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast revenues and costs to develop such projects will transpire as projected 
momentum business applications  inc on january   we exercised an option to purchase all the outstanding class a common stock of momentum for million in cash 
the transaction closed in april and was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible liabilities acquired of million to the following assets and liabilities million to deferred tax assets  million to capitalized software  million to in process research and development and million to deferred tax liabilities 
the capitalized software products are being amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of five years 
amounts allocated to in process research and development were expensed as restructuring  acquisition and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations because the purchased research and development had no alternative uses and had not reached technological feasibility 
fourteen in process research and development projects were identified 
five projects related to human capital management application suites and accounted for of the amount allocated to in process research and development 
a portal application project accounted for of the amount allocated to in process research and development 
various other projects accounted for the remaining allocated to in process research and development 
at december   the momentum products in process were expected to be completed by the first half of the remaining efforts primarily include completion of coding and system and platform testing 
in performing the purchase price allocation  we considered  among other factors  future use of the acquired assets  analyses of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of momentum s products  and an analysis of future royalty payments payable to momentum by us 
an estimation of the future royalty payments that we would not be required to pay was the basis for the valuation analysis 
we estimated that we would avoid royalty payments on the projects related to the in process technology from to the after tax royalty savings was discounted to its present value using discount rates of and for developed and in process technology 
these discount rates were determined after consideration of our rate of return on debt capital and equity  the weighted average return on invested capital and the risks associated with achieving anticipated sales related to the technology acquired from momentum 
risks included achieving anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  successful completion of various research and development efforts  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
our financial projections may ultimately prove to be inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
therefore  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast revenues and costs to develop such projects will transpire as projected 
skillsvillage  inc on may   we acquired the assets and assumed liabilities of skillsvillage  in a business combination accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the assets acquired included technology to automate the procurement and management of contract services 
the aggregate purchase price of million included the issuance of  shares of our common stock with a fair value of million  the issuance of options to skillsvillage employees to purchase common stock with a fair value of million  forward looking statement and cash payments of million 
terms of the business combination called for million in cash and shares of common stock to be placed into escrow for a period of months to satisfy certain liabilities or claims 
after the term of the escrow elapsed  in may  escrow amounts of million were accounted for as additional purchase price and were distributed to former skillsvillage shareholders 
the remaining amounts in escrow were returned to the company 
we allocated the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired of million to the following intangible assets million to goodwill  million to completed products and technology  million to in process research and development and million to assembled workforce 
the capitalized completed products and technology are being amortized based on an estimated useful life of four years 
amounts allocated to in process research and development were expensed as restructuring  acquisition and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations because the purchased research and development had no alternative uses and had not reached technological feasibility 
the in process research and development relates to additional functionality for skillsvillage s software 
at the date of the acquisition  the skillsvillage product under development was approximately complete and was subsequently completed during the third quarter of at a cost of approximately million 
in performing the purchase price allocation  we considered  among other factors  future use of the acquired assets and analyses of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of skillsvillage s products 
the projected incremental cash flows were discounted back to their present value using discount rates of and for developed and in process technology  respectively 
these discount rates were determined after consideration of our rate of return on debt capital and equity  the weighted average return on invested capital and the risks associated with achieving anticipated sales related to the technology acquired from skillsvillage 
risks included achieving anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
our financial projections may ultimately prove to be inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
therefore  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast revenues and costs to develop such projects will transpire as projected 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe policies and estimates related to revenue recognition  capitalized software  allowance for doubtful accounts  product and service warranty reserve and deferred tax asset valuation allowance represent our critical accounting policies and estimates 
future results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from the following sources software license revenue and services revenue  which primarily consists of maintenance  consulting and training 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commissions staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and other authoritative accounting literature 
license fee revenue 
for software license agreements that do not require significant modification or customization of the software  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
our consulting services generally do not involve significant modification or customization of the licensed software 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
the fair value of the undelivered elements is determined based on the historical evidence of stand alone sales of these elements to third parties 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
if the license fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payment becomes due  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we consider arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable 
revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized when we receive persuasive evidence that the reseller has sold the products to an end user customer 
if provided in a license agreement  acceptance provisions generally grant customers a right of refund or replacement only if the licensed software does not perform in accordance with its published specifications 
we believe the likelihood of non acceptance in these situations is remote and generally recognize revenue when all other criteria of revenue recognition are met 
if such a determination cannot be made  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written acceptance or when the acceptance period has lapsed 
services revenue 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  typically one year 
consulting and training revenues are usually charged on a time and materials basis and are recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from certain fixed price contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion basis  which involves the use of estimates 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure the progress towards completion  revenue is recognized when the project is completed or when we receive final acceptance from the customer 
capitalized software we account for the development cost of software intended for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  sfas 
sfas requires product development costs to be charged to expense as incurred until technological feasibility is attained 
technological feasibility is attained when our software has completed system testing and has been determined viable for its intended use 
the time between the attainment of technological feasibility and completion of software development has been short with immaterial amounts of development costs incurred during this period 
accordingly  we did not capitalize any development costs in or  other than product development costs acquired through business combinations or purchased from third parties 
we capitalize software acquired through technology purchases and business combinations if the related software under development has reached technological feasibility or if there are alternative future uses for the software 
we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software based on estimated future gross revenues reduced by the estimated cost of completing the products and of performing maintenance and customer support 
if our gross revenues were to be significantly less than our estimates  the net realizable value of our capitalized software intended for sale would be impaired 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
we record an allowance for receivables based on a percentage of revenues 
additionally  individual overdue accounts are reviewed  and an additional allowance is recorded when determined necessary to state receivables at realizable value 
in judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  and the aging of our receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
product and service warranty reserve we provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims received  provided that it is probable that a liability exists  and provided the cost to repair or otherwise satisfy the claim can be reasonably estimated 
the amount of the reserve recorded is equal to the costs to repair or otherwise satisfy the claim 
if existing claims are settled for amounts which differ from our estimates  or if the estimated monetary value of the future warranty claims were to increase or decrease  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and the warranty expense would change from current levels 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
however  adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is greater or less than the amount we have recorded 
our valuation allowance relates to established allowances on net operating losses incurred in foreign jurisdictions and other foreign tax benefits as well as on operating loss carryforwards in state jurisdictions of acquired companies 
newly adopted and recently issued accounting standards on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized and that goodwill be tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant 
the application of the provisions of sfas resulted in a reduction of goodwill amortization expense of million for the year ended december  during  we completed our transitional goodwill impairment test comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units as of january  to the carrying value  which includes goodwill and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was not impaired 
at december   we had goodwill of million 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  and elements of apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects on disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual or infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of while maintaining many of the provisions relating to impairment testing and valuation

on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  eitf 
eitf requires companies to characterize reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue and to reclassify prior period financial statements to conform to the current year presentation for comparative purposes 
our services revenue now includes reimbursable out of pocket expenses and cost of services includes the costs associated with reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
prior to the adoption of eitf  our historical financial statements included these expenses as net amounts in cost of services 
the adoption of eitf did not have a significant impact on our services gross margin percentage and had no effect on net income 
reimbursable out of pocket expenses reclassified as services revenue were million and million for the years ended december  and in april  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no

in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  sfas was issued 
this statement provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with disposal activities and is effective for us for restructurings initiated after december  under sfas  companies will record the fair value of exit or disposal costs when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the adoption of sfas may result in us recognizing the cost of future restructuring activities  if any  over a period of time rather than in one reporting period 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires us to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in the issuance of the guarantee 
fin is effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements effective for the year ending december   expand the disclosures required by a guarantor about its obligations under a guarantee 
the adoption of the accounting requirements of this statement did not impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the adoption of the disclosure requirements of this statement resulted in additional disclosures related to our product and service warranty reserve  customer indemnifications and synthetic lease guarantees 
in december  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  sfas was issued 
sfas amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on the reported results 
the disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  and interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of this statement did not impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin that addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation provides guidance for determining when a primary beneficiary should consolidate a variable interest entity  or equivalent structure  that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
the interpretation is effective after january  for newly created variable interest entities 
for variable interest entities created before february   the interpretation is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  this interpretation is applicable to our synthetic lease  entered into in september  under which certain office facilities were constructed in pleasanton  california at a cost of million 
we may be required to consolidate the financial position and operating results related to this synthetic lease if we do not exercise our purchase option before july  subsequent event we have two synthetic lease arrangements related to certain office facilities in pleasanton  california  which were constructed for million and million  as described in further detail in item properties 
we have options to purchase the office facilities under these synthetic lease arrangements 
on february   we exercised our million option to purchase the office facilities under the synthetic lease agreement entered into in december liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and billion in short term investments  consisting principally of investments in interest bearing demand deposit accounts with various financial institutions  tax advantaged money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations and municipalities 
our working capital was billion at december  we believe that the combination of cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances and the potential cash flow from operations will be sufficient  at least through the next twelve months  to satisfy our cash requirements  including million for the contemplated purchases of certain office facilities under our synthetic lease arrangements and the expected purchases of property and equipment 
cash provided by operating activities was million during  million during and million during the decrease in cash from operating activities during is primarily due to a decrease in the tax benefit from employee stock transactions  a decrease in the cash from accounts receivable and a decrease in cash from accounts payable  accrued liabilities and accrued compensation  partially offset by an increase in cash provided from refunded income taxes 
the increase in cash from operating activities during is primarily due to an increase in net income  decrease in accounts receivable  increase in depreciation and amortization  decrease in the gain on sale of investments and increase in the tax benefits from exercise of stock options  partially offset by the decrease in deferred revenues and cash received from sale of accounts receivable 
cash used in investing activities was million during  million during and million during our principal use of cash in investing activities during resulted from net purchases of investments  principally of a short term duration  of million  purchases of property and equipment of million and acquisitions of million  net of cash acquired

forward looking statement contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect these contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions 
payments due by period after total year or less years years operating leases a a under certain office facility leases in pleasanton  california  we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants  are prohibited from making certain payments  including cash dividends and are subject to various other restrictions 
commercial commitments synthetic leases we lease certain office facilities in pleasanton  california under synthetic lease arrangements  which are accounted for as operating leases 
the combined cost for the construction of the facilities was million and we pay interest to the lessors based on libor plus a margin 
we have options to renew the leases or purchase the related facilities that are exercisable in february for million and in september for the remaining million 
if at the end of the lease terms  we do not purchase the properties  we have guaranteed residual values equal to of the lessor s cost of construction 
as such  the maximum potential loss exposure related to these guarantees is million 
based on current real estate market conditions  we do not believe that it is probable that we will incur a loss related to these guarantees 
under these leases  we are required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants  are prohibited from making certain payments  including cash dividends and are subject to various other restrictions 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
as described in subsequent event  under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  on february   we elected to exercise our option to purchase office facilities for million under the synthetic lease arrangement entered into in december forward looking statement factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this annual report on form k contain descriptions of our expectations regarding future trends affecting our business that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  forecast  intended  may  plan  project  predict  should and will and similar expressions as they relate to peoplesoft are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
forward looking statements contained throughout this annual report include  but are not limited to  those identified with a footnote symbol 
we may also make other forward looking statements from time to time  both written and oral 
forward looking statements apply as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to update the information to reflect changes that occur after that date 
the actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this report 
we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section describes some  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties that we believe may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained elsewhere in this report 
continued regional and or global economic  political and market conditions may cause a decrease in demand for our software and related services which may negatively affect our revenue and operating results 
our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for our software and related services 
regional and or global changes in the economy and financial markets and political instability in geographic areas have resulted in companies reducing spending for technology projects generally and the delay or reconsideration of potential purchases of our products and related services 
the prospect of a prolonged war may further impact the purchasing decisions of current or potential customers 
future declines in demand for our products and or services could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
our quarterly revenues are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially  which may adversely affect our net income 
our revenues and results of operations can be difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
our expense levels  operating costs and hiring plans are based on projections of future revenues 
if our actual revenues fall below expectations  our net income may be adversely affected 
factors that may affect the predictability of actual revenues include the following our sales cycle can vary as a result of the complexity of a customer s overall business needs and may extend over one or more quarters  the complexity and size of license transactions can result in protracted negotiations  a significant number of our license agreements are typically completed within the last few weeks of the quarter and purchasing decisions may be delayed to future quarters  the effect of economic downturns and political conditions may result in decreased product demand  price erosion  and other factors that may substantially reduce license and services revenue  customers may unexpectedly postpone or cancel anticipated system replacement or new system implementation due to changes in strategic priorities  project objectives  budgetary constraints  internal purchasing processes or company management  changes in our competitors and our own pricing policies and discount plans may affect customer purchasing patterns and decisions  and the number  timing and significance of our competitors and our own software product enhancements and new software product announcements may affect purchasing decisions 
our future revenue is dependent in part upon our installed customer base continuing to license additional products  renew maintenance and purchase additional services 
our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional new license and service revenues 
maintenance is generally renewable annually at a customer s option  and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
in addition  customers may not necessarily license additional products or contract for additional services or maintenance 
if our customers fail to renew their maintenance or license additional products or contract for additional services  our revenues could decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected 
we may be required to defer recognition of license revenue for a significant period of time after entering into an agreement  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
we may have to delay recognizing license related revenue for a significant period of time for a variety of types of transactions  including transactions that include both currently deliverable software products and software products that are under development or contain other currently undeliverable elements  transactions where the customer demands services that include significant modifications  customizations or complex interfaces that could delay product delivery or acceptance  transactions that involve non standard acceptance criteria or identified product related performance issues  and transactions that include contingency based payment terms or fees 
these factors and other specific accounting requirements for software revenue recognition  require that we have very precise terms in our license agreements to allow us to recognize revenue when we initially deliver software or perform services 
although we have a standard form of license agreement that meets the criteria for current revenue recognition on delivered elements  we negotiate and revise these terms and conditions in some transactions 
sometimes we may license our software or provide service with terms and conditions that do not permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or even as work on the project is completed 
if accounting interpretations relating to revenue recognition change  our reported revenues could decline or we could be forced to make changes in our business practices 
over the past several years  the american institute of certified public accountants has issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
in addition  in december  the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab which explains how the sec staff believes existing revenue recognition rules should be applied to or interpreted for transactions not specifically addressed by existing rules 
these standards address software revenue recognition matters primarily from a conceptual level and do not include specific implementation guidance 
we believe that our revenue has been recognized in compliance with sop  sop and sab however  the accounting profession and regulatory agencies continue to discuss various provisions of these pronouncements with the objective of providing additional guidance on their application 
these discussions and the issuance of new interpretations  once finalized  could lead to unanticipated reductions in recognized revenue 
they could also drive significant adjustments to our business practices which could result in increased administrative costs  lengthened sales cycles and other changes which could adversely affect our reported revenues and results of operations 
increases in services revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins and adversely affect our operating results 
we realize lower margins on services revenue than on license revenues 
in addition  we may contract with certain third parties to supplement the services we provide to customers  which generally yields lower gross margins than our service business 
as a result  if services revenue increases as a percentage of total revenue or if we increase our use of third parties to provide such services  our gross margins will be lower and our operating results may be adversely affected 
acquisitions may present risks  and we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals intended at the time of any acquisition 
as a component of our strategy  we acquire or invest in companies  products or technologies  and may enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies 
the risks we commonly encounter in such transactions include we may have difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company  we may have difficulty effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  our ongoing business may be disrupted by transition and integration issues  we may not be able to retain key technical and managerial personnel from the acquired business  we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses  we may have difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures and policies during the transition and integration  our relationships with partner companies or third party providers of technology or products could be adversely affected  our relationships with employees and customers could be impaired  our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture  legal and financial contingencies  and product development  among other things  and we may be required to sustain significant exit charges if products acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful 
our margins may be reduced if we need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms on our products and services to meet competitive pressures in our industry 
we compete with a variety of software vendors in all of our major product lines  including vendors of enterprise application software  manufacturing software applications  crm applications  human capital management software and financial management solutions software 
in addition  we compete with numerous small firms that offer products with new or advanced features 
some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their significant worldwide presence  longer operating and product development history  and substantially greater technical and marketing resources  or exclusive intellectual property rights 
at least one competitor has a larger installed base than we do 
if competitors offer more favorable pricing  payment terms  contractual implementation terms  or product or service warranties  or offer product functionality which we do not currently provide  we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully 
any such changes would be likely to reduce margins and may adversely affect operating results 
if we fail to compete effectively and introduce new or improved products and service offerings  our results of operations and the financial condition of the business will suffer 
the market for our software products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the competitive environment demands that we constantly improve our existing products and create new products 
our future success may depend in part upon our ability to improve our existing products and develop new ones to keep pace with technological developments  including developments related to the internet  successfully integrate third party products  enter new markets  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements  and maintain market acceptance 
if we are unable to meet these challenges  our results of operations and our financial condition will be adversely affected 
market acceptance of new platforms and operating environments may require us to undergo the expense of developing and maintaining compatible product lines 
although our software products can be licensed for use with a variety of popular industry standard relational database management system platforms  there may be future or existing platforms that achieve popularity in the marketplace which may not be architecturally compatible with our software product design 
moreover  future or existing user interfaces that achieve popularity within the business application marketplace may or may not be architecturally compatible with our current software product design 
developing and maintaining consistent software product performance characteristics across all of these combinations could place a significant strain on our resources and software product release schedules which could adversely affect revenue and results of operations 
to maintain software performance across accepted platforms and operating environments  or to achieve market acceptance of those that we support  or to adapt to popular new ones  our expenses may increase and our sales and revenues may be adversely affected 
as our international business grows  we will become increasingly subject to currency risks and other costs and contingencies that could adversely affect our results 
we continue to invest in the expansion of our international operations 
the global reach of our business could cause us to be subject to unexpected  uncontrollable and rapidly changing economic and political conditions that could adversely affect our results of operations 
the following factors  among others  present risks that could have an adverse impact on our business conducting business in currencies other than united states dollars subjects us to currency controls and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  inability to hedge the currency risk in some transactions because of uncertainty or the inability to reasonably estimate our foreign exchange exposure  increased cost and development time required to adapt our products to local markets  lack of experience in a particular geographic market  legal  regulatory  social  political  labor or economic uncertainties in a specific country or region  including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs  increased withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries  import and export license requirements  trade tariffs or restrictions  war  terrorism and civil unrest  and higher operating costs due to local laws or regulation 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to retain and attract qualified employees 
we believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to train  retain  effectively manage and attract highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
if our efforts in these areas are not successful  our costs may increase  development and sales efforts may be hindered and our customer service may be degraded 
although we invest significant resources in recruiting and retaining employees  there is intense competition for personnel in the software industry 
from time to time  we experience difficulties in locating enough highly qualified candidates in desired geographic locations  or with required industry specific expertise 
the loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations and stock price 
we believe that there are certain key employees within the organization  primarily in the senior management team  who are necessary for us to meet our objectives 
due to the competitive employment nature of the software industry  there is a risk that we will not be able to retain these key employees 
the loss of one or more key employees could adversely affect our continued operations 
in addition  uncertainty created by turnover of key employees could result in reduced confidence in our financial performance which could cause fluctuations in our stock price and result in further turnover of our employees 
we may be required to undertake a costly redesign of our products if third party software development tools become an industry standard 
our software products include a suite of proprietary software development tools  known as peopletools  which are fundamental to their effective use 
while no industry standard exists for software development tools  several companies have focused on providing software development tools and each of them is attempting to establish its own as the accepted industry standard 
if a software product were to emerge as a clearly established and widely accepted industry standard  we may not be able to adapt peopletools appropriately or rapidly enough to satisfy market demand 
in addition  we could be forced to abandon or modify peopletools or to redesign our software products to accommodate the new industry standard 
this would be expensive and time consuming and may adversely affect results of operations and the financial condition of the business 
our failure to drive or adapt to new and changing industry standards or third party interfaces could adversely affect sales of our products and services 
a decline in customers ability or willingness to migrate software applications to an internet architecture could adversely affect continued market acceptance and sales of peoplesoft and future internet based products 
with peoplesoft  use of a web browser as the user interface replaces the traditional desktop access through networked microsoft windows based personal computers 
dependable access to software applications via the internet or an intranet involves numerous risks  including security  availability and reliability 
there is a risk that some customers will not be willing or able to implement internet based applications 
if they do not  our revenues may be reduced and results of operations may be adversely affected 
increased scope and complexity of our software may result in more difficult detection and correction of errors  delays in the introduction of new products and more costly performance and warranty claims 
our software programs  like all software programs generally  may contain a number of undetected errors despite internal and third party testing 
increased complexity of the software and more sophisticated expectations of customers may result in higher costs to correct such errors and delay the introduction of new products or enhancements in the marketplace 
product software errors could subject us to litigation and liability based on performance and or warranty claims 
although our agreements contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential liability claims  these provisions could be invalidated by unfavorable judicial decisions or by federal  state  local or foreign laws or regulations 
if a claim against us were to be successful  we might be required to incur significant expense and pay substantial damages 
even if we were to prevail  the accompanying publicity could adversely impact the demand for our products 
if we lose access to critical third party software or technology  our costs could increase and the introduction of new products and product enhancements could be delayed 
we license software and technology from third parties  including some competitors  and incorporate it into our own software products  some of which is critical to the operation of our software 
if any of the third party software vendors were to change product offerings  increase prices or terminate our licenses  we might need to seek alternative vendors and incur additional internal or external development costs to ensure continued performance of our products 
such alternatives may not be available on attractive terms  or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the software provided by our existing vendors 
if the cost of licensing or maintaining these third party software products or other technology significantly increases  our gross margin levels could significantly decrease 
in addition  interruption in functionality of our products could adversely affect future sales of licenses and services 
disruption of our relationships with third party systems integrators could adversely affect revenues and results of operations 
we build and maintain strong working relationships with businesses that we believe play an important role in the successful marketing and deployment of our software application products 
our current and potential customers often rely on third party system integrators to develop  deploy and manage applications 
we believe that our relationships with these companies enhance our marketing and sales efforts 
however  if these system integrators are unable to recruit and adequately train a sufficient number of consulting personnel to support the successful implementation of our software products  we may lose customers 
moreover  our relationships with these companies are not exclusive  and they are free to start  or in some cases increase  the marketing of competitive business application software  or to otherwise discontinue their relationships with us 
in addition  integrators who generate consulting fees from customers by providing implementation services may be less likely to recommend our software if our products are more difficult or costly to install than competitors similar product offerings 
disruption of our relationships with these companies could adversely affect revenues and results of operations 
our intellectual property and proprietary rights may offer only limited protection 
we consider certain aspects of our internal operations  and our software and documentation to be proprietary  and we primarily rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary rights 
patent applications or issued patents  as well as trademark  copyright  and trade secret rights  may not provide significant protection or competitive advantage 
we also rely on contractual restrictions in our agreements with customers  employees and others to protect our intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our patents  copyrights  trademarks or trade secrets will not otherwise become known 
moreover  the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary intellectual property rights as effectively as do the laws of the united states 
protecting and defending our intellectual property rights could be costly regardless of venue 
through an escrow arrangement  we have granted some of our customers a contingent future right to use our source code solely for internal maintenance services 
if our source code is accessed through an escrow  the likelihood of misappropriation or other misuse of our intellectual property may increase 
third parties may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights  which could result in material costs 
third parties may assert infringement claims against us more aggressively in the future  especially in light of recent developments in patent law expanding the scope of patents on software and business methods 
these assertions  regardless of their validity  could result in costly and time consuming litigation  including damage awards  or could require costly redesign of products or present the need to enter into royalty arrangements which would decrease margins and could adversely affect the results of operations 
we may be unable to achieve the benefits we anticipate from joint software development or marketing arrangements with our business partners 
we enter into various development or joint business arrangements to develop new software products or extensions to our existing software products 
we may distribute ourselves or jointly sell with our business partners an integrated software product and pay a royalty to the business partner based on end user license fees under these joint business arrangements 
while we intend to develop business applications that are integrated with our software products  these software products may in fact not be integrated or brought to market  or the market may reject the integrated enterprise solution 
as a result  we may not achieve the revenues that we anticipated at the time we entered into the joint business arrangement 
potential terrorist activity may interfere with our ability to conduct business 
potential terrorist attacks on united states interests present a threat to communication systems  information technology and security  damage to buildings and their contents and injury to or death of key employees 
we continue to take steps to increase security and add protections against terrorist threats 
this may require adjustment or change of business practices  which could involve significant capital expenditure and result in loss of focus and distraction of management  development and sales employees 
moreover  an actual or perceived increase in risk of travel due to the prospect of terrorist activity may reduce our ability to demonstrate products and meet with prospective customers  which may adversely affect our ability to close sales and meet projected forecasts 
in addition  our data center near our corporate headquarters in pleasanton  california could be vulnerable to catastrophic events such as a major earthquake  fire  flood or attack 
significant structural damage to the data center could cause a disruption of our information systems and loss of financial data and certain customer data  which could adversely impact results of operations and business financial conditions 
our stock price may remain volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past and may in the future be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following revenue or results of operations in any quarter failing to meet the expectations  published or otherwise  of the investment community  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  introduction of new products or significant customer wins or losses by us or our competitors  developments with respect to our intellectual property rights or those of our competitors  changes in recommendations or financial estimates by securities analysts  rumors or dissemination of false and or misleading information  particularly through internet chat rooms  instant messaging and other means of rapid dissemination  changes in management  conditions and trends in the software industry  announcement of acquisitions or other significant transactions by us or our competitors  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  and general market conditions 
in addition  fluctuations in the price of our common stock may expose us to the risk of securities class action or shareholder derivative lawsuits 
defending against such lawsuits could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
furthermore  any settlement or adverse determination in such a lawsuit could subject us to significant liabilities 
if requirements relating to accounting treatment for employee stock options are changed  we may be forced to change our business practices 
we currently account for the issuance of stock options under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
a shareholder proposal will be presented for consideration at the annual meeting of stockholders  urging the board of directors to adopt a policy that we treat the value of stock options granted to employees as a compensation expense 
if this proposal passes or if other proposals currently under consideration by accounting standards organizations and governmental authorities are adopted  we may be required to change our practice 
as a result  we could decide to reduce the number of stock options granted to employees or to grant options to fewer employees 
this could affect our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates  and increase the cash compensation we would have to pay to them 
in addition  such a change could have a negative effect on our earnings 
it may become increasingly expensive to obtain and maintain liability insurance at current levels 
we contract for insurance to cover a variety of potential risks and liabilities 
in the current market  insurance coverage is becoming more restrictive  and when insurance coverage is offered  the deductible for which we are responsible is larger 
in light of these circumstances  it may become more difficult to maintain insurance coverage at historical levels  or if such coverage is available  the cost to obtain or maintain it may increase substantially 
this may result in our being forced to bear the burden of an increased portion of risks for which we have traditionally been covered by insurance  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of peoplesoft or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us more difficult  even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of the stockholders 
these provisions include adoption of a preferred shares rights agreement  commonly known as a poison pill and giving our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 
the above factors and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of peoplesoft  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of peoplesoft s common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk international sales are made mostly from our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in local currency as well 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to unique economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany transactions in which certain costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign subsidiaries 
intercompany transactions are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiaries in order to centralize foreign exchange risk in the parent company in the united states 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars during consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and may adversely impact overall expected profitability 
we have a foreign exchange hedging program principally designed to mitigate the future potential impact due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
forward exchange contracts are primarily used to hedge foreign currency exposures of the parent company as well as the us dollar denominated exposures of our foreign subsidiaries 
we operate in certain countries in latin america and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets  and thus we also have unhedged exposures in these countries 
in general  our forward foreign exchange contracts have terms of two months or less  which approximate the expected settlement date of the underlying exposure 
gains and losses on the settled contracts are included in other income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and are recognized in the current period  consistent with the period in which the gain or loss of the underlying transaction is recognized 
the foreign currency hedging program is managed in accordance with a corporate policy approved by our board of directors 
in addition to hedging existing transaction exposures  our foreign exchange management policy allows for the hedging of exposure resulting from the translation of foreign subsidiary financial results into us dollars 
such hedges can only be undertaken to the extent that the exposures are highly certain  reasonably estimable and significant in amount 
no such hedges have occurred through december  at december   we had the following outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to exchange foreign currency for us dollars notional weighted notional average exchange functional currency amount rate per us euros million singapore dollars million million we had the following outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to exchange us dollars for foreign currency notional weighted notional average exchange functional currency amount rate per us british pounds million south african rand million canadian dollars million australian dollars million swiss francs million swedish krona million new zealand dollars million taiwan dollars million danish krone million japanese yen million chilean pesos million million at december   each of these contracts matured within days and had a cost that approximated fair value 
neither the cost nor the fair value of these forward foreign exchange contracts was material at december  we recorded net gains from settled contracts and underlying foreign currency exposures of million in and net losses of million in and million in interest rate risk investments in debt securities we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in interest bearing demand deposit accounts with financial institutions  tax exempt money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations and municipalities 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas represent operating balances that are typically invested in short term time deposits in local operating banks 
we classify debt securities based on maturity dates on the date of purchase and reevaluate the classification as of each balance sheet date 
debt securities which management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
all other debt securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  which is determined based on quoted market prices  with net unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  all our investments were classified as available for sale 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities  that typically have a shorter duration  may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may decrease in the future due to changes in interest rates 
at december   the average maturity of our investment securities was less than three months and all investment securities had maturities of less than eighteen months 
the following table presents certain information about our financial instruments at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
due to our tax rate  it is presently advantageous for us to invest largely in tax exempt securities 
the average interest rates shown below reflect a weighted average rate for both taxable and tax exempt forward looking statement investments 
at december   we invested heavily in tax exempt investments which reduced our weighted average interest rate 
below is a presentation of the maturity profile of our investments in debt securities at december  in millions  except interest rates expected maturity year more than principal fair or less year amount value available for sale securities weighted average interest rate interest rate swap transactions we have entered into interest rate swap transactions to manage our exposure to interest rate changes on our synthetic lease obligations 
the swaps involve the exchange of fixed interest rate payments for variable interest rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount 
at december  and  the swaps had an aggregate notional amount of million  and fair values of million and million 
the swaps mature at various dates in  consistent with the maturity dates of the synthetic leases 
under these agreements  we receive a variable rate based on the three month libor set on the last day of the previous quarter and pay a weighted average fixed rate of 
these swaps are designated under statement of financial accounting standards no

accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of december  and included unrealized losses after tax of million and million related to these interest rate swaps 
the unrealized losses at december  of million are estimated to be reclassified into earnings over the remaining life of the swaps based upon a month forward libor rate
