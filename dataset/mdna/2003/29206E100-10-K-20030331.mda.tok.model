as a result of this event  total stockholders equity as of december  has been increased by  certain factors affecting future operating results the company is highly dependent on a few suppliers 
the company purchased approximately of its products from one supplier in and approximately from its three largest suppliers 
as a result  the termination or limitation by one or more of the company s largest suppliers of their relationship with the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  the company s loss of any one of its other suppliers or material default by any such supplier in its obligations to the company due to bankruptcy  financial difficulties  expropriation  social unrest  destruction  sabotage  strikes  acquisition by a person or entity unwilling to provide products to the company  or for any other reason  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company is highly dependent on a few significant customers 
the company s sales are highly concentrated to a few customers 
in  of the company s revenues were derived from sales to ten customers 
one major customer accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated net sales for the year ended december  as a result  any material reduction in sales to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
an act of war or terrorism could disrupt the company s supply of products 
the company purchases its aluminum products exclusively from foreign suppliers 
an act of war or terrorism could disrupt international shipping schedules  cause additional delays in importing the company s products into the united states or increase the costs required to do so 
the company s supply sources are subject to substantial risks 
the company generally purchases aluminum products from foreign suppliers 
thus  its operations could be materially and adversely affected by changes in economic  political and social conditions in the countries where the company currently purchases or may in the future purchase such products 
among other things  changes in laws  regulations  or the interpretation thereof  or restrictions on currency conversions and exports  could negatively affect the company s business 
although the trend in the markets in which the company operates for its sourcing has been towards open markets and trade policies and the fostering of private economic activity  no assurance can be given that the governments will continue to pursue these policies or that such policies may not be significantly altered  especially in the event of a change in the leadership  or as a result of social or political upheaval or unforeseen circumstances affecting economic  political or social life 
consolidation of suppliers may materially affect the company s operations 
during the last several years  consolidations have been taking place among aluminum suppliers 
although the company has in the past successfully replaced any suppliers lost as a result of industry consolidations  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to replace the volume of production or the type of products supplied by any of its current vendors  if they were acquired or their operations terminated or were interrupted 
changing aluminum prices could impact the company s profit margins 
the company relies on long term relationships with its suppliers  but generally has no long term  fixed price purchase contracts  it purchases at prevailing market prices at the time orders are placed  with discounts for quantity purchases 
the aluminum industry is highly cyclical  and the prices that the company pays for aluminum and the prices it charges will be influenced by a variety of factors outside of its control  including general economic conditions both domestic and international  competition  production levels  import duties and other trade restrictions  and currency fluctuations 
while the company hedges metal pricing and foreign currency as it deems appropriate for a portion of its purchase and sales contracts  there exists the risk of a counterparty default in fulfilling the hedge contract 
should there be a counterparty default  the company could be exposed to losses on the original hedged contract 
if suppliers fail to provide products of sufficient quality customer relationships and prices could be negatively affected 
the company s relationships with its customers depend  in part  on its ability to deliver products of the quality specified by those customers 
the company obtains certifications from its suppliers as to the quality of the products being supplied 
however  if the product is not of the quality certified or if a supplier fails to deliver products ordered by the company  the company may be forced to buy product of the specified quality from another source to fulfill the customer s order 
while the company would then be left with a claim against the supplier for any loss sustained by the company  the company may not be able to successfully prosecute these claims  particularly in foreign jurisdictions 
the company is exposed to credit risk from its customers 
the company does not require collateral for customer receivables 
the company has significant balances owing from customers that operate in cyclical industries and under leveraged conditions  which may impair the collectability of these receivables 
the company carries credit insurance with a co pay provision and specific limits on each customer s receivables 
the company s failure to collect a significant portion of the amount due on its receivables directly from customers or through insurance claims or other material default by customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in selected instances the co pay may be increased to 
increased tariffs could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
during  in excess of of sales of the company represented sales of aluminum products from countries that were considered developing countries whose exports were eligible for preferential tariff treatment upon import into the united states under the generalized system of preference gsp 
there can be no assurance that any of our suppliers will continue to be eligible for such preferential tariff treatment or that the generalized system of preference will be renewed after it expires on december  if the preferential tariff treatment of any of our suppliers that are currently eligible for such treatment becomes unavailable  then imports from such supplier may be subjected to a tariff  instead of the duty free treatment those imports now enjoy 
to the extent these increased costs could not be passed on to its customers  the company s profit margins could be negatively affected 
this could result in higher costs to us and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
antidumping and other duties could be imposed on the company  its suppliers and their products 
the imposition of an antidumping or other increased duty on any products imported by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
under united states law  an antidumping duty may be imposed on any imports if two conditions are met 
first  the department of commerce must decide that the imports are being sold in the united states at less than fair value 
second  the international trade commission the itc must determine that the united states industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of the imports 
the itc s determination of injury involves a two prong inquiry first  whether the industry is materially injured  and second  whether the dumping  not other factors  caused the injury 
the itc is required to analyze the volume of imports  the effect of imports on united states prices for like merchandise  and the effects the imports have on united states producers of like products  taking into account many factors  including lost sales  market share  profits  productivity  return on investment  and utilization of production capacity 
if the company fails to deliver products on a timely basis  it may suffer losses 
interruption of shipping schedules upon which the company relies for foreign purchases could result in untimely deliveries to the company s customers or cause the company to purchase the products in the united states at a higher cost in order to meet delivery schedules 
consequently  the company s profit margins could be reduced or it could suffer losses 
the company guarantees its customers that it will deliver products within the period specified in their purchase orders 
any interruption of the means of transportation used by the company to transport products could cause delays in delivery of products  could force the company to buy the products from domestic suppliers at a higher cost in order to fulfill its commitments  and also could result in the loss of customers 
the company competes with companies with captive sources of supply 
many of the company s competitors are significantly larger than the company and many have captive sources of supply and significantly greater access to capital and other resources 
thus  if the company s sources of supply are interrupted  its competitors could be in a position to capture the company s customers 
the company is dependent on its executive officers 
the company is highly dependent on its executive officers  the loss of any of one of which could have a significant adverse impact on the company s business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses financial instruments designated as fair value hedges to manage its exposure to commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk inherent in its trading activities 
it is the company s policy to hedge such risks  to the extent practicable 
the company enters into high grade aluminum futures contracts to limit its gross margin exposure by hedging the metals content element of firmly committed purchase and sales commitments 
in cases where the company enters into fixed price contracts with its supplier and variable priced sales with its customers the company will utilize the futures market to match the terms of the purchase and sale 
the company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its exposure related to commitments to purchase or sell non ferrous metals denominated in international currencies 
in situations where the company enters into purchase or sales denominated in foreign currency the foreign exchange market will be utilized to hedge foreign exchange risk exposure 
the company records mark to market adjustments on these futures and forward positions  and on the underlying firm purchase and sales commitments which they hedge  and reflects the net gains and losses currently in earnings 
at december   net unrealized gains on the company s foreign exchange forward contracts amounted to approximately  as compared to  at december  and net unrealized losses on aluminum futures contracts amounted to approximately  as compared to  in these unrealized amounts were offset by like amounts on the underlying commitments which were hedged  and are reflected in the accompanying and balance sheet in other current assets  inventory  and accrued expenses 
unrealized amounts are reflected on the balance sheet in inventory  and accrued expenses
