item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position as of december  and  and our results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  this discussion should be read with our financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our discussion of our results of operations and financial condition contains statements relating to our future results  including certain projections and trends  which constitute forward looking statements 
certain risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to be materially different from projected results contained in these forward looking statements and other disclosures 
these risks and uncertainties are more fully described under forward looking statements and exposures below 
as used herein  unless otherwise required by the context  the term grant prideco refers to grant prideco  inc and the terms we  our  and similar words refer to grant prideco and its subsidiaries 
the use herein of such terms as group  organization  we  us  our and its  or references to specific entities  are not intended to be a precise description of corporate relationships 
general we are the world s largest manufacturer and supplier of oilfield drill pipe and other drill stem products and one of the leading north american providers of high performance tubular technology and services 
our drill stem products are used to drill oil and gas wells while our premium connections and tubular products are primarily used in drilling and completing oil and gas wells 
our strong market positions  particularly in the premium  technology based end of these products  have allowed us to provide innovative solutions to the drilling and production challenges of our customers in some of the world s harshest environments and most complex well conditions 
we also provide a variety of products and services to the growing worldwide offshore and deepwater market through our marine products and services segment 
these products are used for subsea construction  installation  and production of oil and gas wells 
we historically have operated through three primary business segments drilling products and services  tubular technology and services previously premium connections and tubular products  and marine products and services 
we also are involved in joint ventures to develop and commercialize intelligent drill pipe and composite motors and pumps 
on december   we acquired the reedhycalog tm drill bits business from schlumberger technology corporation and its affiliates for approximately million  consisting of million in cash subject to adjustment  approximately million in grant prideco common stock  and approximately million of assumed non current liabilities 
the addition of reedhycalog tm provides us with a strong market position in the profitable drill bit market as well as a revenue  cash flow  and earnings stream that historically has remained strong throughout the market cycle 
in addition  we expect reedhycalog s strong international presence will reduce our relative exposure to the domestic markets which historically have been more volatile and cyclical when compared to international markets 
until april   we were a wholly owned subsidiary of weatherford international  inc we were spun off from weatherford on april   through a distribution by weatherford to its stockholders of all of our common stock 
as a result of the spinoff  weatherford no longer has an ownership interest in us 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these judgments and assumptions 
for further details relating our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we record revenue at the time our manufacturing process is complete  the customer has been provided with all proper inspection and other required documentation  and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer 
this can include revenue on bill and hold transactions where the product has been completed and is ready to be shipped  however at the customer s request  we are storing the product on the customer s behalf for a brief period of time  typically less than one year 
with respect to reedhycalog tm  for consignment and performance sales  revenue is recognized when the customer runs the bit 
customer advances or deposits are deferred and recognized as revenue when we have completed all of our performance obligations related to the sale 
we also recognize revenue as services are performed 
allowances for bad debts are provided based on a specific customer collection issues 
if actual future allowances differ from what has been identified  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventory costs are determined principally by the use of first in  first out fifo method  and are stated at the lower of such cost or realizable value 
we value our inventories primarily using standard costs  which approximate actual costs  that include raw materials  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead allocations 
we also perform obsolescence reviews on our slow moving drill stem and tubular related inventories and establish reserves based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions  and related management initiatives 
on our drill bits inventory  the inventory obsolescence policy is to reserve of all finished goods inventory over one year old and reserve the remaining net book value of inventory after two years 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
business combinations the cost of business acquisitions is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition using third party appraisals and management judgments 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain 
in addition  estimated liabilities to exit activities of the acquired operations  including the exiting of contractual obligations and the termination of employees  are subject to change as management continues its assessment of operations and finalizes its integration plans 
long lived assets a review for impairment of long lived assets is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if such asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less selling costs 
while we believe no impairment exists at december  under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our financial condition or future results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to annual impairment tests 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of each of our reporting units compared with its carrying value 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit  a second step test is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment 
intangible assets that are not amortized will be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair values of those assets to their carrying values 
other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis over the years expected to be benefited  ranging from to years 
while we believe no impairment exists at december  under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our financial condition or future results of operations 
contingent liabilities we have contingent liabilities and future claims for which we have made estimates of the amount of the actual cost of these liabilities or claims 
these liabilities and claims sometimes involve threatened or actual litigation where damages have been quantified and we have made an assessment of our exposure and recorded a provision to cover an expected loss based on our experience in these matters and  when appropriate  the advice of outside counsel or other outside experts 
upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  our future reported financial results will be impacted by the difference between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle a liability 
examples of areas where we have made important estimates of future liabilities primarily include litigation  warranty claims  and contract claims 
while management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  inherent limitations in the estimation process may cause future actual losses to exceed expected losses 
pension plans the plan obligations and related assets of defined benefit pension plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at december   the actuarial assumption s of the company s domestic plan were discount rate and long term rate of return on plan assets  and for the foreign plan were discount rate  and long term rate of return on plan assets 
market trends and outlook our business is materially dependent on the level of oil and gas drilling activity worldwide  which  in turn  depends on the level of capital spending by major  independent  and state owned exploration and production companies 
this capital spending is driven by current prices for oil and gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices 
all our business segments track the level of the domestic and international rig counts  however their revenues  cash flows  and profitability follow the rig count at different stages within the market cycles 
drill pipe demand is also a function of customer inventory levels and typically lags changes in the worldwide rig count by approximately six months 
results from our tubular technology and services segment should follow changes in north american natural gas rig counts  but short term demand can also be affected by inventories held by oil country tubular goods octg distributors 
demand for our marine products and services should follow the level of offshore and deepwater drilling activity which  although dependent upon prices for oil and gas  is less likely to follow short term changes in oil and gas prices as these projects are more capital intensive and are typically based upon long term forecasts for oil and gas prices 
historically  drill bit demand and reedhycalog s earnings and cash flows have closely tracked the worldwide rig count  which we believe will offset somewhat the cyclicality and mid cycle returns from our drilling products and services segment 
during the three year period ended december   the revenues  profitability  and cash flows from each of our business segments have been significantly impacted by changes in oil and gas prices and rig counts  which were highly volatile during this period 
the following table sets forth certain information with respect to oil and gas prices at the dates indicated and the north american us and canadian and international rig counts for the periods reflected year ended december  wti oil a average ending henry hub gas b average ending north american rig count c average    ending    international rig count c average ending a price per barrel of west texas intermediate wti crude as of the dates presented above

c source baker hughes rig count excludes china and the former soviet union 
in addition  the historical results of operations from each of our business segments have been impacted by internal management initiatives and other changes within grant prideco  including our manufacturing and operational reorganization that began at the beginning of these significant internal changes and initiatives included the following introduction of new products and services 
in  we introduced our proprietary and patented line of extreme tm drilling products  which were specifically designed for harsh and complex drilling conditions such as extended reach  directional  horizontal  deep gas  offshore  and ultra deepwater drilling  as well as high temperature  high pressure  and corrosive well conditions 
we also have improved upon our other premium drill stem product lines designed for challenging drilling environments 
operators and drilling contractors have embraced these product lines as a way to improve their efficiency and ensure performance when drilling under extreme conditions 
unlike more commodity type drill stem products  demand for and sales of these high end premium products are less susceptible to declines in rig counts and have permitted us to maintain higher profitability and cash flow levels during the current reduction in drilling activity when compared to prior periods of reduced activity 
during the year ended december   sales of premium drill stem products represented approximately of our drill stem segment s revenues 
improved pricing discipline 
during the decline in market conditions that occurred in and the first part of  the average prices for our drill stem products eroded  which adversely affected our profitability and cash flow during such periods as well as our ability to regain favorable pricing when market conditions began to improve during and the first half of as a result  during the first quarter of  we implemented strict pricing policies for our drill stem products that significantly increased the prices we received for these products  and we have maintained our pricing policies and discipline during the current downturn in market conditions 
capital improvement program 
at the beginning of  we implemented a capital improvement plan with the objective of reducing costs and improving operating efficiencies 
in connection with this plan  we also reallocated manufacturing facilities to increase our manufacturing absorption rates  increase production volumes  and improve processes to focus on gaining efficiencies 
we currently are in the final stages of installing state of the art pipe handling equipment in our navasota  texas facility and other automated processes throughout our organization 
we believe these initiatives will reduce costs and allow us to more efficiently operate during poor market conditions and ramp up operations when market conditions improve 
in particular  we believe these state of the art improvements have reduced our overall reliance on personnel 
improved manufacturing processes and working capital management strategy 
during  we shifted from a manufacturing mentality focused principally upon maximizing plant utilization to a more efficient business practice focused on producing almost solely for order fulfillment while minimizing costs and working capital requirements 
as a result of these efforts and initiatives to improve working capital policies  procedures and controls  we decreased our working capital  defined as accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable  from million at december  to million  excluding defined working capital related to the reedhycalog tm acquisition of million  at december  future market trends and expectations looking forward at our expected results of operations during  our results will be heavily based upon our customers perceptions regarding the sustainability of oil and natural gas prices 
although  commodity prices have been particularly strong in early  with prices for oil averaging per barrel and north american natural gas prices averaging per mmbtu during february these strong commodity prices have not resulted in significantly increased drilling activity or increased demand for our products and services  particularly in north america 
we believe this unusual trend in demand is the result of numerous factors  including a reduced confidence of oil and gas companies in the sustainability of commodity prices as a result of current us economic conditions and worldwide political instability 
as a result  when planning our operations for  we intend to manage our operations and cost structures based upon an average rig count assumption of  in north america including average us rig count of  and internationally  outside of north america 
utilizing our rig count assumptions  we expect to earn around per share during fiscal before consideration of transition expenses associated with the reedhycalog tm acquisition and costs associated with the shut down of our bryan  texas facility 
all of our forecasts and assumptions are considered forward looking statements  and are subject to numerous risks  and uncertainties  including these highlighted under forward looking statements and exposures

seam mac  in the fourth quarter of  which contributed approximately million of incremental revenues in this increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our industrial product line due to decreased activity levels related to declining fiber optic installation and construction markets 
selling  general  and administrative 
our selling  general  and administrative expenses for our other segment increased as a percentage of revenues from in to in the increase was due primarily to increased marketing efforts in for our industrial product lines partially offset by cost reduction efforts implemented in february operating loss 
our other segment s operating loss increased million  or  in  from an operating loss of million in to an operating loss of million in excluding the effects of other charges  our other segment reported an operating loss of million in as compared to million in the prior year 
this operating loss reflects the decreased activity levels with our industrial product line coupled with inefficiencies associated with the winding down of our operations at our stephenville  texas facility 
also included in our other segment operating loss in is approximately million of costs associated with several new technologies under development 
other items corporate general and administrative 
our corporate general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in the decrease was due primarily to a higher revenue base related to increased oil and gas drilling activity 
interest expense 
our interest expense increased million in due to higher levels of borrowings as compared to in december  we issued million senior notes due  of which a portion of the proceeds was used to pay off our million subordinated note to weatherford 
tax provision benefit 
our effective tax rate in was as compared to in liquidity and capital resources our liquidity depends upon our cash flow from operations  the level of availability under our senior credit facility and our ability to raise capital from third parties 
during the third quarter of  and in anticipation of a declining market during the remainder of and  we instituted a working capital management program focused on reducing our borrowings under credit facilities and increasing our borrowing capacity 
as a result of these efforts  and our financing completed in connection with the reedhycalog tm acquisition  we believe we have significantly improved our liquidity position and that we are well positioned to not only take full advantage of the expected upturn in the market for our products and services  but to maintain our businesses and take advantage of opportunities even in the event of any delay in the expected recovery in our markets 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million  excluding short term debt  and unused borrowing availability of million under our new senior credit facility  as compared to cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million  excluding short term debt  and unused borrowing availability under our previous revolving credit facility of million at december  this million increase in working capital is due to the reedhycalog tm acquisition in december excluding the reedhycalog tm acquisition  which contributed approximately million in working capital as of december   working capital decreased million 
this decrease is primarily due to our efforts to decrease our working capital investment as well as declining market conditions 
the following table summarizes our cash flows provided by used in operating activities  net cash used in investing activities  and net cash provided by used in financing activities for the periods presented year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities    operating activities our net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by million in as compared to this increase reflects the working capital management program we implemented in the fourth quarter of  which focuses on minimizing the cash conversion cycle related to inventory  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
the net incremental source of cash  primarily related to working capital  was million  coupled with increased cash flow of million attributable to dividends from our equity investment in voest alpine 
partially offsetting this increase is a decrease in our net income  before cumulative effect of accounting change  as adjusted for other charges  depreciation  amortization  and deferred income taxes of million 
this decrease reflects the downturn in the oil and gas drilling markets due to the decline in rig counts 
our net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by million in as compared to the improvement in was generated by an increase in our net income as adjusted for other charges  depreciation  amortization  and deferred income taxes of million  coupled with increased cash flow of million attributable to dividends from our equity investment in voest alpine  partially offset by a net incremental use of cash of million related primarily to an increase in working capital 
investing activities our net cash used in investing activities increased by million in as compared to due primarily to increased business acquisitions during coupled with increased capital expenditures for property  plant  and equipment 
in december  we finalized our acquisition of reedhycalog tm  which included approximately million in cash as part of the purchase price 
our net cash used by investing activities decreased by million in as compared to due primarily to decreased business acquisitions activity  partially offset by increased capital expenditures for property  plant  and equipment 
in the fourth quarter of  we consummated four acquisitions for approximately million in cash 
our capital expenditures for property  plant  and equipment totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we currently expect to expend approximately million including expenditures relating to reedhycalog tm for capital expenditures for property  plant  and equipment during this includes capital expenditures related to our capital improvement program to reduce production costs and improve efficiencies and the existing equipment base 
financing activities our net cash provided by financing activities increased by million in as compared to in  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of million senior notes due  coupled with net borrowings of million 
our net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million in as compared to in  we had net borrowings related to our previous credit facility of million as compared to million in in  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of million senior notes due  offset partially by debt repayments of million 
new senior credit facility and other long term debt our debt balances are primarily comprised of borrowings under our new senior credit facility that we entered into contemporaneously with the closing of the reedhycalog tm acquisition and replaced our prior revolving credit facility  our senior notes due  and our senior notes due we estimate our required principal and interest payments for our outstanding debt to be approximately million for new senior credit facility in connection with the reedhycalog tm acquisition  we entered into a new four year million senior secured credit facility senior credit facility with a syndicate of us and foreign banks 
the senior credit facility replaced our prior revolving credit facility 
the senior credit facility is comprised of a million term loan consisting of a million us term loan and a million canadian term loan  and a million revolving credit facility consisting of a million us revolving facility and a million canadian revolving facility 
the credit facilities are guaranteed by grant prideco  inc and all domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our us assets  including us inventories  equipment  receivables  owned real property  and stock of certain foreign subsidiaries 
the canadian credit facilities are guaranteed by grant prideco  inc and all us subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our us assets and certain of our canadian inventories  equipment  receivables  and owned real property and of the stock of certain foreign subsidiaries 
availability under the revolving credit facility  which was million as of december   is based on the collateral value of the inventories and receivables securing the credit facility 
the current outstanding principal balance of the term loans is million 
amounts outstanding under the credit facilities accrue interest at a variable rate based on either the us prime rate plus to depending on our leverage ratio and the type of loan  whether revolving or term or libor plus to depending on our leverage ratio and the type of loan  whether revolving or term for the us denominated advances or a variable rate based on the canadian prime rate plus to depending on our leverage ratio and the type of loan  whether revolving or term or the applicable rate for canadian bankers acceptances  for canadian denominated advances 
interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly or  with respect to libor borrowings  either quarterly or at the end of the applicable libor period 
the us revolving credit facility also provides us with availability for stand by letters of credit 
we are required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants which will limit our ability to incur new debt  make certain investments and acquisitions  sell assets  grant liens  and take other actions 
we are subject to financial covenants that require us to limit our capital expenditures and  under certain circumstances  require us to maintain a certain minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
senior notes due in december  we issued million principal amount of senior notes due net proceeds from the issuance of approximately million were used  along with certain other funds  to fund the cash portion of the reedhycalog tm acquisition 
interest is payable june and december of each year 
after december   we may redeem all or part of the senior notes at any time at a price of of their principal amount plus an applicable premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
the senior notes are guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains various covenants customary in such instruments  including restrictions to incur new debt  pay dividends  sell assets  grant liens  and other related items 
as of december   we were in compliance with the various covenants under the senior notes indenture 
in the event there is a payment default under our credit facility  the senior notes could come due 
senior notes due in december  we issued million principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes were issued at a discount to yield an effective interest rate of 
net proceeds from the issuance of million were utilized to repay a million subordinated note to weatherford international  inc and to repay outstanding borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility of approximately million 
interest is payable june and december of each year 
we may redeem all or part of the senior notes at any time at a price of of their principal amount plus an applicable premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
the senior notes are guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains various covenants customary in such instruments  including restrictions to incur new debt  pay dividends  sell assets  grant liens  and other related items 
as of december   we were in compliance with the various covenants under the senior notes indenture 
in the event there is a payment default under our credit facility  the senior notes could come due 
voest alpine debt 
in connection with the july acquisition of a interest in voest alpine  we incurred debt  denominated in euros  in the amount of million the voest alpine debt 
as of december   this debt had been paid in full 
purchase commitments 
as part of our arrangement to invest in voest alpine  we entered into a four year supply contract with voest alpine commencing july under this agreement  we agreed to purchase a minimum of  metric tons of seamless green drill pipe per year through september at a benchmark third party price 
the volume requirements represent approximately of our normal worldwide requirements for this type of tubular for drill pipe and could be resold by us in the international markets 
because this agreement requires us to purchase tubulars regardless of our needs  some purchases under this agreement could be made for inventory during periods of low demand 
these types of purchases would require us to use our working capital and expose us to risks of excess inventory during those periods 
although these purchases could require us to expend a material amount of money  we expect that we will be able to use or sell all of the tubular products we are required to purchase from voest alpine 
we are in the process of extending the term of this contract  which we would expect to have similar terms and conditions as our existing contractual arrangement 
liquidity outlook we estimate our required principal and interest payments for our outstanding debt to be approximately million for and capital expenditures for to be approximately million in the aggregate 
this includes expenditures related to our capital improvement program we began in we currently expect to satisfy all required capital expenditures and debt service requirements during from operating cash flows  existing cash balances  and the revolver of our new senior credit facility 
as of december   we had borrowed million under the senior credit facility  of which million relates to the term loan and million had been used to support outstanding letters of credit 
net borrowing availability was million 
based on our current projected capital expenditures and required principal and interest payments  our operating cash flows  existing cash balances  and estimated availability under the new senior credit facility  we believe we can satisfy all of our expected commitments during the next months and will have sufficient liquidity in the event of a prolonged market downturn to not only maintain our existing operations but to take advantage of strategic opportunities that may present themselves during any such period 
acquisitions and expansions will be financed from cash flow from operations  borrowings under our new senior credit facility  or through a combination of the issuance of additional equity and debt financing  as appropriate 
any future financing will be arranged to meet our requirements  with the timing  amount  and form of issue dependent on the prevailing market and general economic conditions 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt      capital lease obligations    operating leases      purchase commitments open ended    closed ended total contractual obligations      commercial commitments total less than year years years after years line of credit standby letters of credit   total commercial commitments   tax matters as a result of our spinoff from weatherford  subsequent to april   we are no longer able to combine the results of our operations with those of weatherford in reporting income for united states federal income tax purposes and for income tax purposes in states and foreign countries in which we do business 
under the terms of a tax allocation agreement with weatherford  we will not have the future benefit of any prior tax losses or benefits incurred as part of a consolidated return with weatherford 
moreover  we will be liable to weatherford for any corporate level taxes incurred by weatherford as a result of the spinoff  except to the extent the taxes arise solely as a result of a change of control of weatherford 
we believe these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
related party transactions a majority of our current board of directors appointed at the time of our spinoff are also directors of weatherford 
in addition  in connection with our spinoff from weatherford in april  we entered into a preferred supplier agreement with weatherford for a period of up to three years that provided a million drill stem purchase price credit as partial payment of intercompany debt being forgiven by them at the time of the spinoff 
weatherford has utilized approximately million of the drill stem credit as of december  we are currently in negotiations with weatherford to extend the terms of this agreement 
prior to and since the spinoff  weatherford has remained a customer for our drill stem and other products 
we believe that the prices we charge weatherford for these products under our preferred supplier agreement are arms length prices and consistent with market prices charged to similarly situated rental tool companies 
our transactions with weatherford are more fully described in note to our financial statements 
off balance sheet financing as of december  we own interests in three companies that are not consolidated in our financial statements  including voest alpine 
such investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements for financial data  including total assets and liabilities for voest alpine 
the two other joint ventures relate to technologies we are currently developing 
these two companies do not have any debt  other than trade payables relating primarily to research and development expenses 
we do not have any off balance sheet hedging  financing arrangements  contracts  or operations that rely upon credit or similar ratings 
recent accounting pronouncements for recent accounting pronouncements  see note in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
forward looking statements and exposures in light of the sec s regulation fd  we have elected to provide in this report various forward looking statements and operational details 
we have done so to assure full market disclosure of information that we generally make available to our investors and securities analysts 
we expect to provide updates to this information on a regular basis in our periodic and current reports filed with the sec 
we have also made our investor conference calls open to all investors and encourage all investors to listen in on these calls 
we will publicly announce the call in information in a press release before such calls 
we are providing this information to assist our stockholders in better understanding our business 
these expectations reflect only our current view on these matters as of the date of this report and are subject to change based on changes of facts and circumstances 
there can be no assurance that these expectations will be met and our actual results will likely vary up or down from those currently projected 
these estimates speak only of our expectations as of the date of this report and we make no undertaking to update this information 
the absence of an update should not be considered as an affirmation of our current expectations or that facts have not changed during the quarter that would impact our expectations 
in modeling our earnings for  we have made numerous assumptions regarding our operations 
although we believe  as of the date this report is filed  that these assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that they will be correct in the future 
general the average north american rig count us and canada for will be the average international rig count for will be natural gas prices will not fall in a manner that would affect demand for our products or potential purchasing decisions or customer perceptions 
domestic demand for our drill stem products will increase during the year and result in increased sales during the second half of international demand for our drill stem products will continue to be relatively strong throughout we expect our effective tax rate to be to during there will be no changes in domestic or worldwide political events that would have an adverse consequence upon the domestic or worldwide economies and the demand for our products and services 
in particular  we assume that opec and other oil exporting countries and organizations will take reasonable actions to insure that worldwide oil prices remain relatively stable and not fall for any prolonged period of time that would adversely affect demand for our products  and that united states current and potential military actions in afghanistan  iraq  or elsewhere will not disrupt any of our operations or demand for our products 
we will expend approximately of revenues on research and development activities during we will expend approximately million on capital expenditures during we will reduce our consolidated debt by approximately million during we will not experience any material unusual losses  expenses  or charges associated with litigation  warranty claims  environmental matters  or property losses 
our marine connection product lines will not be materially affected by the impact of the watts litigation described in item legal proceedings 
our utility costs  labor costs  and other expenses will not increase substantially from their current levels 
our manufacturing operations will not experience any material disruptions in supply or efficiencies 
we will not incur any material currency remeasurement or transactional losses or other foreign currency losses 
there will not be any material acquisitions or divestments during the year 
although we have made this assumption for modeling purposes  we do expect that some acquisitions and divestments will be made during the year that will affect our projections and assumptions 
there will be no material adverse affect on our operations as a result of united states trade laws during our operations and costs will not be adversely affected by any other actions under the trade laws relating to products imported by us from our foreign locations 
risk factors and exposures our company and the businesses in which it operates are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could have adverse consequences on our results of operations and financial condition and that could cause actual results to be materially different from projected results contained in the forward looking statements in this report and in our other disclosures 
investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties when evaluating our company and the forward looking statements that we make 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following a further decline in domestic and worldwide oil and gas drilling activity would adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is materially dependent on the level of oil and gas drilling activity in north america and worldwide  which in turn depends on the level of capital spending by major  independent and state owned exploration and production companies 
this capital spending is driven by current prices for oil and gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices 
oil and gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuation in recent years in response to changes in the supply and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty  world events  governmental actions  and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  including the level of north american and worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity  worldwide economic conditions  particularly economic conditions in north america  oil and gas production costs  the expected costs of developing new reserves  national government political requirements and the policies of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec  the price and availability of alternative fuels  environmental regulation  and tax policies 
decreased demand for our products results not only from periods of lower drilling activity  but also from the resulting build up of customer inventory of drill pipe associated with idle rigs  which can be used on active rigs in lieu of new purchases 
the time period during which drill pipe inventory is used is a function of the number of rigs actively drilling and the expected level of drilling activity 
a decrease in the number of rigs actively drilling results in a large amount of unused drill pipe on idle rigs and a decrease in demand for new drill pipe 
in general  customers begin placing orders for new drill pipe when expected rig utilization over the next two quarters approaches the number of rigs for which customers have available drill pipe 
an economic downturn could adversely affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations 
the us and worldwide economies slowed during the decline in the us economy has negatively impacted natural gas drilling activity 
if expected economic improvement in the us does not occur or international markets decline unexpectedly  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
increases in the prices of our raw materials could affect our results of operations 
we use large amounts of steel tubulars and bars in the manufacture of our products 
the price of these raw materials has a significant impact on our cost of producing products 
if we are unable to pass future raw material price increases on to our customers  our margins and results of operations could be adversely affected 
due to intense competition in our industry  our revenues may decline if we do not develop  produce  and commercialize new competitive technologies and products or if we are unable to adequately protect our current and future intellectual property rights relating to our technologies and products 
the markets for our premium products and services are characterized by continual developments 
substantial improvements in the scope and quality of product function and performance can occur over a short period of time 
in order to remain competitive  we must be able to develop commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology 
our ability to develop new products and maintain competitive advantages depends on our ability to design and commercially market products that meet the needs of our customers  including delivery schedules and product specifications 
additionally  the time and expense invested in product development may not result in commercially feasible applications that provide revenues 
we could be required to write off our entire investment in a new product that does not reach commercial viability 
moreover  we may experience operating losses after new products are introduced and commercialized because of high start up costs  unexpected manufacturing costs or problems  or lack of demand 
many of our products and the processes we use to manufacture them have been granted us and international patent protection  or have patent applications pending 
nevertheless  patents may not be granted for our applications and  if patents are issued  the claims allowed may not be sufficient to protect our technology 
if our patents are not enforceable or if any of our products infringe patents held by others  our financial results may be adversely affected 
our competitors may be able to independently develop technology that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents  which is especially true internationally where the protection of intellectual property rights may not be as effective 
in addition  obtaining and maintaining intellectual property protection internationally may be significantly more expensive than doing so domestically 
we may have to spend substantial time and money defending our patents and  after our patents expire  our competitors will not be legally constrained from developing products substantially similar to ours 
our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon our ability to successfully increase and decrease  without material disruption  our manufacturing capacity and expense in response to changes in demand and to maintain prices for our products  which can be adversely affected by changes in industry conditions and competitive forces 
our projections assume a steady increase in demand for our products and services during  in particular our drill stem products 
in order to meet our projections  we assume we will increase our production during peak demand periods with minimal operational disruption and inefficiency 
if this does not happen  our results of operations during ramp up for high demand periods could be materially adversely affected 
beginning in  we initiated substantial price increases for our drill stem products  which began benefiting revenues and operating profit during the third quarter of our ability to maintain these price increases is subject to various risks  including adverse changes in industry conditions  as well as unexpected actions by our competitors 
we believe our current prices are generally at satisfactory levels given the increased quality and premium nature of our products  but if market conditions or other factors cause us to decrease prices  our results could be materially adversely affected 
our international operations may experience severe interruptions due to political  economic  or other risks  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
during  we derived approximately of our total revenues from our facilities outside the us in addition  a large part of sales from our domestic locations were for use in foreign countries 
we expect this percentage to increase substantially  and our recent acquisition of reedhycalog tm will further increase our international exposure 
in addition  many of our key manufacturing operations are outside of the us our operations in certain international locations  including mexico  austria  italy  china  indonesia  united kingdom  and singapore are subject to various political and economic conditions existing in those countries that could disrupt operations 
these risks include changes in foreign tax laws  changes in regulations and labor practices  currency fluctuations and devaluations  currency restrictions and limitations on repatriation of profits  and political instability or military conflict 
our foreign operations may suffer disruptions  and we may incur losses that will not be covered by insurance 
we have not historically carried political risk insurance 
in particular  terrorist attacks and other threats to us national security and resulting us military activity throughout the world increases the possibility that our operations could be interrupted or adversely affected 
such disruption could result in our inability to ship products in a timely and cost effective manner or our inability to place contractors and employees in various countries or regions 
any material currency fluctuations or devaluations or political events that disrupt oil and gas exploration and production or the movement of funds and assets could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
we have entered into an agreement with voest alpine  an entity of which we own  to purchase  metric tons of green tubulars per year through september our future results could be adversely affected if we are unable to use or resell these tubulars 
in addition  we have agreed to be responsible for paying any anti dumping duties in the us on the resale of these tubulars  which could affect our ability to resell the tubulars in the us further  our long term supply contract with voest alpine is denominated in euros 
we have no significant offset for revenues in euros and we have not hedged for currency risk with respect to this contract 
in addition  our manufacturing of tool joints in italy has benefited from a weak euro against the us dollar until recently 
thus  a material long term strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
if we are unable to adequately renew or replace our supply contract with voest alpine and our processing agreement with us steel  our results of operations and financial results would be adversely affected 
our four year supply contract with voest alpine  under which we have agreed to purchase a minimum of  metric tons of tubulars per year  expires in september the volume requirements represent approximately one half of our normal worldwide requirements for this type of tubulars during normalized market conditions 
if we are unable to successfully renew or replace this supply contract on terms reasonably acceptable to us  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
similarly  we have entered into a contract with us steel to provide processing services for virtually all of its large diameter casing products 
this contract expires on december   and we do not expect that it will be renewed 
during  this contract contributed approximately million in revenues and earnings per share of approximately 
if we are unable to adequately replace this business with comparable quantities and sales margins  our results of operations and financial results could be adversely affected 
in connection with our business operations and the reedhycalog tm acquisition  we could be subject to substantial liability claims that adversely affect our results of operations 
we have assumed a substantial portion of reedhycalog s obligations  responsibilities  liabilities  costs  and expenses arising out of or incurred in connection with its business 
our products  as well as reedhycalog s drill bits and related technologies  are complex  and the failure of this equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers costs of drilling a well 
in addition  many of these products are used in hazardous drilling and production applications where an accident or product failure can cause personal injury or loss of life  damage to property  equipment  or the environment  regulatory investigations and penalties  and the suspension of the end user s operations 
if our products or services fail to meet specifications or are involved in accidents or failures  we could face warranty  contract  or other litigation claims for which we may be held responsible and our reputation for providing quality products may suffer 
our insurance may not be adequate in risk coverage or policy limits to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur or be responsible for under the reedhycalog tm purchase agreement 
moreover  in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate or at premiums that are reasonable for us  particularly in the recent environment of significant insurance premium increases 
further  any claims made under our policies will likely cause our premiums to increase 
any future damages deemed to be caused by our products or services  including those of reedhycalog tm  that are assessed against us and that are not covered by insurance  or that are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations that expose us to potential financial liability 
our operations are regulated under a number of federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations  which govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water  as well as the handling  storage  and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of contaminated sites 
compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration in the manufacturing of our products 
because we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our manufacturing operations  we may be subject to material financial liability for any investigation and clean up of such hazardous materials  and any related personal injury damages or toxic tort claims 
we have not historically carried insurance for such matters 
in addition  many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes 
accordingly  we also may be subject to financial liabilities relating to the investigation and remediation of hazardous materials resulting from the action of previous owners or operators of industrial facilities on those sites 
liability in many instances may be imposed on us regardless of the legality of the original actions relating to the hazardous or toxic substances or whether or not we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of those substances 
liabilities we have assumed in connection with the reedhycalog tm acquisition include  subject to certain exceptions  certain obligations  liabilities  costs  and expenses for violations of health  safety and environmental laws relating to the assets and include certain unknown  as well as known  obligations  liabilities  costs  and expenses arising or incurred prior to  on or after the closing date 
furthermore  with certain exceptions  we may be required to indemnify schlumberger against losses incurred in connection with or related to these assumed liabilities 
we are also subject to various federal  state  local  and foreign laws and regulations relating to safety and health conditions in our manufacturing facilities 
those laws and regulations may subject us to material financial penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance  as well as potential business disruption if any of our facilities or a portion of any facility is required to be temporarily closed as a result of any violation of those laws and regulations 
any such financial liability or business disruption could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are unfamiliar with the drill bits business and may face unexpected difficulties in operating the business or may not achieve the expected benefits of the reedhycalog tm acquisition 
prior to the reedhycalog tm acquisition  we did not own or operate drill bits businesses 
the reedhycalog tm acquisition has resulted in a new drill bits product line for us 
our overall management team has limited experience in drill bits development  manufacturing  and distribution operations  so we may face regulatory and operational matters with which we are unfamiliar 
in addition  we may be operating in unfamiliar markets and be less able to respond to changes in markets than our more experienced competitors 
therefore  until the reedhycalog tm assets  product lines  and operations have been transitioned into our operations  it is difficult to predict accurately the effects of the reedhycalog tm acquisition 
furthermore  synergies and other benefits we expect to result from the acquisition of reedhycalog tm may not be achieved or  if achieved  may not be achieved in the period in which they are expected 
in addition  whether we will actually realize anticipated benefits depends on future events and circumstances beyond our control  such as economic conditions in general or in the oil and gas industry in particular  and the other risk factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
we may not have the same competitive advantages in the drill bits business as we enjoy in the competitive environment for the manufacture  supply  and provision of oilfield drill pipe and other drill stem products and premium connections and tubular products 
we hold a leading market position and have greater resources than many of our competitors in the business of manufacturing  supplying  and providing oilfield drill pipe and other drill stem products and premium connections and tubular products 
the competitive environment for the drill bits business differs greatly  with smith international  baker hughes  reedhycalog tm  and halliburton being the largest competitors 
each of smith international  baker hughes  and halliburton has greater marketing  financial  and technical resources than we do and could use those resources to affect our ability to compete  thereby reducing the sales  profits  and benefits we expect to receive from the reedhycalog tm acquisition 
assimilating reedhycalog tm into our corporate structure may strain our resources and may prove to be difficult 
the reedhycalog tm acquisition was significantly larger than any of our previous acquisitions 
the significant expansion of our business and operations  both in terms of geography and magnitude  resulting from the acquisition of reedhycalog tm may strain our administrative  operational  and financial resources 
in addition  the reedhycalog tm acquisition included the drill bit assets  but did not include all of the corporate infrastructure necessary to operate such business 
the creation of corporate and administrative infrastructure for reedhycalog tm and the assimilation of reedhycalog tm into our company will require substantial time  effort  attention  and dedication of management resources and may detract our management in unpredictable ways from our traditional business 
the transition process could create a number of potential challenges and adverse consequences for us  including the possible unexpected loss of key employees  customers or suppliers  a possible loss of revenues or an increase in operating or other costs 
these types of challenges and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may not be able to manage the combined operations and assets effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of reedhycalog tm 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to pursue other strategic acquisitions and we may face similar challenges regarding such acquisitions 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by actions under us trade laws and new foreign entrants into us markets 
although we are a us based manufacturing company  we do own and operate international manufacturing operations that support our us based business 
if actions under us trade laws were instituted that limited our access to these products  our ability to meet our customer specifications and delivery requirements would be reduced 
any adverse effects on our ability to import products from our foreign subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
additionally  foreign producers of tubular goods have been found to have sold their products  which may include premium connections  for export to the us at prices that are lower than the cost of production  or their prices in their home market  or a major third country market 
anti dumping orders restricting the manner and price at which tubular goods from certain countries can be imported are currently in effect 
if such orders are revoked or changed  we could be exposed to increased competition from imports that could reduce our sales and market share 
in addition  the premium connections market served by our atlas bradford r product line is highly competitive 
the level of competition could further increase if foreign steel mills  with their own lines of internationally accepted premium connections  more successfully penetrate the us market 
our results of operations could be adversely affected due to an implementation of a new enterprise wide resource planning erp system 
we currently are implementing a new management erp system that we believe will  in the long term  significantly enhance our information systems  internal processes and controls 
this implementation is ongoing and includes a significant amount of management s time and dedication and may distract management in unpredictable ways from our core businesses 
additionally  the erp system might not result in the anticipated benefits and may actually cause disruptions and inefficiencies in our businesses which could result in increases in our operating and other costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments we are currently exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that we enter into in the normal course of business 
these risks relate to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we do not believe these risks are material 
refer to note to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional information on financial instruments 
foreign currency risk the functional currency for a majority of our international operations is the applicable local currency 
results of operations for foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar are translated using average exchange rates during the period 
assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  and the resulting translation adjustments are included in stockholders equity 
however  foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in income for the period 
we sometimes hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts 
forward contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency transactions are marked to the forward rate with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings  offsetting losses and gains on the transactions hedged 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts only as a hedge against existing economic exposures and not for speculative or trading purposes 
the counterparties to our foreign exchange contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks 
we believe that the risk of counterparty nonperformance is minimal 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
at december   we had no open forward contracts 
at december   we had open forward contracts and call options to exchange us dollars for euros at a fair value of approximately million 
for the year ended december   we have recognized hedging losses of million 
interest rates we are and will be subject to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our long term debt 
the following tables summarize our debt obligations at december  and  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the tables present principal cash flows by expected maturity dates and weighted average interest rates in thousands long term debt thereafter fixed rate     average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate long term debt thereafter fixed rate     average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate excluding the senior notes  most of our long term borrowings are at variable rates  which reflect current market rates  and therefore the fair value of these borrowings approximates book value 
based upon these balances  an immediate change of one percent in the interest rate would not cause a material change in interest expense on an annual basis 
the fair value of financial instruments which differed from their carrying value at december  and  was as follows in millions december  carrying fair carrying fair value value value value senior notes due senior notes due currently  we have variable interest rate debt totaling approximately million 
these variable rate debts expose us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short term interest rates 
if the variable interest rate were to increase by from december levels  our combined interest expense would increase by approximately million annually 
the carrying value of our variable interest rate debt approximates fair value as they bear interest at current market rates
