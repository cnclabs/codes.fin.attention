item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
results of operations for purposes of financial reporting  the company operates in two industry segments the fuller brands segment  which is involved in developing  manufacturing  distributing  and marketing branded consumer and commercial cleaning and personal care products in north america and internationally  and the cpac imaging imaging segment  which includes the company s color photographic  health care  and graphic arts imaging operations in the united states  belgium  italy  south africa  and thailand 
the products of each segment are manufactured and marketed both in the us and in other parts of the world 
sales between segments are not material 
net sales and net income the company s sales decreased in  as compared to  and in as compared to for the fuller brands segment in  net sales decreased over the slowing of the stanley home products division s business  whose net sales were down  contributed to the decrease  as did cleaning technologies group ctg  whose net sales  despite operating in a difficult  price competitive environment  decreased only 
ctg continued to be impacted as a result of lower kmart business due to additional kmart store closings 
the fuller brush division s net sales were up largely due to the successful program initiated with the qvc television home shopping business  which provided the division with a new sales distribution outlet 
in  the fuller brands segment net sales decreased over this was primarily due to the decrease in cleaning technologies group sales of almost  due to the effects of the september  terrorist attacks and the reduction in kmart business 
in  stanley home products slight sales decreases were offset by sales increases in the traditional fuller brush business 
for the imaging segment in  net sales decreased over the decrease was partially caused by a decrease in net sales in the company s domestic medical imaging business 
this part of the imaging business continues to be impacted by the presence of digital imaging  as well as continued competition within its distribution network 
while the company s domestic photochemical imaging business net sales were down less than  this business continues to be impacted by the slowdown in picture taking in the us  as well as price competition 
the segment s net sales performance was favorably impacted by the growth in its foreign imaging businesses see foreign operations section 
in  net sales for the imaging segment decreased over this decrease was largely the result of sales decreases in the segment s domestic photochemical  medical imaging  and equipment manufacturing operations  mitigated by combined sales increases in the segment s international operati ons 
the company s domestic operations in continued to be impacted by the competition in the north american market  as well as the business slowdown experienced  as a result of the us recession  and september  terrorist attacks 
the company s income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended march   decreased as compared to the proforma net income for of  the proforma net income for represents net income as if the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
had been applied in the prior year 
sales declines  the continuation of investments in sales and marketing programs  and the rebuilding of management teams in both segments to position the company when economic recovery begins  contributed to this decline 
proforma net income in decreased over the proforma net income of  in  as both segments profits declined 
in the fuller brands segment  stanley home products and cleaning technologies group operations had sharp declines in profits  due to sales shortfalls outlined above  as well as continued investment in sales and marketing programs to stimulate the business 
the traditional fuller brush busine ss helped to mitigate this decline with strong earnings from their contract consumer and catalog internet business 
in the imaging segment  all business profits declined  with the exception of the segment s asian operations  led by its north american photochemical operation 
the company adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of and recorded a one time  non cash expense of  net of a tax benefit of  or per diluted share 
the adjustment related to the fuller brands segment s cleaning technologies group ctg investment in fiscal  whose goodwill was determined to be impaired  based on calculating the present value of future cash flows 
ctg had been impacted by several factors  including continued  reduced operating performance 
see footnote in the consolidated financial statements 
the net loss after the cumulative effect adjustment was  or a diluted share 
foreign operations combined net sales of the company s foreign operations in belgium  italy  south africa  and thailand  after converting from local currencies to us dollars  rose approximately  or in over the increase was primarily attributable to cpac europe and cpac asia  whose sales increased on a us dollar basis  and  respectively and on a local currency basis  respectively 
cpac europe s increase was largely as a result of increased photochemical paper sales  due in part to the company s relationship with tura ag  which has provided new sales opportunities 
as disclosed elsewhere  cpac in acquired a share ownership in this german distributor  and subsequent to march   increased its investment to 
cpac asia s increase in over continues the growth exhibited in the asian marketplace 
increases in gross us dollars  after the impact of currency translation to a us dollar basis  for cpac italia and africa were r elatively minor 
combined net sales of the company s foreign operations in belgium  italy  south africa  and thailand increased  or in over this was primarily due to cpac asia whose net sales increased  over levels 
combined net sales of cpac europe  italia  and africa decreased  where currency declines against the us dollar impacted their translated results 
combined pretax profits for the company s foreign operations in  after converting from local currencies to us dollars  declined approximately  or over expenses related to accounts receivable collection problems with distributor receivables at both cpac asia and cpac europe  resulted in an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts in of approximately  net of minority interest 
cpac asia s difficulties  disclosed in the second and third quarterly q filings  resulted from a japanese distributor  whereas cpac europe s difficulties resulted in an increase to its allowance for doubtful accounts in the fourth quarter of approximately  primarily due to problems in russia 
cpac italia s start up expenses in the first quarter  amounting to approximately  relating to its move to a new manufacturing facility also impacted the year to date results 
however  cpac africa s results for helped mitigate the decline  as it experienced an approximate  increase in pretax profit  net of minority interest  its best performance since being acquired in in  pretax profits for the four combined entities declined almost due to currency pressures in italy and south africa  as well as continued investment in sales and marketing initiatives to attempt to maintain or increase revenues 
the company has exposure to currency fluctuations and occasionally has utilized hedging programs primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts to help minimize the impact of these fluctuations on results of operations 
at march  no forward foreign currency exchange contracts were outstanding 
the company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 
on a consolidated basis  foreign currency exchange losses are included in income or expense as incurred and are not material to the results of operations 
gross margins gross margins net sales less cost of sales expressed as a percentage of net sales were   and for the years ended march    and  respectively 
gross margins in the fuller brands segment increased to in  from and in and  respectively 
improvements reflected the impact of the television home shopping business  which has higher gross margins accompanied by higher selling and marketing costs  coupled with less volume of ctg s competitively priced national accounts business 
the increase in as compared to was a result of product mix sold 
gross margins in will continue to be under pressure  if the stanley home products and ctg sales declines continue  due to unabsorbed overhead problems that would be encountered in the segment s great bend  kansas  manufacturing facility 
numerous sales initiatives to place volume through the facility  as well as cost control programs  are being implemented to continue to guard against margin erosion 
competitive bidding situations for gaining or maintaining business in all divisions  however  will make this a challenging situation for gross margins in the imaging segment were in  as compared to and in and  respectively 
lower margins at the company s domestic photochemical imaging operation due to continued  reduced volume see imaging restructuring disclosure for further description  coupled with slightly lower margins experienced by the company s foreign locations  due to pricing pressures encountered during the worldwide economic slowdown  contributed to the versus decline 
the increase in versus was a result of strong margin improvement in several of the foreign operations in the early part of the fiscal year  although the worldwide economic slowdown prevented this improvement from being sustained 
the company is hopeful that the imaging restructuring plan to be implemented during will help to reduce redundant costs from domestic underutilized facilities and  coupled with continued strong growth in asia  will help to maintain gross margins at present lev els 
selling  administration and engineering expenses these expenses amounted to   and of net sales in   and  respectively 
in the fuller brands segment  selling  administrative  and engineering expenses were versus and in and  respectively 
the increase in versus is partially a result of the increased sales through the television home shopping distribution channel  which has higher sales and marketing costs 
in the increase over levels was a direct result of lower revenues  coupled with increased marketing and promotional expenses  in the segment s stanley home products to increase its direct selling business 
in the imaging segment  selling  administrative  and engineering expenses were versus and in and  respectively 
the increase in over was partially a result of increasing foreign accounts receivable reserves  as well as flat expenses on decreasing revenues  in the segment s domestic medical imaging operation 
as described in the imaging restructuring disclosure  the company is attempting to reduce duplicate operating costs  as a result of declining revenues in its domestic imaging operations and believes upon completion of the project  selling  administration and engineering expenses domestically  as a percentage of net sales  will be lower 
the increase in over was largely caused by the continued decline in sales in the third and fourth quarter of  without a corresponding reduction in spending 
research and development expenses research and development expenses  as a percentage of sales have remained relatively consistent at approximately of net sales for and for and  respectively 
the level of expense reflects the company s emphasis of focusing on improving existing products or developing complimentary products  based on customer needs 
for the fuller brands segment s focus will be on continuing to develop new products to enhance its growing television shopping business  stimulate recruitment efforts in its direct selling business  as well as continuing to enhance ctg s commercial cleaning product offerings to compete in the highly competitive janitorial sanitation business 
in the imaging segment  continued effort will be placed on developing easy to use prepackaged  chemical formulations and continuing to develop innovative wrap around programs  involving chemistry  paper  and equipment for use in domestic and overseas imaging markets 
these efforts are not expected to increase research and development expenses  as a percentage of sales  significantly from prior periods 
interest expense net interest expense interest expense less interest income declined in versus  largely as a result of net debt reduction at the company s foreign operations and continued lower debt interest rates both domestically and overseas 
while cash and equivalents increased in versus  lower interest rates on invested cash caused interest income to decline 
net interest expense declined in versus caused by a combination of lower interest rates and debt reduction in the decline in interest income was less severe due to a strong cash balance early in  offsetting declining interest rates 
income taxes the provision for income taxes on income before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was in  as compared to and in and  respectively 
the continued reduction in the company s effective tax rate in resulted from a lower provision from its italian operation  who received certain tax credits and benefits related to its facility relocation  as well as the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards at its african operation 
similar to  the effective rate shows the benefits of the seven year tax holiday existing for the company s asian subsidiary  as well as lower state taxes due to reduced domestic earnings 
since the company continues to receive the tax holiday into fiscal  cpac asia will continue to significantly impact the future effective rate  depending on its profitability 
although it is expected that the italian operation s effective rate may increase in and state taxes may rise as domestic earnings increase  the company should continue to experience tax benefits in africa  which may help to mitigate the increase in the effective rate 
in conjunction with the sfas no 
goodwill adjustment recognized by the company in the first quarter of amounting to  a tax benefit of  was recorded 
this deferred asset is expected to be realized over the next nine years  as the goodwill is deducted for income tax purposes 
imaging restructuring on may  the company announced that it was consolidating its domestic manufacturing of imaging chemicals into its norcross  georgia  facility and that it would be curtailing manufacturing at its st 
louis  missouri  facility sometime during the second quarter of the fiscal year ending march  the physical move of manufacturing and related equipment is expected to begin in the second quarter and complete consolidation is expected early in the company s fourth quarter 
the majority of the employees at its st 
louis facility will be given severance packages upon curtailment of operations 
severance and costs of relocating the manufacturing operation are estimated to total approximately  net of tax a diluted share and will be recognized in liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations and acquisitions with internally generated cash flows  supplemented with outside borrowings

consolidated net cash used in investing activities increased in over  primarily due to the company s initial investment of  in tura ag 
net cash provided by used in financing activities consolidated net cash used in financing activities decreased in over one of the contributors to the decrease was the reduction in common stock shares repurchased during the year  and reduced debt paydowns as a result of lower debt levels in in consolidated net cash used in financing activities decreased versus  due to lower debt reduction payments  lower dividends due to less shares outstanding  offset by increased stock repurchases  versus the prior year 
working capital ratios working capital is the excess of current assets over current liabilities 
the working capital ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities 
for the years ended march  working capital in thousands working capital ratio to to to in the company continued to build working capital  despite lower sales and profits  due to tight cash controls  aggressive receivable collections  implementation of inventory reduction goals within the fuller brands segment  and reduction in working capital borrowings at cpac asia  as a result of continued strong cash flow 
during fiscal  despite the shortfall in sales and profits  the company s fuller brands segment continued to provide positive cash flow  allowing the consolidated company to continue its stock repurchase programs  acquire capital assets where needed  and fund the imaging segment s investment in tura ag 
during fiscal  reductions in capital spending million and reductions in stock repurchases million helped to offset lower earnings million and contributed to increased working capital and an improvement in the working capital ratio 
during june  the company renewed its existing line of credit agreement agreement  with a new two year agreement  maturing on october  the agreement continues the maximum borrowing capability of  with interest at libor plus to  based on funded debt to ebita parameters 
it also requires meeting various financial covenants with which the company was in compliance at march  the agreement also contains a million letter of credit facility  which the company uses to collateralize the fuller brands industrial revenue bonds 
the company s majority owned subsidiary cpac asia imaging products limited has a line of credit with an international bank of million baht approximately  based on the year end conversion rate in thailand 
interest is payable at the bank s announced prime rate in thailand  which was at march   with the line collateralized by a standby letter of credit loc guaranteed by cpac  inc cpac asia imaging products limited had borrowings against the line of credit of  at march  management believes that its existing available lines of credit and cash flows from operations should be adequate to meet normal working capital needs  based on operations as of march  it is expected that additional financing may be necessary to allow the company to pursue additional acquisitions

net income to net worth is calculated by dividing net income by the amount of ending shareholders equity 
for the years ended march  operating return on net sales net income loss on net sales net income to net worth the decrease in operating return on net sales in as compared to  is largely a function of the imaging segment s reduced sales with flat operating costs  higher unallocated corporate overhead  mitigated by an improvement in the fuller brands segment operating income led by its entr e into the television home shopping business 
the negative return on net income loss on net sales and net income loss to net worth for is a function of the million cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle charge taken upon adoption of sfas no 
in the company s first quarter 
the decrease in operating return on net sales  net income on net sales  and net income to net worth in  as compared to  is a result of the reduction in sales and earnings in both the fuller brands and imaging segments 
leverage ratios debt to debt plus equity is calculated by dividing all liabilities by the sum of all liabilities plus shareholders equity 
total debt to equity is calculated by dividing all liabilities by the amount of shareholders equity 
these ratios measure the extent to which the company has been financed by debt and are an important measure to our lending institutions 
for the years ended march  debt to debt plus equity total debt to equity to to to in debt to debt plus equity and debt to equity remained relatively constant versus  despite the net loss incurred by the company  as a result of the sfas no 
adoption and related adjustment of million  net of tax

critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
cpac  inc believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve additional management judgement due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset  liability  revenue  and expense amounts 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned  based on terms of sale with the customer 
this occurs primarily when the product has been shipped and legal title and all risks of ownership have been transferred  sales price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the terms and arrangements vary by product categories  owing to the different nature of the customers  distribution channels  and products 
the company records estimated reductions to revenues for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts  volume discounts  rebates  and specifically established customer product return programs 
if market conditions were to change  the company may take actions to expand these customer offerings  which may result in incremental reductions to revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company regularly reviews its customer accounts and records specific provisions for doubtful accounts to reduce the related receivable to the amount that is estimated to be collectible 
the company also records provisions for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the company s historical experience  current economic conditions  and other adverse industry or market trends 
if circumstances related to specific customers were to change  the company s estimates with respect to the collectibility of the related receivables could be further adjusted 
the company considers all available information in its quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts 
the company recorded an expense provision of   and  to the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended march    and  respectively 
inventory reserves the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
as part of this valuation  reserve provisions are made to reduce inventory carrying values based on estimates of what is excess  slow moving  or obsolete  or for inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these provisions are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions  and related management initiatives 
if in the future  the company determines that market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected  and  therefore  inventory is overvalued  the company will be required to further reduce the carrying value of the inventory and record an expense at the time the determination is made 
the company recorded an expense provision of   and  for excess  slow moving  and obsolete inventory to the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended march    and  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the carrying value of its identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable  or in the case of goodwill  at least annually 
certain factors  which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists  include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to actual historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in the event that the carrying value of assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
events or changes in circumstances could occur that may create underperformance relative to projected future cash fl ows  which could create future impairments 
the company s policy is consistent with current accounting guidance as prescribed by sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impact of inflation for the last several years  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the company s costs 
however  due to the competitive sales pressures in both the fuller brands and imaging segments  any inflation experienced  has generally not been able to be passed on to the customer 
programs stressing productivity improvements  as well as group purchasing efforts should continue to offset potential negative impacts of inflation in the near future 
environmental contingency the company expects to soon receive final acceptance from the state of kansas for remediation work performed in the mid to late s  connected with the company s acquisition of the fuller brush company  inc remediation efforts for the last several years have consisted of minimal monitoring efforts 
management does not believe that the company will incur any significant  future costs related to this project
