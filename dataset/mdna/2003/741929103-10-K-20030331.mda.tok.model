prices in the long distance industry have declined in recent years  and as competition continues to increase  the company believes that prices are likely to continue to decline 
additionally  primus believes that because deregulatory influences affect telecommunications markets outside the united states  the deregulatory trend will result in greater competition which could adversely affect primus s net revenue per minute and gross margin as a percentage of net revenue 
however  the company believes that such decreases in prices will be offset by increased communications usage and decreased costs 
as the portion of traffic transmitted over leased or owned facilities increases  cost of revenue increasingly will be comprised of fixed costs 
in order to manage such costs  primus pursues a flexible approach with respect to the expansion of its network 
in most instances  primus initially obtains transmission capacity on a variable cost  per minute leased basis  then acquires additional capacity on a fixed cost basis when traffic volume makes such a commitment cost effective  and ultimately purchases and operates its own facilities when traffic levels justify such investment 
the company also seeks to lower the cost of revenue through optimizing the routing of calls over the least cost route  negotiating lower variable usage based costs with domestic and foreign service providers and negotiating additional and lower cost foreign carrier agreements with the foreign incumbent carriers and others  and continuing to expand the network when traffic volumes justify such investment 
in most countries  the company generally realizes a higher gross margin as a percentage of net revenue on its international long distance as compared to its domestic long distance services and a higher gross margin as a percentage of net revenue on its services to both business and residential customers compared to those realized on its services to other telecommunications carriers 
in addition  primus generally realizes a higher gross margin as a percentage of net revenue on long distance services as compared to those realized on local switched and cellular services 
carrier services  which generate a lower gross margin as a percentage of net revenue than retail business and residential services  are an important part of net revenue because the additional traffic volume of such carrier customers improves the utilization of the network and allows the company to obtain greater volume discounts from its suppliers than it otherwise would realize 
this interconnection also allows the company to connect to all major carriers which provides worldwide coverage 
primus s overall gross margin as a percentage of net revenue may fluctuate based on the relative volumes of international versus domestic long distance services  carrier services versus business and residential long distance services and the proportion of traffic carried on primus s network versus resale of other carriers services 
selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions  occupancy costs  sales and marketing expenses  advertising and administrative costs 
all selling  general and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred  with the exception of direct response advertising  which is expensed in accordance with statement of position  reporting on advertising costs 
foreign currency a significant portion of the company s net revenue is derived from sales and operations outside the united states 
the reporting currency for the company s consolidated financial statements is the united states dollar 
the local currency of each country is the functional currency for each respective entity 
in the future  primus expects to continue to derive the majority of net revenue and incur a significant portion of its operating costs from outside the united states  and therefore changes in exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant  and potentially adverse  effect on primus s results of operations 
primus historically has not engaged in hedging transactions and does not currently contemplate engaging in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risks 
critical accounting policies to aid in the understanding of the company s financial reporting  the company s most critical accounting policies are described below 
these policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on the company s financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 
revenue recognition net revenue is derived from carrying a mix of business  residential and carrier long distance traffic  data and internet traffic  and also from the provision of local and cellular services 
for voice and voip  net revenue is earned based on the number of minutes during a call and is recorded upon completion of a call  adjusted for allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  service credits and service adjustments 
revenue for a period is calculated from information received through the company s network switches 
customized software has been designed to track the information from the switch and analyze the call detail records against stored detailed information about revenue rates 
this software provides the company the ability to do a more timely and accurate analysis of revenue earned in a period 
separate prepaid vmns and calling card software is used to track additional information related to the cards usage such as activation date  monthly usage amounts and expiration date 
revenues on these cards are recognized as service is provided until expiration  when all unused minutes which are no longer available to the customers  are recognized as revenue 
net revenue is also earned for the provision of data internet services 
data internet services include monthly fees collected for the provision of dedicated and dial up access at various speeds and bandwidths 
these fees are recognized as access is provided on a monthly basis 
additionally  service activation and installation fees are deferred and amortized over the longer of the average customer life or the contract term 
the company records payments received in advance for prepaid vmns and calling card services and services to be provided under contractual agreements  such as internet broadband and dial up access  as deferred revenue until such related services are provided 
deferred revenue is reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
net revenue represents gross revenue  net of allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  service credits and service adjustments 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable determining the company s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable requires significant estimates 
due to the large number of customers that the company serves  it is impractical to review the credit worthiness of each of its customers  although a credit review is performed for larger carrier and retail business customers 
the company considers a number of factors in determining the proper level of the allowance  including historical collection experience  current economic trends  the aging of the accounts receivable portfolio and changes in the credit worthiness of the company s customers 
systems to detect fraudulent call activity are in place within the network of the company  but if these systems fail to identify such activity  the company may realize a higher degree of uncollectible accounts 
if the estimate of uncollectible revenue was higher than the company s current estimates  net revenue would have been reduced by approximately million for the year ended december  cost of revenue cost of revenue is comprised primarily of costs incurred from other domestic and foreign telecommunications carriers to originate  transport and terminate calls 
the majority of primus s cost of revenue is variable  based upon the number of minutes of use  with transmission and termination costs being the most significant expense 
call activity is tracked and analyzed with customized software that analyzes the traffic flowing through the company s network switches and calculates the variable cost of revenue with predetermined contractual rates 
if the domestic or foreign telecommunications carriers have tracked and invoiced the volume of minutes at levels different than what primus s activity shows or have invoiced at different rates  the company will dispute the charges invoiced 
there is no guarantee that the company will prevail in the dispute but realizes a greater success with disputes concerning contracted rates 
primus uses significant estimates to determine the level of success in dispute resolution and considers past historical experience  basis of dispute  financial status and current relationship with vendor  and aging of prior disputes in quantifying its estimates 
valuation of long lived assets the company reviews intangible and other long lived assets whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in making such evaluations  the company compares the expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the total of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the company is required to make estimates of the fair value of the long lived assets in order to calculate the impairment loss equal to the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets 
the company makes significant assumptions and estimates in this process regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  such as estimating cash flows  remaining useful lives  discount rates and growth rates 
the resulting cash flows are computed over an extended period of time  which subjects those assumptions and estimates to an even larger degree of uncertainty 
while the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect the valuation of the long lived assets

if adverse events referenced therein were to occur  the company may not be able to service our debt or other obligations and could  among other things  be required to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws of the united states or other similar laws in other countries 
substantial indebtedness  liquidity 
the company currently has substantial indebtedness and anticipates that it and its subsidiaries will incur additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of the company s indebtedness i could increase interest payment requirements and or make it more difficult for it to make payments of interest on its outstanding debt  ii could limit the ability of the company to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  iii requires that a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations  if any  be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and other obligations and  accordingly  will not be available for use in its business  iv could limit its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business  v results in the company being more highly leveraged than some of its competitors  which may place it at a competitive disadvantage  and vi will make it more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business 
limited operating history  entry into internet  data and voip business  entry into developing markets 
the company was incorporated in february  and began generating revenue in march since  the company has been targeting businesses and residential customers for internet and data services through the primus brand  its subsidiary iprimus 
com and other acquired isps 
the company has been expanding and intends to continue to expand its offering of data internet and voip services worldwide 
the company anticipates offering a broad range of internet protocol based data and voice communications over the global broadband atm ip network which the company has deployed 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will successfully expand the business 
currently  the company provides internet services to business and residential customers in the united states  australia  canada  japan  india  brazil and spain  and offers internet transmission services in the indian ocean southeast asia regions through its satellite earth station in london and its earth stations in india 
the company cannot provide assurance that its future operations involving these services will generate operating or net income  or positive cash flow on a predictable basis 
the market for dial up and broadband internet connectivity and related services is extremely competitive 
the company s primary competitors include incumbent operators and other isps that have a significant national or international presence 
many of these carriers have substantially greater resources  capital and operational experience than the company does 
the company also expects it will experience increased competition from traditional telecommunications carriers that expand into the market for internet services 
managing growth 
the company s history of rapid growth has placed a significant strain on the company in the past 
in order to manage its future growth effectively  the company must continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and controls  purchase and utilize additional transmission facilities  and expand  train and manage its employees  all within a rapidly changing regulatory environment 
inaccuracies in the company s forecast of traffic could result in insufficient or excessive transmission facilities and disproportionate fixed expenses 
historical and future operating losses and net losses 
since inception  the company had cumulative negative cash flow from operating activities 
in addition  the company incurred net losses since inception and has an accumulated deficit of million as of december  there can be no assurance that the company s revenue will grow or be sustained in future periods or that it will be able to achieve or sustain operating profitability  net income or positive cash flow from operations in any future period 
integration of acquired businesses 
acquisitions of businesses and customer lists  a key element in the company s historical growth strategy  involve operational risks  including the possibility that an acquisition does not ultimately provide the benefits originally anticipated by management 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates  completing and financing additional acquisitions on favorable terms  or integrating the acquired business or assets into its own 
there may be difficulty in integrating the service offerings  distribution channels and networks gained through acquisitions with the company s own 
successful integration of operations and technologies requires the dedication of management and other personnel which may distract their attention from the day to day business  the development or acquisition of new technologies  and the pursuit of other business acquisition opportunities  and there can be no assurance that successful integration will occur in light of such events 
intense competition in long distance telecommunications 
the long distance telecommunications and data industry is intensely competitive and is significantly influenced by the marketing and pricing decisions of the larger industry participants 
competition in all of the company s markets is likely to stay intense  or even increase in intensity and  as deregulatory influences are experienced in markets outside the united states  competition in non united states markets is likely to become similar to the intense competition in the united states 
many of the company s competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources and larger networks than the company  a broader portfolio of service offerings  greater control over transmission lines  stronger name recognition and customer loyalty  as well as long standing relationships with the company s target customers 
in addition  many of the company s competitors enjoy economies of scale that result in a lower cost structure for transmission and related costs which could cause significant pricing pressures within the industry 
many companies emerging out of bankruptcy could also end up enjoying a lower cost structure and applying pricing pressure within the industry in order to gain market share 
dependence on transmission facilities based carriers 
the company s ability to maintain and expand its business and effectuate its liquidity objectives is dependent upon whether the company continues to maintain favorable relationships and credit terms with the transmission facilities based carriers to carry the company s traffic 
international operations 
the company has significant international operations 
in many international markets  the incumbent carrier is most likely to control access to the local networks  enjoy better brand recognition and brand and customer loyalty  and have significant operational economies  including a larger backbone network and correspondent agreements 
moreover  the incumbent carrier may take many months to allow competitors  including the company  to interconnect to its switches within its territory 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the permits and operating licenses required for it to operate  obtain access to local transmission facilities or to market services in international markets 
in addition  operating in international markets generally involves additional risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political risks  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  foreign exchange controls which restrict repatriation of funds  technology export and import restrictions  and seasonal reductions in business activity 
with respect to currency exchange rates risks  adverse exchange rate developments have had a negative impact on recent operating results  and there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate conditions will improve 
dependence on effective information systems 
the company s management information systems must grow as the company s business expands and are expected to change as new technological developments occur 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter delays or cost overruns or suffer adverse consequences in implementing new systems when required 
industry changes 
the international telecommunications industry is changing rapidly due to deregulation  privatization  technological improvements  expansion of infrastructure and the globalization of the world s economies 
in order to compete effectively  the company must adjust its contemplated plan of development to meet changing market conditions 
the telecommunications industry is marked by the introduction of new product and service offerings and technological improvements 
the company s profitability will depend on its ability to anticipate  assess and adapt to rapid technological changes and its ability to offer  on a timely and cost effective basis  services that meet evolving industry standards 
network development  migration of traffic 
the long term success of the company is dependent upon its ability to design  implement  operate  manage and maintain a reliable and cost effective network 
the company could experience delays or cost overruns in the implementation of the network  or its ability to migrate traffic onto its network  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
dependence on key personnel 
the loss of the services of k 
paul singh  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  or the services of its other key personnel  or the inability of the company to attract and retain additional key management  technical and sales personnel  could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
government regulation 
the company s operations are subject to constantly changing regulation 
there can be no assurance that future regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company  or that regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to the company s compliance or non compliance with applicable regulations  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
natural disasters 
many of the geographic areas where the company conducts its business may be affected by natural disasters  including hurricanes and tropical storms 
hurricanes  tropical storms and other natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on the business by damaging the network facilities or curtailing voice or data traffic as a result of the effects of such events  such as destruction of homes and businesses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposures relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency a significant portion of net revenue is derived from sales and operations outside the united states 
the reporting currency for the company s consolidated financial statements is the united states dollar 
the local currency of each country is the functional currency for each respective entity 
in the future  the company expects to continue to derive a significant portion of its net revenue and incur a significant portion of its operating costs outside the united states  and changes in exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant  and potentially adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused primarily by fluctuations in the following exchange rates united states dollar australian dollar  united states dollar canadian dollar  united states dollar united kingdom pound  and united states dollar euro dollar 
due to the large percentage of the company s revenues derived outside of the united states  strengthening of the united states dollar would have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the operations of affiliates and subsidiaries in foreign countries have been funded with investments and other advances 
historically  such investments and advances have been long term in nature  and the company accounted for any adjustments resulting from translation as a charge or credit to accumulated other comprehensive income loss within the stockholders deficit section of the consolidated balance sheets 
in  agreements with certain subsidiaries were put in place for repayment of investments and advances made to the subsidiaries 
as the company is anticipating repayment in the foreseeable future of these amounts  the company recognized the unrealized gains in foreign currency transaction gain loss on the consolidated statements of operations 
interest rates a substantial majority of the company s long term debt obligations are at fixed interest rates 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk as additional financing may be required and certain of its long term obligations are at variable interest rates 
the company s primary exposure to market risk stems from fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s interest rate risk related to the variable interest rate long term obligations results from changes in the united states libor  british pound libor  bloomberg bbswib  united states prime and canada prime rates 
the company does not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swaps and or similar instruments 
the estimated fair value of the company s convertible debentures   and senior notes carrying value of million  based on quoted market prices  at december  was million 
the interest rate sensitivity table below summarizes our market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates as of december  in united states dollars  which is the company s reporting currency 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity for our senior notes  convertible subordinated debentures  leased fiber capacity  equipment financing  and other long term obligations in effect at december  in the case of the senior notes  and convertible debentures the table excludes the potential exercise of the relevant redemption and conversion features
