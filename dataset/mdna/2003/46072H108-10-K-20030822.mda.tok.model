item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview interstate bakeries corporation is the largest wholesale baker and distributor of fresh baked bread and sweet goods in the united states  producing  marketing  distributing and selling a wide range of breads  rolls  croutons  snack cakes  donuts  sweet rolls and related products 
our various brands are positioned across a wide spectrum of consumer categories and price points 
we operate bakeries and approximately  thrift stores located in strategic markets throughout the united states 
our sales force delivers baked goods from our more than  distribution centers to more than  food outlets and stores on approximately  delivery routes 
our net sales are affected by various factors  including our marketing programs  competitors activities and consumer preferences 
see business trends  risks and uncertainties 
we recognize sales  net of estimated credits for dated and damaged products  when our products are delivered to our customers 
our cost of products sold consists of employee costs  ingredients  packaging  energy and other production costs 
the primary ingredients used in producing our products are flour  yeast  sweeteners  edible oils and the ingredients used to produce our extended shelf life products 
see business trends  risks and uncertainties 
our selling  delivery and administrative expenses include the employee costs and transportation costs of delivering our product to our customers  the employee costs  occupancy and other selling costs of our thrift stores  the costs of marketing our products and other general sales and administrative costs not directly related to production 
see business trends  risks and uncertainties 
we end our fiscal year on the saturday closest to the last day of may 
consequently  most years contain weeks of operating results while every fifth or sixth year includes weeks 
in addition  each quarter of our fiscal year represents a period of weeks  except the third quarter  which covers weeks  and the fourth quarter of any week year  which covers weeks 
significant events in fiscal fiscal was a challenging year for us 
we saw volume declines in both branded cake and branded bread sales 
we also experienced increased costs on numerous fronts  most notably health care and commodities  primarily sweeteners  cocoa  edible oils and natural gas 
see results of operations regarding the impact of these items on our fiscal operating results 
in response to these trends  we commenced a major  company wide project internally referred to as program soar  an acronym for systems optimization and re engineering 
this program was instituted to focus on re engineering our business processes to increase efficiency and on rationalizing our investment in production  distribution and administrative functionality to reduce the ongoing cost of supporting this infrastructure 
see cash resources and liquidity regarding future costs and savings from program soar 
during fiscal  we initiated plans to restructure certain of our operations by closing five bakeries and thrift stores 
we expect to incur additional restructuring charges in an as yet unknown amount in fiscal in connection with these activities 
also  as we continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our manufacturing and distribution cost structures under our program soar initiative  we may incur additional restructuring charges in future periods 
see cash resources and liquidity regarding future savings from these restructurings 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based upon many factors  including historical experience  consultation with outside professionals  such as actuaries  and management s judgment 
actual results could differ from any estimates made and results could be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 

table of contents we believe the following represents our critical accounting policies and estimates  involving those areas of financial statement preparation which are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
reserves for self insurance and postretirement benefits 
we retain various levels of insurance risks related to active employee health care costs  workers compensation claims  liability insurance claims and postretirement health care costs 
many of our workers compensation and liability losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductible limits 
we are self insured  with some stop loss protection  for other losses and for health care costs 
we also actively pursue programs intended to effectively manage the incidence of workplace injuries 
reserves for reported but unpaid losses  as well as incurred but not reported losses  related to our retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors  as well as other assumptions considered by management  including assumptions provided by our external insurance brokers  consultants and actuaries 
the factors and assumptions used are subject to change based upon historical experience  as well as changes in expected cost trends  particularly health care  as well as discount rates and other factors 
the reserves  including both the current and long term portions  recorded by us for these liabilities amounted to  and  at may  and june   respectively 
the increase in these reserves from fiscal to was attributable in large part to changes in experience factors and expected cost trends related primarily to health care costs 
long lived assets 
property and equipment purchases are recorded at cost or fair market value when acquired as part of a business acquisition 
these assets are depreciated based on useful lives  developed by historical experience and management s judgment 
we assess the net realizable value of our long lived assets whenever events occur which indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be impaired 
the assessment involves comparing the asset s estimated fair value to its carrying value  with the impairment loss measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  principally trademarks and trade names acquired in business acquisitions  are no longer amortized due to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
during the first quarter of fiscal in addition  during fiscal we have performed impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and determined that no impairments existed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we must assess our goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually 
long lived assets recorded in our consolidated financial statements at may   include  of net property and equipment   of goodwill and  of other intangible assets with indefinite lives  while amounts of   and  respectively  were recorded at june  derivative instruments 
we use derivative instruments  including exchange traded futures and options on wheat  corn  soybean oil and certain fuels and forward purchase contracts on many ingredient  packaging and energy needs  to manage the price and supply risks associated with these commodities 
when possible  we establish hedging positions that qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
however  we may from time to time enter into contracts for economic reasons which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatments or market conditions may occur which render our hedging strategies ineffective and thus not qualified for further hedge accounting treatment 
if either of these scenarios occur  the related hedged positions must be marked to market as of the end of each quarter in which the positions exist 
as the commodities underlying our hedges can experience significant price fluctuations  any requirement to marked to market the related hedged positions could result in significant volatility in our costs of products sold and delivery costs recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
restructuring charges 
costs associated with any plan to reorganize our operational infrastructure are generally identified and reported as other charges in our consolidated statements of income 
these reorganizing efforts include the closure of a bakery  the partial shut down of a bakery s production  the closing of distribution and thrift store operations  relocation of bakery equipment  production or distribution to another facility  centralization of work effort and other organizational changes 
costs associated with restructurings are expensed when the related liability is incurred 
management judgments are made with regard to the incurrence of restructure related liabilities  as well as impairment of long term assets as described above 
we incurred restructuring charges during fiscal and and anticipate additional such charges in future years

results of operations the following table sets forth  for fiscal years  and  the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales weeks ended may  weeks ended june  weeks ended june  net sales cost of products sold selling  delivery and administrative expenses other charges depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense net income before income taxes income tax expense net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for the weeks ended may   were  a decrease of  or  from net sales of  for the weeks ended june  the decline in net sales in fiscal reflected a unit volume decline of approximately  partially offset by price increases of less than compared to fiscal gross profit 
gross profit was  or of net sales  for fiscal  down from  or of net sales  in fiscal our fiscal gross profit margins were negatively impacted by higher ingredient costs  including cocoa  sweeteners  edible oils and the ingredient costs associated with producing our extended shelf life products 
the increase in ingredient costs accounted for of our gross profit decline as a percent of net sales for fiscal in addition  higher employee costs for health care  pension benefits and workers compensation claims accounted for of the gross profit decline as a percent of net sales for fiscal the remaining variances for fiscal were composed of items that represented or less of net sales 
selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
selling  delivery and administrative expenses were  representing of net sales  for fiscal  up somewhat from fiscal s selling  delivery and administrative expenses of  or of net sales 
higher costs for employee benefits  principally health care and pension  and workers compensation claims  were responsible for of the increase as a percent of net sales for fiscal partially offsetting these increases was a reduction on a percent of net sales basis in advertising expense for fiscal the remaining variances for fiscal were composed of items that represented or less of net sales 

table of contents other charges 
during fiscal  we incurred restructuring charges of  related to closures of five bakeries and thrift stores and restructurings of several other bakeries 
approximately  represents severance and other cash costs and  represents impairment of bakery machinery and equipment 
as part of various initiatives intended to reduce our manufacturing and distribution cost structures  the completion of our new bakery in henderson  nevada  as well as improvements to several other facilities  allowed us to close less efficient operations 
the severance charge for fiscal is associated with the involuntary employee separation of approximately employees 
as of may   employee separations had been completed 
we anticipate employee separations to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal see the cash resources and liquidity section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding future expected restructuring charges 
also  in fiscal  other charges included an october  fully vested common stock award of  to our former chief executive officer 
other charges of  incurred in fiscal related to the closure of a bakery and the settlement of employment discrimination litigation 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal was  or of net sales  down from the prior year s operating income of  or of net sales 
as mentioned above  we incurred  in other charges in fiscal we incurred other charges of  in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal was  up  from interest expense in fiscal of  the impact on interest expense of slightly higher borrowing levels during fiscal was offset by the impact of slightly lower interest rates 
in addition  during fiscal  we reclassified  to interest expense from other comprehensive loss resulting from the amendment of some of our interest rate swap agreements see note to our consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense 
the effective income tax rates were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net income 
net income for fiscal was  or per diluted share  compared to net income of  or per diluted share in fiscal included in the fiscal results were restructuring charges of per diluted share and other charges amounting to per diluted share 
included in the fiscal results were other charges amounting to per diluted share 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for the weeks ended june   were  an increase of  or  over net sales of  for the weeks ended june  improved unit volume during the latter half of fiscal accounted for approximately of this increase  while slightly higher selling prices for fiscal accounted for approximately of the increase 
gross profit 
gross profit was  or of net sales  for fiscal  up from  or of net sales  in fiscal our gross profit margins were favorably impacted by savings from producing less product because of higher customer sell through percentages of our products  as well as operational efficiencies and somewhat lower energy costs 
the need to produce less product is a result of our new extended shelf life  or esl  program 
partially offsetting the favorable impact of these items were higher ingredient costs  due in part to the esl program  and employee benefits  principally health care and pension costs 
these items were less than of net sales 
selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
selling  delivery and administrative expenses were  representing of net sales  for fiscal  up slightly from fiscal s selling  delivery and administrative expenses of  or of net sales 
this slight improvement as a percentage of net sales reflects the favorable impact of a reduced number of delivery routes resulting from our esl program and lower energy costs of as a percent of net sales  offset by higher employee benefit costs of as a percent of net sales 
other charges 
other charges of  in fiscal relate to the closure of a bakery and the settlement of employment discrimination litigation 

table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was  for fiscal  down  from  in fiscal the primary reason for this decrease was our adoption on june  of sfas no 
 which eliminated the amortization of purchased goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives 
for further information regarding the impact of this accounting change  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
operating income 
based upon the above factors  operating income for fiscal was  or of net sales  compared to fiscal s operating income of  or of net sales 
as mentioned above  we incurred  in other charges in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal was  decreasing  from interest expense in fiscal of  this decline reflects lower borrowing levels throughout most of fiscal  as well as somewhat lower interest rates 
income tax expense 
the effective income tax rates were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the rate for fiscal included related to nondeductible intangibles amortization 
we did not amortize these intangibles during fiscal  due to our adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter 
net income 
net income for fiscal was  or per diluted share  compared to net income of  or per diluted share in fiscal included in the fiscal results were other charges amounting to per diluted share 
the effect on fiscal net income relating to the adoption of sfas no 
during fiscal  as discussed above  was per diluted share 
cash resources and liquidity cash from operating activities for fiscal was  down  from cash generated in fiscal of  this decrease was primarily attributable to lower net income 
cash from operating activities  along with proceeds from stock option exercises  was used to fund capital expenditures of  purchase software of  pay common stock dividends of  and reduce debt outstanding by our planned cash needs for fiscal include approximately  consisting of  of required debt repayments   of obligations under capital leases   of obligations under operating leases   of common stock dividends and  of capital expenditures  including those related to program soar 
we believe cash from ongoing operations  along with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated cash needs through fiscal if we are not able to fund our requirements through cash flow from operations  we may seek additional sources of financing 
in either case  additional sources of financing may not be available when needed or may not be available on acceptable terms 
in addition  we may purchase up to  shares under our stock repurchase program  previously approved by the board of directors 
as previously announced  our board of directors declared a common stock dividend of per share on august  to shareholders on record as of july  however  if cash flow from operations is not sufficient to allow for payment of additional common stock dividends in fiscal  such dividends may be discontinued 
we have commenced a major  company wide project that we refer to as program soar  an acronym for systems optimization and re engineering 
this program will focus on re engineering our business processes to increase efficiency and on rationalizing our investment in production  distribution and administrative functionality to reduce the ongoing cost of supporting this infrastructure 
an operating team has been assigned to focus on nine initiatives that have been identified as major areas for profit improvement 
the operating team is being supported by a national consulting firm with significant experience in these types of programs in the baking and food industry 
the initial phase of this comprehensive review of operational processes has just been completed 
in conjunction with program soar  we have undertaken a comprehensive review of all aspects of our operations at two of our underperforming bakeries 
this review is expected to result in an improvement in profitability at these two locations in fiscal through a concentrated emphasis on identifying efficiencies in the day to day production and sales work flow processes and retraining personnel in proper execution 
we hope to utilize this information from this effort as a roadmap to instituting more efficient processes at other locations 
direct costs of the three year program are expected to be approximately  with the majority of these costs related to software and hardware acquisition and consulting fees 
approximately  was spent on this program in fiscal we estimate pre tax savings  after related program soar expenses  for fiscal to be approximately  to  approximately  to  net of income taxes 
as part of the program  additional costs are anticipated as we identify and implement 
table of contents strategies which are expected to provide future savings 
we hope to achieve positive cumulative cash flow from this program by the end of fiscal however  there can be no assurance that this will be achieved 
during fiscal  we restructured certain of our operations by closing five bakeries and thrift stores 
the remaining  of unpaid cash costs at may  related to these restructurings are expected to be paid by the second quarter of fiscal  but we expect to incur additional restructuring charges during fiscal in connection with these restructurings 
in addition  as we continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our manufacturing and distribution cost structures  we may incur additional restructuring charges in future periods 
as a result of the fiscal restructurings  we estimate pre tax annual savings to be approximately  to  approximately  to  net of income taxes 
cost of products sold is anticipated to decline between  and  selling  delivery and administrative costs are expected to decline between  and  and approximately  will be non cash savings related to depreciation expense 
future savings are difficult to estimate and could change depending on market conditions  consolidation difficulties or other factors 
on april   we amended certain financial covenants on our senior secured credit facilities 
while we were in compliance with all covenant requirements  our performance had raised the possibility that these requirements might not be satisfied going forward 
therefore  we worked with our lenders to amend the credit facilities to provide added flexibility 
as part of our covenants  we are required to satisfy certain ratios related to interest coverage and leverage and maintain a minimum net worth 
we have amended the interest coverage and leverage requirements for the next six quarters  or through the first quarter of fiscal at that time  the covenant requirements will revert to the original requirements 
as a result of this amendment and a lowered senior security rating by a rating agency on april   we expect additional annual pre tax interest expense of approximately  however  fiscal will reflect a favorable impact on interest expense compared to fiscal due to amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income oci to interest expense during fiscal related to accumulated losses on amended swap agreements see note to our consolidated financial statements 
this year over year impact is expected to offset a substantial portion of the increased interest expense as discussed above 
we amended and extended some of our interest rate swap agreements during the first quarter of fiscal based upon current debt ratings  our current interest rate swap agreements fix interest rates on  in variable rate debt to fixed rates ranging from to with termination dates ranging from april to august we have seen costs for some of our principal commodities  primarily sweeteners  cocoa  edible oils and natural gas  rise sharply during the past year and we cannot be assured that these costs will return to more historical levels in the near future 
we currently have coverage on the majority of our major commodities through the second quarter of fiscal at costs exceeding those experienced in the prior fiscal year 
given current market conditions  as well as our current hedged positions  we could have a significant year over year increase in commodity costs 
we have historically attempted to offset cost increases with selling price increases and operational efficiencies but in fiscal increasing our selling prices generally had a negative impact on volume 
given current economic conditions  we believe that price increases may also negatively impact volume in fiscal if we are not successful in offsetting cost increases with pricing and efficiencies  such cost increases could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
in addition  during fiscal we saw increases in employee benefit costs  primarily health care and pension  and workers compensation costs 
we see no indications given current market conditions to suggest that these costs will not continue to rise in fiscal 
table of contents the following is a summary of certain of our contractual obligations as of may  and the anticipated impact these obligations will have on future cash flows in thousands payments due by fiscal year under certain contractual obligations fiscal years total revolving credit line a long term debt a capital leases operating leases b unconditional purchase obligations c thereafter total a borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are secured by all of our accounts receivable and a majority of our owned real property  intellectual property and equipment 
the revolving credit line has a total capacity of  and allows up to  for letters of credit 
we had borrowings outstanding of  under the revolving credit line and  in letters of credit outstanding as of may  b at may   we have in place various operating leases on equipment which guarantee the equipment s residual fair market value at lease termination 
these leases were entered into on dates from june  through december  and expire on dates from june  through december  the maximum potential amount of future guarantees is  in accordance with fin  these guarantees have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of may   as they were in existence prior to the effective date of the interpretation 
c the unconditional purchase obligations represent advance purchase contracts for ingredients and packaging to assure supplies and limit price risks 
off balance sheet financing we do not participate in  nor secure financings for  any unconsolidated  special purpose entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks relative to commodity price fluctuations and interest rate changes 
we actively manage these risks through the use of forward purchase contracts and derivative financial instruments 
as a matter of policy  we use derivative financial instruments only for hedging purposes  and the use of derivatives for trading and speculative purposes is prohibited 
commodity prices 
commodities we use in the production of our products are subject to wide price fluctuations  depending upon factors such as weather  crop production  worldwide market supply and demand and government regulation 
to reduce the risk associated with commodity price fluctuations  primarily for wheat  corn  sweeteners  soybean oil and certain fuels  we sometimes enter into forward purchase contracts and commodity futures and options in order to fix prices for future periods 
a sensitivity analysis was prepared and  based upon our commodity related derivatives positions as of may   an assumed adverse change in commodity prices would not have a material effect on our fair values  future earnings or cash flows 
interest rates 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate risk associated with variable rate debt instruments 
based upon current debt ratings  our current interest rate swap agreements fix interest rates on  in variable rate debt to fixed rates ranging from to with termination dates ranging from april to august based upon a sensitivity analysis at may   an assumed adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our fair values  future earnings or cash flows
