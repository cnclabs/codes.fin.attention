item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed below under the headings consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and  liquidity and capital resources and elsewhere in this annual report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
readers should be cautioned that a number of important factors  including those identified above in item special note regarding forward looking statements and risks related to our business and our industry may affect actual results and may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or expected in any forward looking statement 
we develop and manufacture small space systems for commercial  civil government and military customers 
our primary products are spacecraft and launch vehicles  including low orbit  geosynchronous and planetary spacecraft for communications  remote sensing  scientific and military missions  ground and air launched rockets that deliver satellites into orbit  and suborbital rockets that are used as interceptor boost and target vehicles 
we also offer space related technical services to government agencies and develop and build satellite based transportation management systems for public transit agencies and private vehicle fleet operators 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
such judgments affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continuously evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to long term contracts and incentives  inventories  long lived assets  warranty obligations  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a summary of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our revenue is derived primarily from long term contracts 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned 
revenues on long term fixed price contracts are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revenues are recorded based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to the most recent estimates of total costs to complete each contract 
estimating future costs and  therefore  revenues and profits  is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment  including management s assumptions regarding future operations of the company as well as general economic conditions 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period the change in estimate occurs 
frequently  the period of performance of a contract extends over a long period of time and  as such  revenue recognition and our profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected to the extent that estimated cost to complete or incentive or award fee estimates are revised  delivery schedules are delayed  or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded 
accordingly  our recorded revenues and gross profits from year to year can fluctuate significantly 
in the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract  the total amount of such loss  excluding general and administrative expense  is recorded in the period in which the loss is first estimated 
certain contracts include incentive provisions for increased or decreased revenue and profit based on actual performance against established targets 
incentive and award fees are included in estimated contract revenue at the time the amounts can be reasonably determined and are reasonably assured based on historical experience and other objective criteria 
should we fail to perform satisfactorily under such contracts  previously recognized revenues could be reversed and or future period revenues could be reduced 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
estimated market value is determined based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those previously projected by management  inventory write downs may be required 
we self construct some of our ground and airborne support equipment and special test equipment utilized in the manufacture  production and delivery of some of our products 
we capitalize direct costs incurred in constructing such equipment and certain allocated indirect costs 
recovery of these capitalized costs is subject to the continuation of certain of our long term contracts and could be adversely impacted by technological changes and innovation 
we record a liability in connection with various warranty obligations 
our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  resulting in additional income statement charges 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
we use the equity method of accounting for affiliates that we have the ability to significantly influence but not control 
in accordance with the equity method of accounting  we record our allocated share of the affiliate s income or losses 
we continue to recognize equity losses of an affiliate even if such losses exceed our book value of such affiliate  to the extent we are otherwise committed to provide additional funding to such affiliate 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and revenues our consolidated revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
consolidated revenues increased in primarily as a result of revenue growth in our launch vehicle and satellite segments  discussed more fully in segment results below 
consolidated revenues increased in primarily as a result of new launch vehicle contracts and new and existing electronic systems contracts 
consolidated revenues in included million from sales to our unconsolidated affiliates  orbcomm global  lp orbcomm and orbital imaging corporation orbimage 
we stopped recognizing revenues on sales to orbcomm and orbimage effective june and july  respectively  as a result of the weakened financial condition of these entities 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit was million of revenues  million of revenues and  in  and  respectively 
gross profit is affected by a number of factors  including the mix of contract types and costs incurred thereon in relation to revenues recognized 
such costs include the costs of personnel  materials  subcontracts and overhead 
gross profit in improved significantly compared to gross profit in as a result of increased revenues  the absence in of certain charges recorded in and a reduction in contract losses in in our satellite manufacturing business 
gross profit in was adversely affected by a million charge in the fourth quarter of to write down inventory related to the orbview satellite and to accrue for the expected remaining costs to complete this contract and by million of other contract related charges 
gross profit in was also adversely impacted by cost overruns and contract losses related to certain other satellite construction contracts  although these losses were not as large as similar contract losses in these charges and contract losses in were partially offset by a million favorable revenue and gross profit adjustment as a result of a contract settlement reached with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa that is discussed below 
gross profit in was adversely affected by significant cost overruns and contract losses related to a few major satellite contracts  including the company s procurement contract with orbimage 
costs related to the termination of an electronic systems contract also contributed to the lower gross profit in as discussed more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements  we had a contract with nasa to construct and test several x reusable rocketplanes 
nasa terminated this contract for convenience in march  prior to the issuance of the financial statements 
as a result of the contract termination  in the fourth quarter of we recorded an asset impairment charge of million to write down assets unique to this contract  and we recorded a million provision for potentially uncollectible receivables 
in august  we received a million provisional settlement payment from nasa  and we reversed the million provision for uncollectible receivables in the second quarter of in january  nasa and orbital settled and closed out the contract for an additional payment of million to us 
accordingly  we recorded a favorable revenue and net income adjustment of million per common and diluted share in the fourth quarter of research and development expenses research and development expenses represent our self funded product research and development activities and exclude direct customer funded development activities 
research and development expenses were million of revenues  million of revenues and million of revenues in  and  respectively 
research and development expenses in decreased compared to primarily due to completion of development activity on two advanced programs and lower expenditures on certain satellite programs  offset partially by increased development activity on a modified taurus launch vehicle 
research and development expenses in and related primarily to the development of improved launch vehicles and satellites 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million of revenues  million of revenues and million of revenues in  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing  advertising  promotional and other selling expenses  as well as the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily attributable to certain charges in that included a million provision for unoccupied office space and facility sublease losses and a million provision for estimated unrecoverable amounts related to the orbview satellite construction program  offset partly by the reversal of a million provision for x contract receivables discussed above 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily attributable to the absence in of certain charges recorded in and the reversal in of the million provision for x contract receivables  offset partially by certain charges in discussed above 
in  we recorded a million provision for unoccupied office space and facility sublease losses  the million provision for x contract receivables previously mentioned  and a million provision for orbimage related receivables 
amortization of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

allocated share of losses of affiliates we did not record any income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates in the allocated share of losses of unconsolidated affiliates in and was as follows in thousands years ended december  orbcomm orbimage other we accounted for our limited partnership interest in orbcomm using the equity method of accounting through the second quarter of as a result of orbcomm s chapter filing in september  we wrote off our million investment in orbcomm in and  accordingly  we ceased recognizing equity losses for orbcomm 
orbcomm s liquidating plan of reorganization became effective in the fourth quarter of in connection with confirmation of the reorganization plan  we contributed approximately million shares of our common stock to the orbcomm estate and recorded a million charge for the fair value of such shares 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  through june  we recognized of orbimage s losses  including preferred stock dividends  in allocated share of losses of affiliates in the statements of operations 
no such losses were recognized in or in the second half of provision for income taxes in we recorded a provision for income taxes of  related to state income taxes 
we did not record a provision for us federal income taxes in because we utilized prior net operating losses to offset all current us federal taxable income 
we did not record an income tax benefit in or related to the losses for those periods because such benefit could not be reasonably assured from future operating results 
in  we recorded a million income tax provision to provide a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are used to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized 
income loss from continuing operations our consolidated income loss from continuing operations was million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
results from continuing operations in reflected a million improvement relative to this improvement was primarily due to improved operating results and lower interest expense in  in addition to the absence of allocated share of losses of an affiliate  which totaled million in the decrease in losses from continuing operations from to is primarily attributable to orbcomm related charges described above which were recorded in discontinued operations during and  we sold various equity investments  divisions and subsidiaries 
in  we sold magellan corporation magellan  our interest in navigation solutions llc navsol  our sensors systems division sensors  and our entire remaining interest in macdonald  dettwiler and associates ltd 
mda 
in  we sold our fairchild defense electronics business unit fairchild  and mda completed an initial public offering of common stock 
these transactions resulted in net gains of million  million and million in  and  respectively  reported in discontinued operations 
the losses from operations related to these businesses  also reported in discontinued operations  were million and million in and  respectively 
cumulative effect of change in accounting in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we recorded a million impairment loss in our electronic systems segment to write off the remaining net book value of goodwill in this segment 
the impairment loss was determined based on a comparison of the fair value of our electronic systems reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
the fair value of our electronic systems reporting unit  and the resulting implied fair value of goodwill  were estimated after consideration of letters of interest in respect of purchase offers received by us in early during our attempts to sell the electronic systems business 
the impairment loss was recorded as a january  cumulative effect of a change in accounting 
net income loss our net income for was million  or per share  as compared to million  or per share  for the decrease in net income was attributable to the million increase in income from continuing operations as discussed above offset by the impact of certain significant factors in both and net income for included million income from continuing operations in addition to million of income related to previously discontinued operations  offset by the million goodwill impairment charge discussed above 
net income for included a million loss from continuing operations and million of income from discontinued operations 
our net loss for was million  which reflected a loss of million from continuing operations and income from discontinued operations of million 
segment results our products and services are grouped into three reportable segments i launch vehicles and advanced programs  ii satellites and related space systems and iii electronic systems 
all other activities of the company  as well as consolidating eliminations and adjustments  are reported in corporate and other 
the following tables summarize revenues and income loss from operations from our reportable business segments and corporate and other in thousands years ended december  revenues launch vehicles and advanced programs satellites and related space systems electronic systems corporate and other total years ended december  income loss from operations launch vehicles and advanced programs satellites and related space systems electronic systems corporate and other orbcomm write off litigation related settlements total launch vehicles and advanced programs revenues in this segment increased in as compared to due primarily to growth in revenues on our missile defense boost vehicle program under a multi year contract with the boeing company 
this contract generated million and million of revenues in and  respectively 
additionally  continuing progress on several suborbital programs and a new taurus launch vehicle contract for an international customer contributed to the increase in launch vehicle revenues  offset partially by a reduction in pegasus launch vehicle revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in advanced programs revenues in due primarily to a million favorable revenue and income adjustment recorded in related to the x program  discussed above in consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and revenues in this segment increased in as compared to due to a million increase in revenues from launch vehicles that was partly offset by a million decrease in revenues from advanced programs 
the increase in launch vehicle revenues was largely attributable to increased suborbital business  including million in revenue attributable to the missile defense boost vehicle program mentioned above and an increase in revenues on the supersonic sea skimming target ssst development program for the us navy  which contributed million in revenue in  or million more than in the prior year 
offsetting these increases in launch vehicle revenues was the absence of revenue on the orbimage and orbcomm contracts in  which totaled million in  and a slowdown in our minotaur space launch program with the us air force 
revenues from advanced programs decreased in as compared to primarily as a result of the termination for convenience of the x program in march operating income for launch vehicles and advanced programs increased in as compared to primarily attributable to the operating profit contributed by the missile defense boost vehicle program  in addition to increases in operating income in on several other programs and the absence of million in other contract related charges recorded in these increases were offset in part by reductions in our pegasus space launch services activity and by cost growth on our ssst program 
further  operating income for advanced programs decreased in as compared to primarily due to the x adjustments recorded in discussed above  partially offset by lower research and development expenses in and the absence of a litigation settlement charge recorded in additionally  the absence of goodwill amortization in  which was million in  contributed to an improvement in operating income 
operating income from launch vehicles and advanced programs increased in as compared to primarily due to the x adjustments recorded in and discussed above 
launch vehicle operating income was higher in as compared to primarily due to profits on contracts awarded in for new suborbital business and improved margins on space launch vehicle programs  offset in part by million of other contract related charges recorded in satellites and related space systems revenues from satellites and related space systems increased in as compared to due to increases in all of our major satellite and related space systems product lines 
the largest increase was from our geosynchronous communications satellite product line with revenues increasing from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to production work on three new satellite orders received in late  offset by lower revenues in from the n starc contract that was completed in the third quarter of as well as lower revenues from two bsat satellites that were completed in in our science and technology satellite product line  revenues increased million primarily due to production work on a new scientific satellite contract received in early  offset partially by a decrease in revenue due to completion of a scientific satellite for nasa 
our technical services product line and other revenues increased by million  primarily due to work performed in on a us government research contract 
revenues from satellites and related space systems decreased in as compared to  in spite of the significant increase in revenues attributable to our geosynchronous communications satellite product line  which increased from million in to million in revenues from our other product lines decreased by million from to due in part to the completion of the construction phase in of a scientific satellite for nasa  the absence in of orbcomm and orbimage procurement contract revenues  which totaled million in  and an approximately million decrease in revenues from our technical services business 
the operating results in our satellites and related space systems segment improved from an operating loss of million in to an operating profit of million in this improvement was due to a number of factors 
first  operating results improved due to a reduction in losses and non recurring development and production costs in our geosynchronous satellite product line  primarily associated with the n starc and bsat geosynchronous satellite programs 
the launch failure of the bsat b satellite in contributed to the operating loss in the geosynchronous satellite product line in we received insurance proceeds in connection with the launch failure  however  these proceeds were recorded in in other income  net  as discussed above in other income  net under consolidated results of operations for the years ended december    and second  our science and technology satellite product line experienced significant improvement primarily driven by the absence in of a loss recorded in connection with the launch failure of the orbview quiktoms mission in and a significant reduction in charges related to the orbview program 
in the fourth quarter of we recorded a million charge for the expected remaining costs to complete the orbview satellite  and in the fourth quarter of we recorded a million charge to write down inventory and accrue for the expected remaining costs to complete this satellite 
third  our technical services product line improved in as compared to largely due to the sale of satellite inventory that had previously been fully reserved 
finally  beginning in  goodwill amortization was no longer recorded  resulting in an operating profit improvement of million 
the operating loss from satellites and related space systems increased in as compared to primarily as a result of the previously mentioned million charge in the fourth quarter of related to orbview excluding the orbview charge  the operating loss from satellites and related space systems decreased by million in as compared to largely due to the completion of certain satellite contracts for which we had experienced significant cost overruns in we experienced cost growth in due to non recurring development and production work on the n starc and bsat contracts 
electronic systems revenue from electronic systems in was approximately the same as revenue from this segment in revenue earned in on new contracts awarded in late and early was offset by decreased revenue in from various existing contracts 
revenues from electronic systems increased in as compared to primarily as a result of new contracts won in operating income from electronic systems decreased million in as compared to primarily as a result of charges totaling million in to write down excess inventory offset in part by the absence in of goodwill amortization  which was million in operating income from electronic systems increased in as compared to due primarily to a decrease in product development costs in and contract termination costs incurred in corporate and other revenue adjustments in corporate and other in all three years include the elimination of intercompany revenues  and in include adjustments to properly report revenues on certain contracts that are performed by more than one business unit 
such eliminations and adjustments were approximately the same in as compared to the reduction in such eliminations and adjustments in as compared to was primarily attributable to a reduction of intercompany revenues and the absence in of consolidation adjustments related to the orbimage  orbcomm and x contracts 
corporate and other expenses include corporate general and administrative activities that are not allocated to the operating segments  as well as consolidating adjustments for intercompany contracts 
corporate and other expenses in included a million provision for potentially unrecoverable amounts related to the orbview satellite construction program and a million provision for unoccupied office space and facility sublease losses 
corporate and other expenses in included a million write off related to orbimage administrative services accounts receivable  a million write off of other assets and a million provision for unoccupied office space and facility sublease losses 
corporate and other expenses for also included consolidating entries related to the orbcomm and orbimage contracts 
additionally  corporate and other expenses for and included corporate general and administrative expenses attributed to discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities we reported a million net use of cash from continuing operations in  as compared to a million net use of cash from continuing operations in and a million net increase in cash provided by continuing operations in the million net use of cash in continuing operations in was primarily attributable to cash used to fund our operations together with a reduction in accounts payable  largely attributable to the payment of a million vendor financing obligation 
the million of cash used in continuing operations in was primarily attributable to our operating loss and a million increase in receivables 
in  cash used to fund our operating loss was offset largely by a reduction of receivables and an increase in payables and accrued expenses 
cash flows from investing activities our investing activities used million in for capital expenditures 
our investing activities provided million and million of cash during and  respectively  primarily due to the sales of assets and subsidiary equity in those two years 
in  we sold our entire remaining interest in mda  our interests in magellan and navsol and our sensors unit for net proceeds of million 
in  the sale of fairchild and mda s initial public offering of common stock provided net proceeds of million 
the cash proceeds from these transactions were partially offset by capital expenditures in and and by cash used in our discontinued operations in cash flows from financing activities our financing activities provided approximately million in  consisting of million in net proceeds from issuances of long term debt and warrants and million from issuances of common stock  less million in principal payments on long term debt 
the net proceeds from issuances of long term debt and warrants reflect million in net proceeds from our sale of new notes and warrants in august and million in net proceeds from a term loan  discussed below 
principal payments in on long term debt consisted primarily of the prepayment of a million term loan and our million subordinated convertible notes  which were due in  and million of principal payments on capital leases and other debt 
we received million in from the issuance of shares of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options and warrants 
our financing activities used million and million of cash in and  respectively 
during  we repaid our prior primary credit facility using cash proceeds from the sales of businesses as required under the terms of that credit facility 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under that facility  which was formally terminated in january the primary use of cash for financing activities during was for repayments of our then primary credit facility and the repayment of an advance from a joint venture partner 
on march   we entered into a three year credit facility with foothill capital corporation foothill as arranger and agent 
the facility provided for total borrowings of up to million  including i a million term loan the term loan and ii a million revolver the revolver  of which up to million could be available for borrowing based on our billed and unbilled receivables 
the term loan had an interest rate equal to the prime rate publicly announced from time to time by wells fargo bank  national association the prime rate plus  but not less than 
borrowings under the revolver accrue interest at a rate equal to the prime rate plus  but not less than 
upon closing the facility  we borrowed the entire million available under the term loan  which provided million in net proceeds after deducting transaction fees and expenses 
we prepaid the entire term loan in august using proceeds from our august million financing discussed below 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the revolver  although approximately million of the amount available for borrowing was reserved under letters of credit  foreign exchange forward contracts or other arrangements 
accordingly  million of the revolver was available for borrowing as of december  the borrowings under the facility are collateralized by all of our assets 
on august   we raised gross proceeds of million through the sale of  units  each consisting of  aggregate principal amount of our second priority secured notes due the notes and one warrant to purchase up to shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we used the million net proceeds from the offering  together with available cash  to prepay the million term loan and to repay our million subordinated convertible notes due interest on the notes is payable semi annually each february and august the notes are subordinated in right of payment to our existing and future senior indebtedness  including indebtedness under our million revolver described above 
both the revolver and the indenture governing the notes the indenture contain covenants limiting our ability to  among other things  incur more debt  redeem or repurchase orbital stock  enter into transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with others  dispose of assets or create liens on assets 
the revolver contains an absolute prohibition on the payment of cash dividends 
the indenture prohibits the payment of cash dividends if  after such payment  we could not incur additional indebtedness pursuant to a debt incurrence ratio defined in the indenture or  if the aggregate amount of cash dividends  along with other restricted payments  were to exceed of our aggregate consolidated net income for the period plus net cash proceeds received from issuances of stock 
in addition  the revolver contains financial covenants with respect to maintenance of earnings before interest expense  tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda  backlog  capital expenditures and available cash 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the revolver and the indenture 
orbital s owned subsidiary  orbital international  inc  has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes 
orbital international  inc had no independent assets or operations during the three years ended december  no other subsidiary of orbital has guaranteed the notes 
available cash and future funding at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
management believes that available cash  cash expected to be generated from operations and borrowing capacity under the revolver will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital expenditure requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
our ability to borrow additional funds is limited by the terms of our outstanding debt 
additionally  significant unforeseen events such as termination of major orders  or late delivery or failure of launch vehicle or satellite products could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
debt and lease maturities the following summarizes orbital s obligations associated with debt and leases at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions time to maturity five one year two to years and total or less four years beyond debt operating leases capital leases total assumes our second priority secured notes are paid at full par value in letters of credit and performance bonds occasionally  certain contracts require us to post performance bonds or letters of credit supporting our performance and refund obligations under the contracts 
we had million of standby letters of credit outstanding at december   of which million was collateralized by our restricted cash and cash equivalents and million was issued under the revolver 
if circumstances were to prevail in the future whereby we were unable to issue performance bonds or letters of credit in accordance with our contractual requirements  the customer might be entitled to withhold future payments or terminate its contract with us and this could result in charges or other adverse effects on our financial condition
