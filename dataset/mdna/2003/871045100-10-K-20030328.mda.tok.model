see forward looking statements 
overview beginning in february when we commenced operations  we derived our revenue principally from the sale of banner and site sponsorship advertising 
we now primarily derive revenue from our merchant network 
net merchant network revenue includes revenue from various licensing agreements with our merchant network alliance partners 
these agreements involve engineering work to develop a web hosted platform for our merchant network alliance partners which looks and feels like the merchant network alliance partner s own web site and includes our searching functionality and a per merchant fee per month in the form of a fixed fee per merchant or a percentage of revenue based upon the number of merchants they promote in the platform 
net merchant network revenue also includes revenue from activities in which we run trademark and display ads in the switchboard 
com yellow pages directory  build and host web sites for local merchants and send related direct electronic mail based promotions 
in addition  included as an offset to merchant network revenue is consideration given to customers  for which the benefits of such consideration are not separately identifiable from the revenue obtained from those customers 
during the year ended december   approximately of our net revenue was derived from our local merchant network 
our largest and most significant merchant network alliance partner is america online  inc under our amended agreement with aol  which expires in december  we paid aol million  issued  shares of our common stock and will share directory advertisement revenue with aol 
we account for consideration provided to aol as an offset to revenue 
in addition aol committed to pay us at least million in consulting or service fees over the term of the agreement 
in and  consulting and service fees totaled million and million  respectively 
revenue recognized from aol  net of amortization of consideration given to aol  was million  or of net revenue  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there was no revenue from aol in the year ended december  we anticipate that aol will continue to represent a significant percentage of our revenue in and will be a material component of our overall business 
we also generate revenue from the sale of national advertising and site sponsorship revenue on white and yellow pages  as well as maps pages  across both switchboard 
com and the switchboard alliance partner network 
such revenue is derived from banner advertisements  sponsorships  direct electronic mail based promotions and other forms of national advertising that are sold on either a fixed fee  cost per thousand impressions or cost per action basis 
during the year ended december   approximately of our net revenue was derived from the sale of national advertising and site sponsorships 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses paid to third parties under data licensing and web site creation and hosting agreements  as well as other direct expenses incurred to maintain the operations of our web site as well as the web hosted platforms of our merchant network alliance partners 
these direct expenses consist of data communications expenses related to internet connectivity charges  salaries and benefits for operations personnel  equipment costs and related depreciation  costs of running our data centers  which include rent and utilities  and a pro rata share of occupancy and information system expenses 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue has varied in the past  primarily as a result of the amount of revenue recognized in the period being spread over relatively fixed cost of revenue 
our sales and marketing expense consists primarily of employee salaries and benefits  costs associated with channel marketing programs  collateral production expenses  promotional advertising  third party commission costs  advertising and creative production expenses  public relations  market research  provision for bad debts and a pro rata share of occupancy and information system expenses 
a significant portion of our web site promotion costs in prior years resulted from non cash advertising expenses under an advertising and promotion agreement that terminated in october our research and development expense consists primarily of employee salaries and benefits  fees for outside consultants and related costs associated with the development of new services and features on our web hosted directory platform  the enhancement of existing products  quality assurance  testing  documentation and a portion of occupancy and information system expenses based on employee headcount 
our general and administrative expense consists primarily of employee salaries and benefits and other personnel related costs for executive and financial personnel  as well as legal expenses  directors and officers insurance and accounting costs  and a portion of occupancy and information system expenses based on employee headcount 
our amortization of goodwill  intangibles and other assets consists primarily of amortization of goodwill resulting from our acquisition of envenue  inc in november and the amortization of other long term assets 
we have experienced substantial net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these net losses and accumulated deficit resulted from insufficient revenue to cover the significant costs incurred in the development of our web hosted directory platform and the establishment of our corporate infrastructure and organization 
to date  we have made no provision for income taxes 
adoption of eitf effective january  we adopted emerging issues task force issue accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products eitf  which became effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have concluded that eitf is applicable to the accounting for our directory and local advertising platform services agreement with aol directory agreement  as the benefits received from consideration given to aol are not sufficiently separable from the revenue derived from aol 
our and results have been adjusted to conform to the presentation required by eitf accordingly  we have decreased our merchant network revenue by million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and reduced our operating expenses by corresponding amounts for the same periods 
the adoption of eitf had no effect on net income or our capital resources 
the following table illustrates the effect of the application of eitf year ended december  gross revenue    less amortization of consideration given to aol   net revenue    operating expenses    less amortization of consideration given to aol   net operating expenses    significant relationship in december  we entered into a directory agreement with aol to develop a new directory and local advertising platform and product set to be featured across specified aol properties the directory platform 
in november  april  august and november  certain terms of the agreement were amended 
under the four year term of the amended directory agreement  we share with aol specified directory advertisement revenue 
in general  we receive a majority of the first million of such directory advertisement revenue and a lesser share of any additional directory advertisement revenue pursuant to the august amendment 
we paid aol and recorded an asset of million at the signing of the directory agreement 
following the incorporation of the directory platform on the aol 
com  aol service and digital city properties aol roll in in january  we recorded a second asset and a liability related to future payments of million 
in april  we established an additional asset and liability of million and paid million upon the execution of the april amendment 
under the april amended agreement  we were scheduled to make six additional quarterly payments of million each  replacing the million originally owed upon the aol roll in 
the august amendment  among other things  eliminated the million in remaining additional payments established in the april amendment 
aol committed to pay us at least million in consulting or service fees over the term of the directory agreement under a payment schedule which ended in september  of which aol has paid all million and we have delivered all million in services to aol 
in addition  we are required to provide up to hours of engineering services per month to aol at no charge  if requested by aol for the term of the agreement 
these hours are provided to support the directory platform  from which we share in directory advertising revenue over the term of the amended agreement 
any engineering services provided by us in excess of hours per month are charged to aol on a time and materials basis 
aol typically exceeds these hours each month 
in and  consulting and service fees totaled million and million  respectively 
the term of the august amended directory agreement expires in december  and is subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of specified events  including  without limitation switchboard being acquired by one of certain third parties  or aol acquiring one of certain third parties and aol pays us a termination fee of million 
in connection with entering into the directory agreement  in december  we issued to aol  shares of our common stock  which were restricted from transfer until the aol roll in  which occurred on january  we also agreed to issue to aol an additional  shares of common stock if the directory agreement continued after two years and a further  shares of common stock if the directory agreement continued after three years 
under the amended agreement  the requirement to issue additional shares upon the two and three year continuations has been eliminated 
if we renew the directory agreement with aol for at least an additional four years after the initial term  we agreed to issue to aol a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at a per share purchase price of 
the million paid and value of the stock issued upon the signing of the directory agreement was amortized on a straight line basis over the original four year estimated life of the agreement 
as of december  the remaining unamortized amounts of million were written down to zero as a result of an impairment analysis as of december  in  we recorded amortization based upon the remaining net book value of our aol assets established upon the aol roll in and april amendment on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the amended agreement 
as a result of the elimination in the august amendment of the remaining million owed to aol  an adjustment to amortization of consideration given to a customer of  was recorded in  offsetting amortization recorded in the period 
throughout the remaining initial term of the amended agreement  we will no longer record amortization of consideration given to aol as these assets are now fully amortized and no further consideration is due aol 
amortization of assets related to aol has been reflected as a reduction of revenue in accordance with eitf revenue recognized from aol  net of amortization of consideration given to aol  was million  or of net revenue  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net amounts due from aol included in accounts receivable at december  and were  and  respectively 
unbilled receivables related to aol at december  were  as of december   aol beneficially owned of our outstanding common stock 
results of operations the following table presents certain consolidated statement of operations information stated as a percentage of total net revenue change to to net revenue merchant network national advertising total net revenue cost of revenue gross profit sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of goodwill  intangibles and other assets loss on viacom transaction n a special credits charges n a total operating expenses operating loss other income expense net loss revenue total net revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  from to  and a decrease of million  or  from to the increase in net revenue in consisted primarily of an increase in net merchant network revenue  offset in part by a decrease in national advertising and site sponsorship revenue 
the decrease in net revenue in when compared to consisted primarily of decreases in national advertising revenue and net merchant network revenue 
net merchant network revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  from to  and a decrease of million  or  from to the increase in net merchant network revenue in was primarily due a reduction in amortization of consideration given to aol of million as a result of the elimination of such amortization in august upon the amendment to the directory agreement with aol 
the increase in was also attributable to increases in merchant licensing revenues from aol as well as our other merchant network alliance partners  increased membership in our merchant network and revenue attributable to additional services offered to existing local merchants 
the decrease in net merchant network revenue from to was due primarily to an increase of million in amortization of consideration given to aol associated with the directory agreement  offset in part by an increase in revenue from licensing revenue from aol as well as new licensing agreements with other merchant network alliance partners  increased membership in our merchant network and revenue attributable to additional services offered to existing local merchants 
national advertising and site sponsorship revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or  from to  and a decrease of million  or  from to the decreases in national advertising and site sponsorship revenue in and resulted from a decrease in both the number of advertisers on the site  as well as the per impression fee charged to those customers 
we attribute these decreases to a decline in demand for internet advertising services as well as the overall state of the us economy 
we do not anticipate substantial additional declines in in the demand for internet advertising 
we expect that national advertising and site sponsorship revenue will be relatively flat in when compared to there was no revenue in generated from concurrent transactions  in which we received promotion or marketing assets in exchange for promotion on our web site and inclusion in e mail distributions to our user base 
revenue from concurrent transactions was and of net revenue in and  respectively 
in the year ended december   aol accounted for of net revenue 
we do not expect to incur revenue from concurrent transactions in in the year ended december   one customer accounted for of net revenue 
in the year ended december   one customer accounted for of net revenue 
cost of revenue cost of revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cost of revenue increased  or  in and remained relatively flat in  when compared to in  we incurred an increase of  in depreciation associated with additional equipment necessary to support our web site and those of our merchant network alliance partners  an increase of  in the cost of third party data  and an increase in revenue from lower margin merchant network services 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease of  in third party web site creation and hosting expenses associated with our merchant programs and a decrease of  in equipment related expenses incurred to support our local merchant network alliance partners 
in  we incurred increases of  in salaries and benefits and  in equipment related expense to support our local merchant network alliance partners 
these increases were offset in part by decreases of  in web site creation and hosting fees in connection with our merchant services programs and amortization of deferred project costs 
gross profit gross profit in was of net revenue  or million  compared with of net revenue  or million 
in and  or million  in the increase in gross profit dollars and percentage in was primarily due to an increase in net revenue being spread over relatively fixed costs of revenue  offset in part by an increase in lower margin merchant network services revenue 
the decrease in gross profit dollars and percentage in was primarily due to relatively fixed costs of revenue being spread over decreased revenue  as well as a decrease in higher margin national advertising revenue as a percentage of total net revenue 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or  from to  and a decrease of million  or  from to the decrease in was primarily related to the elimination of the non cash advertising expense related to our former agreement with viacom  which accounted for million and million of our sales and marketing expense during and  respectively 
the decrease in was also attributable to decreases of million in other corporate marketing program expenses  million in employee salaries and benefits resulting primarily from actions taken during our corporate restructuring activities in the three months ended december    in provisions for doubtful accounts  and  in merchant program expenses 
the decrease in was due primarily to decreases of million in merchant services program expenses and million in cbs advertising  offset in part by increases of  in other advertising expenses   in provision for doubtful accounts   in employee salaries and benefits and  in costs associated with additional leased facilities 
research and development research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or  from to  and an increase of million  or  from to the decrease in was due primarily to decreases of  in outside consulting   in employee salaries and benefits   in costs associated with leased facilities and  in recruiting expenses 
the increase in was due primarily to increases of million in salaries and benefits associated with new personnel resulting primarily from our acquisition of envenue   in depreciation   in outside consulting expenses  and  in costs associated with additional leased facilities  offset in part by an increase of  in the capitalization of deferred project costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or  from to  and an increase of  or  from to the decrease in was primarily due to a decrease of  in salaries and benefits resulting primarily from actions taken during our corporate restructuring activities in the three months ended december  and a decrease of  in costs associated with leased facilities  offset in part by an increase of  in expenses for professional services incurred primarily as a result of amendments to our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended march  and the restatement of the financial statements included therein 
the increase in was due primarily to increases of  in professional services   in insurance expenses   in salaries and benefits associated with new personnel and  in depreciation 
amortization of goodwill  intangibles and other assets amortization of goodwill  intangibles and other assets was none   and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or  from to  and  or  from to the decrease in resulted primarily from the absence in of amortization of goodwill resulting from our acquisition of envenue  which was written down to zero as of december as a result of an impairment analysis  and amortization expense associated with a software license  which was fully amortized as of december the decrease in resulted primarily from the absence in of amortization of the value of warrants issued in connection with a co branded web site and linking agreement  and a reduction in amortization expense associated with a software license  offset in part by an increase in amortization of goodwill resulting from our purchase of envenue in november loss on viacom transaction as a result of our october restructuring of our relationship with viacom  we reported a one time  non cash accounting loss of million in related to the termination of our advertising and promotion agreement with viacom 
we agreed to terminate our right to the placement of advertising on viacom s cbs properties with an expected net present value of approximately million in exchange for  primarily  the reconveyance by viacom to us of approximately million shares of our common stock  the cancellation of warrants held by viacom to purchase  shares of our common stock and the reconveyance to us of the one outstanding share of our series e special voting preferred stock 
the non cash accounting loss of million results from the difference between the net present value of our remaining advertising rights with viacom  which were terminated  and the value of the shares of our common and preferred stock that were reconveyed and the warrants that were cancelled 
special credits charges in the three months ended december   we recorded the reversal of  in excess restructuring reserves as a special credit 
this reversal resulted primarily from better than expected experience in the subleasing of idle office space for which we had reserved as part of our special charges 
in december  we recorded net pre tax special charges of approximately million  comprised primarily of million for the impairment of certain assets  million for costs related to facility closures and  in severance costs related to the reduction of approximately of our workforce 
the restructuring resulted in employee separations 
these facility closures and employee separation activities were substantially completed during included in the million impairment charge for certain assets is an amount recorded for the impairment of the unamortized portion of the value of the common stock issued and amounts prepaid to aol 
we assessed the value of our assets related to our aol directory agreement for impairment as revenues were lower at the end of the first year of the directory agreement than originally anticipated 
based upon impairment analysis which indicated that the carrying amount of these assets would not be fully recovered through estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows  a charge of million was recorded as an additional component of special charges during the impairment was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded the present value of the estimated discounted future cash flows attributable to these assets 
in december  we exercised our rights under the envenue acquisition agreement to substantially reduce the funding of envenue 
we evaluated the carrying value of our goodwill in envenue  and determined it would not be fully recovered through estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows 
as a result during the three months ending december   we recorded as a component of the million impairment charge for certain assets an impairment charge of million related to the envenue goodwill 
the impairment was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded the present value of the estimated discounted future cash flows attributable to these assets 
also included in the impairment charge for certain assets are amounts related to prepaid advertising expenses 
as a result of our change in overall strategy from a destination site to a technology provider  we no longer consider this prepaid advertising to be complementary to our corporate strategy 
accordingly  we have recorded million for the impairment of these prepaid advertising assets 
of the total million facilities and severance charge  which is net of the  special credit recorded in  we currently estimate that million is cash related 
as of december   million of the original million accrual had been utilized 
we have a remaining liability of  on our balance sheet as of december  relating to the special charges 
other income other income was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or  from to  and a decrease of  or  from to the decrease in was due primarily to a decrease in interest income earned as a result of reduced funds available for investment and a decline in interest rates  and an increase in interest expense incurred as a result of our financing of equipment purchases made during and  offset in part by a loss on disposal of fixed assets in the decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in interest income due to lower available funds for investment  offset in part by a decrease in unrealized losses on an investment 
net loss our net loss decreased to million in  from million in and million in as of december   our accumulated deficit totaled million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had total cash and marketable securities of million  consisting of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of restricted cash  million of short term marketable securities and million of long term marketable securities 
during  cash increased by million  primarily due to cash provided by investing activities of million as we moved certain of our investments to more liquid cash equivalents  offset in part by net cash used for operating activities of million 
net cash used for operating activities for was million  primarily due to a net loss of million  million paid under the directory agreement with aol  a decrease in accounts payable of million and a decrease in accrued restructuring expense of  offset in part by depreciation and amortization of million  as well as various other cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by investing activities for was million 
investing activities for the period were primarily related to net sales of marketable securities of million  purchases of property and equipment of  and an increase in restricted cash of  net cash provided by financing activities for was  primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of notes payable of million related to the financing of equipment purchases and proceeds of  from the issuance of stock  offset in part by the purchase of million in treasury stock  and payments of capital leases and notes payable of million 
in february  viacom inc exercised its warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock pursuant to a cashless exercise provision in the warrant  resulting in the net issuance of  shares of common stock 
in march  we repurchased the  shares of our common stock from viacom at per share 
the repurchased shares are being held as treasury stock 
in may  we paid  to fleet capital corporation to terminate our lease obligations with fleet capital corporation through an early buy out 
in exchange for the amount paid  we assumed all right and title to the assets leased under the facility 
additionally  our requirement to maintain a compensating balance with fleet national bank fleet was eliminated 
in june  we entered into a loan and security agreement the svb financing agreement with silicon valley bank svb  under which we have the ability to borrow up to million for the purchase of equipment 
amounts borrowed under the facility accrue interest at a rate equal to prime plus  and are repaid monthly over a month period 
as of december   we had utilized million of this facility 
the facility provided for the ability to fund additional equipment purchases of up to million through march  we did not utilize the facility in the three months ended march  to fund additional equipment purchases 
the agreement also provides for a million revolving line of credit 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
as a condition of the svb financing agreement  we are required to maintain in deposit or investment accounts at svb not less than of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
additionally  covenants in the agreement require us to maintain in deposit or in investment accounts with svb at least million in unrestricted cash 
as part of the transition to svb  we liquidated million in marketable securities previously held at fleet for transfer to svb 
as a result of this liquidation  we recorded  in realized gains during these amounts have been transferred to svb 
in november  we acquired envenue  inc  a wireless provider of advanced product searching technologies designed to drive leads to traditional retailers 
the total purchase price included consideration of million in cash to be paid on or before may  we have not paid this amount  as we are in a contractual dispute with the previous owners of envenue 
in june  we placed into escrow million  which will be held in escrow until the contractual dispute is resolved 
we have recorded this amount as restricted cash 
in october  we paid  representing the undisputed portion of the purchase price plus interest from the original maturity date to the former stockholders of envenue 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than year years total envenue note payable   operating lease obligations a  other long term obligations b    total    a excludes our operating lease for our principal administrative  sales and marketing  and research and development facility located in westboro  massachusetts 
on december   our lease for this space expired 
subsequently  effective january  we entered into a new one year lease  which will expire on december  under the new lease  we are required to pay epresence a base rent of approximately  during b consists of scheduled principal payments on our silicon valley bank financing agreement 
since our inception  we have significantly increased our operating expenses 
we anticipate that our operating expenses and capital expenditures will constitute a material use of our cash resources into the foreseeable future 
we expect that we may need to incur advertising expense in future periods  which will require us to spend cash in order to continue to brand our name and increase traffic to our web site 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in businesses  technologies  products or services that are strategic or complementary to our business 
we believe that the cash and marketable securities currently available will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements to fund operations for at least the next months 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to the understanding of our results of operations 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  compensation expenses  third party commissions  restructuring costs  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
critical accounting polices are those policies that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we generate our revenue primarily from our merchant network and banner and site sponsorship advertising 
generally  revenue is recognized as services are provided  so long as no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we believe that we are able to make reliable judgments regarding the creditworthiness of our customers based upon historical and current information available to us 
there can be no assurances that our payment experience with our customers will be consistent with past experience or that the financial condition of these customers will not decline in future periods  the result of which could be our failure to collect invoiced amounts 
some of these amounts could be material  resulting in an increase in our provision for bad debts 
in addition to bad debts arising from the any failure to collect monies due from our customers for products and services delivered  under the directory agreement we share a portion of bad debts incurred by aol 
the royalty we receive from aol is primarily based upon revenue recognized by aol in the period  less any commissions paid on such revenue and any amounts written off by aol as bad debt 
based upon aol s historical bad debt experience  we have established and maintained a sales allowance to reserve for our estimate of our portion of aol s future bad debts associated with revenue recognized during the period 
aol s collection experience with their customers may be inconsistent with its past experience 
aol decides to consider certain of their receivables as bad debt at their own discretion 
as a result  should aol s bad debts exceed our estimates  we will be required to further reduce our revenue for our share of amounts considered uncollectable by aol 
these amounts could be material and have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
risks  concentrations and uncertainties we invest our cash and cash equivalents primarily in deposits  money market funds and investment grade securities with financial institutions 
we have not experienced any material realized losses to date on our invested cash 
a potential exposure is a concentration of credit risk in accounts receivable 
we maintain reserves for credit losses and  to date  such losses have been within our expectations 
these expectations are based on historical experience  analysis of information currently available to us with respect to our customer s financial position  as well as various other factors 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates of these matters  it is possible that these estimates may change in the near future due  for example  to changes in market conditions  other economic factors or issues specific to individual customers 
a change in estimates could negatively affect our results of operations 
accounting for stock based compensation in january  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee comensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in annual financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas is effective for us for the year ended december  we have determined that we will continue to account for stock based compensation for employees under apb  and elect the disclosure only alternative under sfas and provide the enhanced disclosures as required by sfas we are required in the preparation of the disclosures required under sfas to make certain estimates when ascribing a value to stock options granted during the year 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  an estimate of the average time option grants will be outstanding before they are ultimately exercised and converted into common stock and an estimate of the future volatility in the market value of our common stock over that period in which the option grants are outstanding 
these estimates are integral to the valuing of these option grants 
any changes in these estimates may have a material effect on the value ascribed to these option grants 
this would in turn affect the amortization used in the disclosures we make under sfas  which could be material 
further  the rules governing accounting for option grants continue to evolve 
should we be required in future periods to include amortization of stock options  such amortization would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the eitf issued issue no 
income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred eitf  relating to the accounting for reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses 
in accordance with eitf  reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred should be characterized as revenue in the statement of operations 
eitf is effective for all financial reporting periods beginning after december  and upon adoption  there is a requirement to present comparative prior period financial information 
the adoption of eitf did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas is effective for switchboard on january  sfas creates a model whereby a liability is recognized at its fair value in the period in which it is incurred  rather than at the date of commitment to a plan 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others fin 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  and the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin to clarify the conditions under which assets  liabilities and activities of another entity should be consolidated into the financial statements of a company 
fin requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity by a company that bears the majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities  is entitled to receive a majority of the variable interest entity s residual returns  or both 
the provisions of fin  required to be adopted in fiscal  are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the eitf finalized its consensus on eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  which provides guidance on the timing and method of revenue recognition for sales arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
eitf is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  under eitf  revenue must be allocated to all deliverables regardless of whether an individual element is incidental or perfunctory 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
factors affecting operating results  business prospects and market price of stock we caution you that the following important factors  among others  in the future could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of switchboard in filings with the securities and exchange commission  press releases  communications with investors  and oral statements 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this annual report on form k and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed 
actual future results may vary materially 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
risks related to our business we have a history of incurring net losses  we expect our net losses to continue for at least the next quarter  if not the next several quarters  and we may never achieve profitability we have incurred significant net losses in each fiscal quarter since our inception 
from inception to december   we have incurred net losses totaling million 
as a result  we need to generate additional revenue to fund our operations 
it is possible that we may never achieve profitability and  even if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
if we do not achieve sustained profitability  we will eventually be unable to continue our operations 
if the directory services agreement we entered into with america online  inc 
aol  a subsidiary of aol time warner  inc  is not successful  it would have a materially negative effect on our results of operations the directory agreement we entered into with aol may not generate anticipated revenues or other benefits 
even though we have recently amended the agreement  the agreement may still be prematurely terminated by breach or it otherwise fails to be successful 
our revenue from aol in recent quarters has been lower than anticipated  due to aol s longer than expected transition to a third party channel sales model in its directory advertising business  and it is possible that this and other factors may lead to revenue from aol being lower than anticipated in future periods as well 
local merchants may not view the alliance as an effective advertising vehicle for their products and services 
even if the directory agreement is not successful  aol may not have to return any of the consideration  including cash and stock  which we have paid to aol  and we may have continuing contractual obligations to aol under the agreement 
in  revenue derived from aol represented a significant portion of our net revenue 
aol accounted for of total net revenue in we anticipate that aol will represent greater than of our net revenue during and will be a material component of our overall business 
the termination of our agreement with aol or the failure of our agreement with aol to generate these anticipated revenues would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the term of our agreement with aol expires in december we or aol may elect not to renew the agreement upon its expiration 
our quarterly results of operations are likely to fluctuate and  as a result  we may fail to meet the expectations of our investors and securities analysts  which may cause the price of our common stock to decline our quarterly revenue and results of operations are volatile and are particularly difficult to predict 
our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future 
we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are necessarily meaningful and you should not rely upon these comparisons as indicators of our future performance 
factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate include the addition  loss or success of relationships with third parties that are our source of new merchants or that license our software  the amount and timing of expenditures for expansion of our operations  including the hiring of new employees  capital expenditures and related costs  technical difficulties or failures affecting our systems or the internet in general  the cost of acquiring  and the availability of  content  including directory information and maps  and the fact that our expenses are only partially based on our expectations regarding future revenue and are largely fixed in nature  particularly in the short term 
as a result of these or other factors  results in any future quarter may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if so  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 
we depend on merchant network alliance partnerships with third parties to grow our business and our business may not grow if the merchant network alliance partnerships upon which we depend fail to produce the expected benefits or are terminated our business depends upon our ability to maintain and benefit from our existing merchant network alliance partnerships and to establish additional merchant network alliance partnerships 
for our business to be successful  we must expand our merchant network and generate significant revenue from that initiative 
the success of our merchant network depends in substantial part upon our ability to access a broad base of local merchants 
the merchant base is highly fragmented 
local merchants are difficult to contact efficiently and cost effectively 
consequently  we depend on relationships with merchant network alliance partners to sell internet yellow pages advertising in our merchant network to local merchants and to provide billing and other administrative services relating to our merchant services 
the termination of any strategic relationship with a merchant network alliance partner would significantly impair our ability to attract potential local merchant customers and deliver our merchant services to our current customers 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop or maintain relationships with new merchant network alliance partners on terms acceptable to us or at all 
in addition to our relationship with aol  we have entered into relationships with merchant network alliance partners and third party content providers 
these parties may not perform their contractual obligations to us and  if they do not  we may not be able to require them to do so 
some of our strategic customer and supplier relationships may be terminated by either party on short notice 
our strategic customer and supplier relationships are in early stages of development 
these relationships may not provide us benefits that outweigh the costs of the relationships 
if any strategic customer or supplier demands a greater portion of revenue or requires us to make payments for access to its web site  we may need to terminate or refuse to renew that relationship  even if it had been previously profitable or otherwise beneficial 
in addition  if we lose a significant strategic partner  we may be unable to replace that relationship with other strategic relationships with comparable revenue potential  content or user demographics 
if we cannot demonstrate the value of our merchant services to local merchants enrolled to receive our services through our merchant network alliance partners  those local merchant customers may stop using these services  which could reduce our revenue we may be unable to demonstrate the value of our merchant services to local merchants enrolled to receive our services through our merchant network alliance partners 
if local merchants cancel our various services  which are generally provided on a month to month basis  our revenue could decline and we may need to incur additional expenditures to obtain new local merchant customers 
we do not presently provide data demonstrating the number of leads generated by our merchant services 
regardless of whether our merchant services effectively produce leads  our local merchant customers may not know the source of the leads and may cancel our merchant services 
the attractiveness of our services could diminish if we are not able to license accurate database information from third party content providers we principally rely upon single third party sources to provide us with our business and residential listings data and mapping data 
the loss of any one of these sources or the inability of any of these sources to collect their data could significantly and adversely affect our ability to provide information to consumers 
although other sources of database information exist  we may not be able to integrate data from these sources into our database systems in a timely  cost effective manner  or without an inordinate disruption of internal engineering resources 
other sources of data may not be offered on terms acceptable to us 
moreover  a consolidation by internet related businesses could reduce the number of content providers with which we could form relationships 
we typically license information under arrangements that require us to pay royalties or other fees for the use of the content 
in the future  some of our content providers may demand a greater portion of advertising revenue or increase the fees that they charge us for their content 
if we fail to enter into and maintain satisfactory arrangements with existing or substitute content providers  we may be unable to continue to provide our services 
the success of our business depends on the quality of our services and that quality is substantially dependent on the accuracy of data we license from third parties 
any failure to maintain accurate data could impair the reputation of our brand and our services  reduce the volume of users attracted to our web site as well as the web sites of our merchant network alliance partners  and diminish the attractiveness of our service offerings to those merchant network alliance partners  advertisers and content providers 
epresence s majority ownership interest in us will permit epresence to control matters submitted for approval of our stockholders  which could delay or prevent a change in control or depress our stock price as of december   epresence beneficially owned approximately of our common stock 
based upon this majority interest in us  epresence is generally able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval and our management and affairs  including the election and removal of directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
presently  three of the six members of our board of directors are officers or directors of epresence 
epresence s control over us could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of switchboard that other stockholders may believe would result in a more optimal return on investment 
in addition  this control could depress our stock price because purchasers will not be able to acquire a controlling interest in us 
epresence may elect to sell all or a substantial portion of its capital stock to one or more third parties  in which case a third party with whom we have no prior relationship could exercise the same degree of control over us as epresence presently does 
we rely on a small number of customers  the loss of whom may substantially reduce our revenue we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number customers 
during  net revenue derived from our top ten customers accounted for approximately of our total net revenue 
additionally  net revenue derived from aol alone accounted for of our total net revenue in consequently  our revenue may substantially decline if we lose any of these customers 
we anticipate that our future results of operations will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenue from a small number of customers 
in addition  we anticipate that the identity of those customers will change over time 
if we do not introduce new or enhanced offerings to our merchant network alliance partners  we may be unable to attract and retain those merchant network alliance partners  which would significantly impede our ability to generate revenue we need to introduce new or enhanced products and services to attract and retain merchant network alliance partners  and remain competitive 
our industry has been characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences and frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies 
these changes could render our technology  systems and web site obsolete 
if we do not periodically enhance our existing products and services  develop new technologies that address sophisticated and varied consumer needs  respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis and address evolving customer preferences  our products and services may not be attractive to merchant network alliance partners  which would significantly impede our revenue growth 
in addition  if any new product or service introduction  such as the switchboard matrix system with enhanced search capabilities  is not favorably received  our reputation and our brand could be damaged 
we may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent us from introducing new products and services 
our business may suffer if we lose the services of our chief executive officer or founder our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and effective working relationships of our senior management and other key personnel  including  but not limited to  douglas greenlaw  our chief executive officer  and dean polnerow  our founder and president 
our business may suffer if we lose the services of mr 
greenlaw  mr 
polnerow or other key personnel 
if we are not able to attract and retain highly skilled managerial and technical personnel with internet experience  we may not be able to implement our business model successfully we believe that our management must be able to act decisively to apply and adapt our business model in the rapidly changing internet markets in which we compete 
in addition  we rely upon our technical employees to develop and maintain much of the technology used to provide our products and services 
consequently  we believe that our success depends largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial and technical personnel 
we may not be able to hire or retain the necessary personnel to implement our business strategy 
in addition  we may need to pay higher compensation to employees than we currently expect 
the markets for internet content  services and advertising are highly competitive  and our failure to compete successfully will limit our ability to increase or retain our market share our failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position would limit our ability to increase or maintain our market share  which would seriously harm our business 
we compete in the markets for internet content  services and advertising 
these markets are new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
we expect this competition to intensify in the future 
we compete  or expect to compete  with many providers of internet content  information services and products  as well as with traditional media  for audience attention and advertising and sponsorship revenue 
we license much of our database content under non exclusive agreements with third party providers which are in the business of licensing their content to many businesses  including our current and potential competitors 
many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater financial  infrastructure and personnel resources than we have 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established  large  and experienced sales and marketing capabilities and greater name recognition than we have 
as a result  our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also develop and promote their products and services more effectively than we do 
moreover  barriers to entry are not significant  and current and new competitors may be able to launch new web sites at a relatively low cost 
we therefore expect additional competitors to enter these markets 
many of our current customers have established relationships with our current and potential competitors 
if our competitors develop content that is superior to ours or that achieves greater market acceptance than ours  we may not be able to develop alternative content in a timely  cost effective manner  or at all  and we may lose market share 
we may not be able to dedicate the substantial resources required to expand  monitor and maintain our internally developed systems without contracting with an outside supplier at substantial expense we will have to expand and upgrade our technology  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure if the volume of traffic on our web site or our merchant network alliance partners web sites increases substantially 
we could experience temporary capacity constraints that may cause unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times and lower levels of customer service 
we may not be able to project accurately the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our services or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate these increases in a timely manner 
our inability to upgrade and expand as required could impair the reputation of our brand and our services  reduce the volume of users able to access our web site  and diminish the attractiveness of our service offerings to our strategic partners  advertisers and content providers 
because we developed these systems internally  we must either dedicate substantial internal resources to monitor  maintain and upgrade these systems or contract with an outside supplier for these services at substantial expense 
we have limited experience acquiring companies  and any acquisitions we undertake could limit our ability to manage and maintain our business  result in adverse accounting treatment and be difficult to integrate into our business we have limited experience in acquiring businesses and have very limited experience in acquiring complementary technologies 
in may  we acquired mapsonus  and in november  we acquired envenue 
in the future we may undertake additional acquisitions 
acquisitions  in general  involve numerous risks  including diversion of our management s attention  future impairment of substantial goodwill  adversely affecting our reported results of operations  inability to retain the management  key personnel and other employees of the acquired business  inability to assimilate the operations  products  technologies and information systems of the acquired business with our business  and inability to retain the acquired company s customers  affiliates  content providers  advertisers and key personnel 
our internally developed software may contain undetected errors  which could limit our ability to provide our products and services and diminish the attractiveness of our service offerings we use internally developed  custom software to provide our products and services 
this software may contain undetected errors  defects or bugs 
although we have not suffered significant harm from any errors or defects to date  we may discover significant errors or defects in the future that we may not be able to fix 
our inability to fix any of those errors could limit our ability to provide our services  impair the reputation of our brand and our services  reduce the volume of users who visit our web site and diminish the attractiveness of our service offerings to our strategic partners  advertisers and content providers 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our technology and information may be used by others to compete against us we depend upon our internally developed and other proprietary technology 
if we do not effectively protect our proprietary technology  others may become able to use it to compete against us 
to protect our proprietary rights  we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  patents  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties and protective contractual provisions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may misappropriate our proprietary technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
we may not be able to detect these or any other unauthorized uses of our intellectual property or take appropriate steps to enforce our proprietary rights 
in addition  others could independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property 
if our services infringe on intellectual property rights of others  we may be required to expend substantial resources to reengineer our services and to incur substantial costs and damages related to infringement claims we are subject to the risk of claims alleging infringement of third party proprietary rights 
if we are subject to claims of infringement of  or are infringing on  the rights of third parties  we may not be able to obtain licenses to use those rights on commercially reasonable terms 
in that event  we may need to undertake substantial reengineering to continue our service offerings 
any effort to undertake such reengineering might not be successful 
in addition  any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract our management 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from providing our services 
risks related to the internet if the acceptance and effectiveness of internet advertising does not become fully established  the growth of our yellow pages and banner and site sponsorship advertising revenue will suffer our business model is heavily dependent upon increasing our sales  ultimately through our merchant network alliance partners  of yellow pages advertising to local merchants 
if use of internet yellow pages by consumers does not increase  internet yellow pages advertising will not become more attractive to merchants and our yellow pages advertising revenue growth will suffer 
similarly  if internet banner and site sponsorship advertising fails to gain wide acceptance and to grow from year to year  our banner and site sponsorship revenue will be affected 
even though we anticipate that revenue from banner and site sponsorship advertisements will decline as a percentage of our future revenue  our future success still depends  in part  on an increase in the use of the internet as an advertising medium 
we generated  and of our net revenue from the sale of banner and site sponsorship advertisements during  and  respectively 
the internet advertising market is new and rapidly evolving  and cannot yet be compared with traditional advertising media to gauge its effectiveness 
as a result  demand for and market acceptance of internet advertising is uncertain 
many of our merchant network alliance partners current and potential local merchant customers have little or no experience with internet advertising and have allocated only a limited portion of their advertising and marketing budgets to internet activities 
the adoption of internet advertising  particularly by entities that have historically relied upon traditional methods of advertising and marketing  requires the acceptance of a new way of advertising and marketing 
these customers may find internet advertising to be less effective for meeting their business needs than traditional methods of advertising and marketing 
in addition  there are some software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to a user s computer 
widespread adoption of this software could significantly undermine the commercial viability of internet advertising 
if the market for internet advertising fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect  our revenue will suffer 
there are currently no generally accepted standards for the measurement of the effectiveness of internet advertising 
standard measurements may need to be developed to support and promote internet advertising as a significant advertising medium 
our banner and site sponsorship advertising customers may challenge or refuse to accept either our or third party measurements of advertisement delivery 
if we are sued for content distributed through  or linked to by  our web site or those of our merchant network alliance partners  we may be required to spend substantial resources to defend ourselves and could be required to pay monetary damages we aggregate and distribute third party data over the internet 
in addition  third party web sites are accessible through our web site or those of our merchant network alliance partners 
as a result  we could be subject to legal claims for defamation  negligence  intellectual property infringement and product or service liability 
other claims may be based on errors or false or misleading information provided on our web site 
other claims may be based on links to sexually explicit web sites and sexually explicit advertisements 
we may need to expend substantial resources to investigate and defend these claims  regardless of whether we successfully defend against them 
while we carry general business insurance  the amount of coverage we maintain may not be adequate 
in addition  implementing measures to reduce our exposure to this liability may require us to spend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our content to users 
we may need to expend significant resources to protect against online security risks that could result in misappropriation of our proprietary information or cause interruption in our operations our networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses and other disruptive problems 
someone who is able to circumvent security measures could misappropriate our proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
internet and online service providers have experienced  and may in the future experience  interruptions in service as a result of the accidental or intentional actions of internet users  current and former employees or others 
we may need to expend significant resources protecting against the threat of security breaches or alleviating problems caused by breaches 
eliminating computer viruses and alleviating other security problems may require interruptions  delays or cessation of service 
we may be sued for disclosing to third parties personal identifying information without consent individuals whose names  addresses and telephone numbers appear in our yellow pages and white pages directories have occasionally contacted us because their phone numbers and addresses were unlisted with the telephone company 
while we have not received any formal legal claims from these individuals  we may receive claims in the future for which we may be liable 
in addition  if we begin disclosing to third parties personal identifying information about our users without consent or in violation of our privacy policy  we may face potential liability for invasion of privacy 
we may become subject to burdensome government regulation and legal uncertainties  which could limit our growth laws and regulations directly applicable to internet communications  commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent 
laws and regulations may be adopted covering issues such as user privacy  pricing  content  taxation and quality of products and services 
any new legislation could hinder the growth in use of the internet and other online services generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet and other online services as media of communications  commerce and advertising 
various us and foreign governments might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
the laws governing the internet remain largely unsettled  even in areas where legislation has been enacted 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet and internet advertising and directory services 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the internet 
if we cannot protect our domain names  our ability to successfully brand switchboard will be impaired we currently hold various web domain names  including switchboard 
com and mapsonus 
com 
the acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally is regulated by internet regulatory bodies 
the regulation of domain names in the united states and in foreign countries is subject to change 
governing bodies may establish additional top level domains  appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names 
as a result  we may be unable to acquire or maintain relevant domain names in all countries in which we conduct business 
this problem may be exacerbated by the length of time required to expand into any other country and the corresponding opportunity for others to acquire rights in relevant domain names 
furthermore  it is unclear whether laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights will be extended to protect domain names 
therefore  we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to  infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 
we may not be able to successfully carry out our business strategy of establishing a strong brand for switchboard if we cannot prevent others from using similar domain names or trademarks 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposures on our investment securities because the majority of our investments are short term 
we do not have any derivative instruments 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of our investment portfolio 
all the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our balances as of december
