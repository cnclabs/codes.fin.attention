critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are discussed in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more subjective or complex judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
lifo and retail inventory method for a significant portion of the company s inventory  cost is determined through use of the last in  first out lifo method for food distribution or the retail lifo method  as applicable 
under the retail lifo method  otherwise referred to as the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories are at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
inherent in the rim calculations are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as the resulting gross margins 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the fact that the rim is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  produce results which differ from actual 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
allowances for losses on receivables management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of its accounts and notes receivable portfolios 
in determining the adequacy of the allowances  management analyzes the value of the collateral  customer financial statements  historical collection experience  aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors 
although risk management practices and methodologies are utilized to determine the adequacy of the allowance  it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially impacted by different judgments as to collectibility based on the information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
reserves for closed properties and asset impairment the company maintains reserves for estimated losses on retail stores  distribution warehouses and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations 
calculating the estimated losses requires significant judgments and estimates to be made by management 
the company s reserves for closed properties could be materially affected by factors such as the extent of interested buyers  its ability to secure subleases  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the company s success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
these factors are significantly dependent on the general health of the economy and resultant demand for commercial property 
while management believes the current estimates of reserves on closed properties are adequate  it is possible that continued weakness in the real estate market could cause changes in the company s assumptions and may require additional reserves to be recorded 
impairment charges of long lived assets are recognized when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying value 
the company estimates net future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located and  when necessary  utilizes local real estate brokers 
it is management s intention to dispose of properties or sublease within one year  however  the expectations on timing of disposition or sublease and the estimated sales price or sublease income are impacted by variable factors such as inflation  the general health of the economy and resultant demand for commercial property and may require additional reserves to be recorded 
reserves for self insurance the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation and general and automobile liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported  discounted at a risk free interest rate 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation and general and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  discount rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
a basis point change in discount rates  based on changes in market rates would increase the company s liability by approximately million 
retirement plans the company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent  in part  on management s selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect its recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially impact pension and other post retirement obligations and future expenses 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company lowered its expected return on plan assets used for fiscal pension expense by basis points to percent and by an additional basis points to percent for fiscal pension expense 
the company also lowered its discount rate by basis points to percent for fiscal pension expense 
for fiscal  when not considering other changes in assumptions  the impact to pension expense of each basis point reduction in the discount rate is to increase pension expense by approximately million and the impact of each basis point reduction in expected return on plan assets is to increase pension expense by approximately million 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation was percent in fiscal the assumed health care cost trend rate will decrease by one percent each year for the next four years until it reaches the ultimate trend rate of percent 
the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant impact on the amounts reported 
for example  a one percent increase in the trend rate would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and the net periodic cost by million in fiscal in contrast  a one percent decrease in the trend rate would decrease the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million and the net periodic cost by million in fiscal the weighted average discount rates used in determining the benefit obligation were and for fiscal and  respectively 
goodwill management assesses the valuation of goodwill for each of the company s reporting units on an annual basis through the comparison of the fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily based on valuation studies performed by the company  which consider the discounted cash flow method consistent with the company s valuation guidelines 
valuation analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made by management 
the company s estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as competitive forces  customer behaviors  changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash from operating activities in fiscal from fiscal is primarily related to changes in deferred taxes resulting from the minimum pension liability in fiscal and restructure activities in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively

fiscal financing activities include the issuance of zero coupon convertible debentures with a yield of percent 
the proceeds from the offering  net of approximately million of expenses  were million and were initially used to pay down notes payable and were later used to retire a portion of the million in debt that matured in november management expects that the company will continue to replenish operating assets with internally generated funds 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels 
the company will continue to obtain short term financing from its revolving credit agreement with various financial institutions  as well as through its accounts receivable securitization program 
long term financing will be maintained through existing and new debt issuances 
the company s short term and long term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund its capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise 
maturities of debt issued will depend on management s views with respect to the relative attractiveness of interest rates at the time of issuance and other debt maturities 
in april  the company finalized a new three year  unsecured million revolving credit agreement with rates tied to libor plus to percent  based on the company s credit ratings 
the agreement contains various financial covenants including ratios for fixed charge interest coverage  asset coverage and debt leverage  in addition to a minimum net worth covenant

if the option is exercised  the company has the choice of paying the holder in cash  common stock or a combination of the two 
the debentures will generally be convertible if the closing price of the company s common stock on the new york stock exchange for twenty of the last thirty trading days of any fiscal quarter exceeds certain levels  at per share for the quarter ended june   and rising to per share at september  in the event of conversion  shares of the company s common stock will be issued per  debenture 
the debentures have an initial yield to maturity of  which is being accreted over the life of the debentures using the effective interest method 
the company may pay contingent cash interest for the six month period commencing november  and for any six month period thereafter if the average market price of the debentures for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for the debentures 
the debentures are classified as long term debt based on the company s ability and intent to refinance the obligation with long term debt if the company is required to repurchase the debentures 
the company is party to synthetic leasing programs for two of its major warehouses 
the leases expire in april and september as of april  the company has refinanced the lease that is expiring in fiscal with a new synthetic lease expiring in april including a purchase option of approximately million

 employers accounting for pension  requires the balance sheet to reflect a prepaid pension asset or minimum pension liability based on the current market value of plan assets and the accumulated benefit obligation of the plan 
based on both performance of the pension plan assets and planned assumption changes  the company recorded a net after tax adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million to reflect a minimum pension liability 
this adjustment was a non cash reduction of equity and did not impact earnings 
this adjustment will be revised in future years depending upon market performance and interest rate levels 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company lowered its expected return on plan assets used for fiscal pension expense by basis points to percent and by an additional basis points to percent for fiscal pension expense 
the company also lowered its discount rate by basis points to percent for fiscal pension expense 
for fiscal  when not considering other changes in assumptions or actual return on plan assets  the impact to pension expense of each basis point reduction in the discount rate is to increase pension expenses by approximately million and the impact of each basis point reduction in expected return on plan assets is to increase pension expense by approximately million
