item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations performance the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  is illustrated below for the past three fiscal years 
percent of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense other income  net equity in loss income of affiliated companies earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes earnings from continuing operations earnings from discontinued operations  net net earnings fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales decreased percent in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the net decrease is attributable to volume reductions and lower pricing due to competitive pressures in the auto glass segment and a slowdown in the commercial construction industry affecting the architectural segment 
these reductions were partially offset by revenue gains in the lso segment from new product introductions and conversions of value added picture framing glass 
on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  fell to percent for fiscal  improving from percent in fiscal the primary factors for the increased margins were from efficiencies gained as a result of the higher levels of capacity utilization in our lso segment as well as efficiency gains and sales of higher margin products in the architectural segment 
the combined impact of these items increased margins by percent 
this improvement was offset by price declines for the entire auto glass segment and reduced operating performance in our auto glass retail business 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales  increased to percent from percent  but the expenses remained essentially flat year over year at million versus million in fiscal increases in marketing and advertising costs related to the auto glass segment windshield repair initiative and the architectural segment renovation initiative were offset by reductions in salaries and related costs in the architectural and auto glass segments as a result of reducing the overall cost structure 
decreased performance based incentive expenses  lower training costs  gain on sale of assets and lower bad debt expenses also contributed to offset these higher expenses 
net interest expense decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting lower borrowing levels and a lower weighted average interest rate under our revolving credit agreement 
the effects of the lower borrowing levels and rate were offset by less interest collected from tax refunds received during the year in comparison to the prior year 
other income in fiscal reflects million pretax benefit of realized gains on the sale of investments held for our self insurance program as compared to million in the prior year 
the increased gains in the current year reflect a significant sale of marketable securities 
as part of normal investment portfolio management  the company s wholly owned insurance subsidiary sold appreciated marketable debt securities  creating this gain 
our equity in loss from affiliated companies was million in fiscal versus equity in loss of million in the prior year 
this additional loss is related to a decline in the performance of the ppg auto glass joint venture as a result of very competitive and reduced prices in the auto glass industry 
additionally  amendments made to supply agreements related to the ppg auto glass joint venture in the prior year second quarter led to lower earnings during the current year for ppg auto glass and increased 
table of contents earnings for the auto glass segment in the amount of million 
these declines were partially offset by elimination of funding for the terrasun joint venture  which was shut down during the third quarter of fiscal our effective income tax rate of percent of pre tax earnings from continuing operations decreased from the percent of pre tax earnings from continuing operations reported in fiscal this reduction was due to the donation of the terrasun patented technology to the illinois institute of technology iit in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which resulted in a significant deduction that reduced the current year rate in comparison to the prior year 
our fiscal earnings from continuing operations increased to million or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
the increase in earnings is largely attributable to the revenue and productivity gains within our lso segment  the elimination of goodwill amortization and reduced interest and taxes  offset by declines for our architectural and auto glass segments and losses from our affiliated companies 
current year income from discontinued operations resulted from a reduction in our estimates of the ultimate liabilities for the discontinued european curtainwall operation 
this caused our net income in the fourth quarter to increase by million  or diluted earnings per share 
we did not recognize earnings from operations of discontinued businesses in fiscal our fiscal net earnings were million  or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to million of net earnings  or diluted earnings per share  a year ago 
segment analysis architectural products and services in thousands net sales operating income depreciation and amortization capital expenditures assets architectural net sales for fiscal decreased percent to million from million in fiscal the decrease is due to the effects of the slowed economy on the north american commercial construction industry  and to delays in construction project timing 
the impact of these items resulted in lower sales for most of our architectural business units 
this segment s revenue decline was partially offset by an increase in institutional projects and revenues earned on renovation projects 
operating income for the segment in fiscal decreased percent to million from million in the prior year 
operating margin decreased to percent for fiscal from percent in fiscal the majority of the decline in operating income was due to excess capacity associated with the revenue decline 
we took actions in the latter part of the fourth quarter and early part of the first quarter of fiscal to lower the cost structure to reflect the current market outlook 
additionally  the level of institutional projects  which have lower margins  increased in fiscal  and we expect this project mix to continue in fiscal the margin decline was partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies in our glass and window fabricating business units 
the segment s depreciation and amortization is down slightly in comparison to the prior year as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminated amortization of goodwill for fiscal the fiscal amortization of goodwill at the architectural segment was million 
capital expenditures rose slightly year over year as the segment invested in more production equipment to increase capacity compared to the prior year 
total assets at the end of fiscal decreased compared to those at the end of fiscal as a result of reduced receivables and inventories 
automotive replacement glass and services in thousands net sales operating income depreciation and amortization capital expenditures assets 
table of contents auto glass net sales decreased percent to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower prices as a result of competitive pricing pressures in our retail and manufacturing business units along with a change in the product mix of business in retail to a higher level of fleet sales 
the average price in our retail business has declined by more than percent for the current year in comparison to fiscal our unit volume remained relatively consistent with the prior year  with declines in the first half of the year followed by improvements in year over year volumes in the second half 
market data indicates that unit demand for replacement auto glass in the us decreased percent during fiscal auto glass operating income decreased to million in fiscal from operating income of million in fiscal due to a combination of pricing declines in the retail and manufacturing businesses and operational inefficiencies within our retail business 
these items were partially offset by cost reductions implemented late in fiscal in our retail business and operational improvements within our manufacturing business unit as well as gains from the sale of real estate 
the segment continues to pursue opportunities to increase utilization and improve efficiencies to offset the tough industry conditions and pricing pressures 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million for fiscal from million for the prior year 
this is the result of the elimination of goodwill amortization of million and certain significant computer hardware and software applications becoming fully depreciated during fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal as we focused on utilizing the assets already deployed 
total assets decreased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal as a result of selling certain non core business assets in fiscal in addition  there were declines in working capital due to reductions of receivables in the retail business because of efforts to reduce our overall investment 
large scale optical technologies in thousands net sales operating income loss depreciation and amortization capital expenditures assets lso net sales of million increased percent over fiscal and operating income improved from a loss of million to income of million in fiscal these increases were the result of several successful new product introductions  particularly in applying coatings to acrylic  and continued conversions and wider distribution of value added picture framing glass 
also contributing were improvements in key consumer electronics and retail framing markets 
in addition  operational improvements from the company wide six sigma effort improved operating margins for the segment 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million for fiscal from million for the prior year due to the implementation of sfas no 
which eliminated goodwill amortization of million 
capital expenditures for fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal as we focused on utilizing the assets already deployed 
total assets decreased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal due to an overall reduction in working capital requirements 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales decreased percent in fiscal to million from million in fiscal net sales decreased percent compared to the prior year  after being adjusted for the july formation of ppg auto glass  llc ppg auto glass joint venture 
the results of the auto glass distribution unit  which we contributed to the joint venture  were not included in our continuing operations in fiscal  as they were through the second quarter of fiscal the remaining net decrease is attributable to volume reductions and lower pricing from competitive pressures in the auto glass segment and slowdown in the markets served by the lso segment 
these reductions were partially offset by increased revenues in our architectural segment due to increased volume and more efficient and effective operations 
additionally  fiscal comprised of weeks versus weeks in fiscal on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  fell to percent for fiscal  improving from percent in fiscal the primary factors were efficiencies gained in our architectural segment  as well as cost reductions and sales of higher margin product mix in that segment 
these improvements impacted margin by percent 
the net of the formation of the ppg auto glass joint venture and pricing amendments to the ppg auto glass supply agreements made during the second quarter 
table of contents of fiscal increased margins by percent 
these increases were offset by significant margin reductions within the lso segment 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales  increased to percent from percent  but decreased million 
key components attributable to the decline in sg a expenses were reductions in depreciation  and salaries and related costs in the auto glass segment to reduce its overall cost structure 
these declines were partially offset by increased performance based incentive expenses and training costs 
net interest expense decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting significantly lower borrowing levels and a lower weighted average interest rate under the revolving credit agreement 
also contributing to this decrease were interest components of tax refunds received during the year 
our equity in loss from affiliated companies was million in fiscal versus equity in income of million in the prior year 
the amendments made to the supply agreements related to the ppg auto glass joint venture in the current year second quarter led to lower earnings during the year for ppg auto glass 
this decline was somewhat offset by lower costs at the terrasun joint venture  which was shut down during the third quarter of fiscal our effective income tax rate of percent of pre tax earnings from continuing operations decreased from the percent of pre tax earnings from continuing operations reported in fiscal this reduction was due to a decrease in tax reserves as a result of the closure of certain tax periods and due to the relationship of permanent book and tax differences 
our fiscal earnings from continuing operations increased to million or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
the increase in earnings is largely attributable to the revenue and productivity gains within our architectural segment  a reduced cost structure in the auto glass related businesses  and lower interest and taxes  offset by losses in our lso segment 
we did not report earnings from operations of discontinued businesses in fiscal in fiscal  we reported earnings from operations of discontinued businesses of million after tax  or diluted earnings per share 
our fiscal net earnings were million  or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to million  or diluted earnings per share  a year ago 
segment analysis architectural products and services architectural net sales for fiscal increased percent to million from million in fiscal the increase is due to an increase in the number of curtainwall installation projects  due to the new renovation initiatives and growth at new and mature shops  and improved operations allowing for more capacity and shipments at our window systems and curtainwall manufacturing business 
operating income for the segment in fiscal increased percent to million from million in the prior year 
the resultant operating margins increased to percent for fiscal from percent in fiscal the majority of the improvement in operating income was driven by sales mix changes to higher margin products and efficiencies in manufacturing in glass fabricating  partially offset by slightly lower margins in installation 
the segment s depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures remained flat for the period compared to prior year 
total assets at the end of fiscal were consistent with those at the end of fiscal automotive replacement glass and services auto glass net sales decreased percent to million in fiscal segment revenues  which declined percent compared to fiscal after being adjusted for the ppg auto glass joint venture  decreased due to reduced retail unit volumes from loss of market share and lower prices as a result of competitive pricing pressures 
market data indicates that unit demand for replacement auto glass in the us increased percent during fiscal auto glass operating income increased to million for fiscal from operating income of million in fiscal due to a combination of improvements in the retail business and changes in ppg auto glass supply agreements 
approximately percent of the operating income improvement resulted from amendments made to the supply agreements related to the ppg auto glass joint venture  effective beginning the second quarter of this year 
these amendments permanently adjusted pricing to the 
table of contents joint venture from our windshield manufacturing business  resulting in higher income for the segment 
the remaining gains were the result of operational improvements and cost reductions implemented late fiscal for retail 
at the end of fiscal  auto glass had harmon autoglass retail locations and co branded facilities 
the segment continues to pursue opportunities to increase utilization and improve efficiencies 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million for fiscal from million for the prior year 
this is the result of certain significant computer hardware and software applications becoming fully depreciated during fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal total assets decreased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal this decrease is attributable to the reduction of distribution business assets not included in the contribution to the ppg auto glass joint venture 
we sold certain remaining assets and realized the reduction of working capital assets 
in addition  there were reductions in working capital requirements due to reductions of receivables in the retail business 
large scale optical technologies lso net sales of million decreased percent over fiscal the decrease in net sales and resulting operating loss were a direct result of the severe downturn in the pc industry and the slowdown in retail framing markets  along with the closure of the san diego facility during the first quarter of the year 
lso reported an operating loss of million for fiscal  compared to operating income of million for fiscal depreciation and amortization decreased to million for fiscal from million for the prior year due to sale and leaseback agreements entered into on certain production equipment during fiscal the leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
capital expenditures for fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal total assets decreased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal this decrease is attributable to the sale of assets from the shutdown of the san diego facility  and an overall reduction in working capital requirements due to the slowdown 
related party transactions as a result of our percent interest in ppg auto glass of which ppg industries  inc holds the remaining interest  various transactions the company enters into with ppg auto glass are deemed to be related party transactions 
under the terms of a multi year agreement expiring in june  the company s retail auto glass business is committed to purchasing at least percent of its replacement windshield needs from ppg auto glass 
the terms are negotiated equivalent to an arm s length basis 
we believe that the amounts paid for such transactions represent the amounts that would normally be paid to unrelated third parties for similar transactions 
discontinued operations during fiscal  the company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of vis n service corporation vis n  a non auto glass focused  and third party administered  claims processor  in two separate transactions with no impact to net earnings 
vis n is presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements and notes 
prior periods have been restated 
at march   reserves totaling million represented the remaining estimated future net cash outflows associated with the exit from discontinued operations 
during fiscal  we reduced our estimates of these liabilities by million million  net of tax as a result of favorable resolution of certain exposures as well as from reductions in estimated future liabilities for the discontinued european curtainwall operations 
additionally  we made million of payments related to warranty and legal costs 
the majority of these cash expenditures are expected to be made within the next three years 
the primary components of the reserves relate to the remaining exit costs from previously discontinued businesses 
in several transactions in fiscal years through  the company completed the sale of its large scale domestic curtainwall business  the sale of the company s detention security business and its exit from international curtainwall operations 
the long term elements within the reserves relating to the international curtainwall operations include bonds outstanding  of which the precise degree of liability related to these matters will not be known until they are settled within the uk and french courts 
additionally  any long term product liability issues  consisting of warranty and rework issues  on these international construction projects are reserved 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash effect  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures proceeds from dispositions of property borrowing activities  net purchase of company common stock operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline over the past year is attributable to the decline in operating income and changes in non cash working capital 
during the current year  working capital  excluding cash  increased million from fiscal due to decreases in compensation related accruals  and the amount and timing of warranty related accruals 
non cash working capital remained relatively flat in the prior year in comparison to fiscal management of working capital resources is a focus for the company  and we expect reductions in working capital in fiscal investing activities 
capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for the last three years are lower as compared to fiscal and as a direct result of filling the capacity of significant expansion projects initiated in these earlier years 
the company s capacity utilization at the end of fiscal was at percent  indicating that capital requirements for expansion will be limited over the foreseeable future as growth initiatives fill the remaining available capacity 
in fiscal  the company expects to incur capital expenditures as necessary to maintain existing facilities  safety and information systems as well as some capacity improvements within the lso segment 
fiscal expenditures are expected to be less than million 
in fiscal  and  the company had proceeds on the sale of certain land  buildings and equipment totaling million  million and million  respectively 
we have been focused on reducing our investment in non core business assets over the past several years  which has resulted in these proceeds 
we do not anticipate the same level of sales to occur in fiscal as has occurred in the prior three years 
included in the fiscal and fiscal amounts were sale and leaseback agreements on miscellaneous equipment totaling million and million  respectively 
under these and its other sale and leaseback agreements  the company has an option to purchase the equipment at projected future fair market value upon expiration of the leases  which occurs in fiscal  and we are not expecting to have any such agreements for fiscal we continue to review our portfolio of businesses and their assets in comparison to our internal strategic and performance objectives 
as part of this review  we may acquire other businesses  further invest in  fully divest and or sell off parts of our current businesses 
financing activities 
net payments on all of our borrowings for fiscal  and fiscal were million  million and million  respectively 
we continued to focus on debt reduction during fiscal  evidenced by the reduction in our debt to invested capital percentage  which improved to percent at the end of fiscal compared to percent at the end of fiscal the majority of our long term debt at the end of the year  million  consisted of bank borrowings under a syndicated revolving credit facility 
we expect to reduce debt further during fiscal we initiated a common stock repurchase program in fiscal to buy back million shares 
we completed the program by paying out million throughout the year for an average price of per share 
the company also purchased million of company stock for various incentive compensation plans 
in april  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares 
stock purchases may be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices 
it is our present intention to use the program solely to offset the dilutive impact of management stock option exercises and to fund our equity based compensation plans 

table of contents other financing activities 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity future cash payments due by period in thousands thereafter total borrowings under credit facility industrial revenue bonds other long term debt operating leases undiscounted purchase commitments other obligations total cash obligations during fiscal  we entered into a four year  unsecured  committed  revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
this credit facility requires us to maintain levels of net worth and certain financial ratios 
these ratios include maintaining an interest coverage ratio earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by interest expense of more than and a debt to ebitda ratio of less than at march   these ratios were and  respectively 
if we are not in compliance with these ratios at the end of any quarter with respect to interest coverage or at the end of any day with respect to debt to ebitda ratio  the lender may terminate the commitment and or declare any loan then outstanding to be due 
this credit facility replaced the company s previously existing million secured credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate for borrowings under these agreements during fiscal and was percent and percent  respectively 
during fiscal  million of variable rate industrial bonds were issued and the resulting proceeds were loaned to the company to finance a portion of our capital projects in wausau  wi 
during fiscal  million of variable rate industrial revenue bonds were issued and the resulting proceeds were loaned to us to finance a portion of our capital projects in faribault  mn and mccook  il 
the industrial revenue bonds in the total above are supported by million of letters of credit that reduce our availability of funds under the million credit facility 
these letters of credit are not reflected in the standby letters of credit in the table below 
from time to time  we acquire the use of certain assets  such as retail shops  warehouses  automobiles  forklifts  vehicles  office equipment and some manufacturing equipment through operating leases 
many of these operating leases have termination penalties 
however  because the assets are used in the conduct of our business operations  it is unlikely that any significant portion of these operating leases would be terminated prior to the normal expiration of their lease terms 
therefore  we consider the risk related to termination penalties to be minimal 
the purchase commitments set forth in the table above relate to contractual obligations that expire on december   with a third party that provides call center operations for our auto glass segment retail business 
the contract is structured such that there is a minimum number of units that must be processed through the third party s facility 
the amounts listed in the above table are equivalent to the minimum number of units required during the year at the minimum contractual price 
the contract includes a buy out provision that diminishes over time 
the provision amounts are million and million for fiscal year and  respectively 
the other obligations relate to noncompete and consulting agreements with former employees 
amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands thereafter total standby letters of credit in the ordinary course of business  predominantly in our installation business  we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any non performance 
the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of installation projects that are in process and in our backlog 
at march   these bonds totaled million 
we have never been required to pay on these performance based bonds 
the company maintains interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert million and million of variable rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings at percent and percent  respectively 
the swap agreements expire in fiscal and  respectively 
we experienced a material increase in our risk retention for our third party product liability coverages in fiscal  and were able to continue this coverage with increased premiums for fiscal a material construction project rework event would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

table of contents for fiscal  we believe that current cash on hand  cash generated from operating activities  and the available credit facility should be adequate to fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures 
if we are unable to generate enough cash through operations to satisfy our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures  we have available funds from our committed revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet activities 
with the exception of routine operating leases  we had no off balance sheet financing at march  or march  outlook overall revenue growth for fiscal versus fiscal is anticipated to be in the low single digits  with year on year growth occurring in the second half 
our architectural segment is expected to have revenues that are flat to slightly above fiscal  with second half growth dependent on backlog timing and improving market conditions 
commercial construction market forecasters are now projecting a turnaround in early calendar our auto glass segment revenues are expected to be slightly above fiscal  as growth in retail will be slightly offset by competitive pricing in manufacturing 
our lso segment revenues are expected to grow in the high single digits through expanded distribution of value added picture framing glass products and further penetration of the projection television and other consumer electronic industries with new products featuring anti reflective coatings on glass and acrylic 
gross margin percentages are expected to decline slightly  as productivity improvements and cost controls somewhat offset increases in wages and insurance costs 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to be flat as a percent of sales 
we expect the results from the equity in affiliates to show a slightly higher loss in comparison to fiscal due to competitive market conditions in the auto glass industry 
we expect the effective tax rate to be percent 
earnings per share are expected to be in the low end of the range of to  with a year over year decline in the first quarter  followed by improvement in the balance of the year 
in order for us to be in the higher end of the range  the market conditions in the commercial construction industry must improve more rapidly than we currently anticipate 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets has ceased and instead the carrying value of these assets will be evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value based test annually  or immediately if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist 
this statement also requires a reassessment of the useful lives of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective march   and has discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
the company has determined that it does not have intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
an initial assessment of the recoverability of goodwill recorded on the date of adoption was completed in the second quarter of additionally  we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of no impairment was present upon performing either of the impairment tests 
the fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies 
in addition  the company reassessed the useful lives of its identifiable intangible assets and determined that the lives were appropriate 
the company will test goodwill of each of its reporting units for impairment annually in connection with its fourth quarter planning process or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 

table of contents if the company had been accounting for its goodwill and intangible assets under sfas no 
for all prior periods presented  the company s net income and earnings per common share would have been as follows in thousands  except per share data net income reported net earnings add back amortization expense  net of tax adjusted net income earnings per share basic reported earnings per share impact of amortization expense  net of tax adjusted earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted reported earnings per share impact of amortization expense  net of tax adjusted earnings per share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding basic diluted in august  the fasb issued sfas no

the company adopted this standard on march   with no impact to its consolidated financial statements in fiscal in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of sfas nos 
 and  amendment of sfas no 
 and technical corrections 
the significant items from sfas that are relevant to the company are the statements regarding extinguishment of debt and the accounting for sale leaseback transactions 
the provisions of this statement are applicable for fiscal years beginning after  transactions entered into after and financial statements issued on or subsequent to may  the adoption of this statement has not had a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb no 
sfas no 
provides alternative transition methods for companies that make a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in these consolidated financial statements  and its adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
interpretation no 
elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees 
it also clarifies that at the time an entity issues a guarantee  the issuing entity must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee 
however  the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations do not apply to product warranties  guarantees accounted for as derivatives  or other guarantees of an entity s own future performance 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation as of march  the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after march  we have not yet determined the effect of adopting the initial recognition and measurement provisions on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies management has evaluated the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements and related notes and believes those policies and estimates to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies and estimates applied in the presentation of our financial statements relate to accounting for future events 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  management is required to exercise 
table of contents judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical to our business and in the understanding of our results of operations and financial position revenue recognition most of our sales are generally unconditional sales that are recorded when product is shipped and invoiced to our customers 
normally our sales terms are free on board shipping point fob shipping point for our product sales 
however  approximately percent of our consolidated sales and percent of our architectural segment sales are recorded on a percentage of completion basis as it relates to revenue earned from construction contracts 
under this methodology  we compare the total costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs for the contract and record that proportion of the total contract revenue in the period 
contract costs include materials  labor and other direct costs related to contract performance 
provisions are established for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in sales only when customers have approved them 
a significant number of estimates are used in these computations 
goodwill impairment to determine if there has been any impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluate the goodwill on our balance sheet annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
we base our determination of value using a discounted cash flow methodology that involves significant judgments based upon projections of future performance 
the forecasts reflected in the valuation of our retail auto glass reporting unit assumes that we will successfully turnaround and outperform expectations for the auto glass replacement market 
there can be no assurances that these forecasts can be attained 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances 
reserves for disputes and claims regarding product liability and warranties from time to time  we are subject to claims associated with our products and services  principally as a result of disputes with our customers involving our architectural products 
the time period from when a claim is asserted to when it is resolved either by dismissal  negotiation  settlement or litigation can be several years 
while we maintain product liability insurance  the arrangements include significant self retention of risk in the form of policy deductibles 
in addition  certain claims could be determined to be uninsured 
we reserve based on our estimates of known claims  as well as anticipated claims for possible product warranty and rework costs 
reserves for discontinued operations we reserve for the remaining estimated future cash outflows associated with the exit from discontinued operations 
the majority of these cash expenditures are expected to be made within the next three years 
the primary components of the accruals relate to the remaining exit costs from the international curtainwall operations of our large scale construction business 
these long term accruals include settlement of outstanding performance bonds  of which the precise degree of liability related to these matters will not be known until they are settled within the french and uk courts 
we also reserve for product liability issues and the related legal costs for specific projects completed both domestically and internationally 
we reserve based on known claims  estimating their expected losses  as well as anticipated claims for possible product warranty and rework costs for these discontinued operation projects 
self insurance reserves we obtain substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential losses for general liability  workers compensation and automobile liability risk 
however  an amount of risk is retained on a self insured basis through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
reserve requirements are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses 
additionally  we maintain a self insurance reserve for our health insurance programs maintained for the benefit of our eligible employees 
we estimate a reserve based on historical levels of amounts incurred  but not reported 
as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving apogee managers with responsibility for financial reporting  credit  product and project management  quality  legal  tax and outside advisors such as consultants  engineers  lawyers and actuaries 
the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these future events and develop the estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements related to these events are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate apogee management 
however  outcomes could differ from our estimates and could materially adversely affect our future operating results  financial position and cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk is sensitivity to interest rates  which is the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce net earnings of the company 
to manage our direct risk from changes in market interest rates  management actively monitors the interest sensitive components of our balance sheet  primarily debt obligations  as well as market interest rates in order to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on net earnings and cash flow 
we use interest swaps to fix a portion of our variable rate borrowings from fluctuations in interest rates 
as of march   we had interest swaps covering million of variable rate debt 
the net present liability associated with these swaps is million at the end of fiscal the primary measure of interest rate risk is the simulation of net income under different interest rate environments 
the approach used to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis 
this approach calculates the impact on net earnings  relative to a base case scenario  of rates increasing or decreasing gradually over the next months by basis points 
this change in interest rates affecting our financial instruments would result in approximately a million impact to net earnings 
as interest rates increase  net earnings decrease  as interest rates decrease  net earnings increase 
we have a policy of using forward exchange contracts to hedge our net exposures  by currency  related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  and future firm commitments of our operations 
forward exchange contracts are also used from time to time to manage near term foreign currency cash requirements 
the primary objective of these hedging activities is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes  net of related tax effects  are minimized
