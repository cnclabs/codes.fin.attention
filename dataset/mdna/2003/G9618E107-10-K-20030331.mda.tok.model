onebeacon s results for the year ended december  reflected improvements over results 
steps taken since june  to improve the business  favorable market conditions and good weather have all contributed to this improvement 
onebeacon s core trade ratio as defined in the summary of operations by segment  onebeacon  underwriting results section below improved to for  versus for the year ended december  which included approximately five points as a result of the terrorist attacks of september   the attacks 
onebeacon s overall trade ratio which includes business subject to the renewal rights agreement and certain other insurance products improved to for  versus for the year ended december  which included approximately three points as a result of the attacks 
white mountains expects onebeacon s operations  particularly its core operations  will continue to improve in as the effects of better pricing  underwriting and claims management continue to emerge and as business subject to the renewal rights agreement continues to be reduced 
in  onebeacon expects to generate an underwriting profit by taking advantage of its strong balance sheet and the hard market which exists in many sectors 
folksamerica s statutory combined ratio  as adjusted to include the favorable effects of retroactive reinsurance  improved to for  from for which included twelve points of catastrophe losses  including approximately six points as a result of the attacks 
the statutory combined ratio for included three points of catastrophe losses  mainly due to million of additional losses related to the attacks and million of net incurred losses related to european floods during the third quarter of aside from the lower level of incurred catastrophe losses  the improvement in folksamerica s results is attributable to the continuing positive trends in reinsurance pricing  terms and conditions that began before  and became more dramatic after  the attacks 
white mountains expects the favorable trends in folksamerica s operations to continue in as the effects of better prices  terms and conditions are further reflected in its underwriting results 
white mountains also expects to experience favorable results in from its other reinsurance operations consisting of fund american re  wmu and its investment in montpelier as they continue to develop under favorable market conditions

onebeacon onebeacon reported comprehensive net income of million for the year ended december   consisting of million of comprehensive net income from investment results  offset by a net underwriting loss of million 
onebeacon s comprehensive net loss was million for the seven months ended december   which consisted of a net underwriting loss of million  offset by million in comprehensive net income from investment results

a statutory combined ratio is calculated by adding i the ratio of incurred loss and lae to earned premiums the loss and lae ratio and ii the ratio of commissions  premium taxes and other underwriting expenses  including general and administrative expenses  to written premiums the expense ratio 
in calculating onebeacon s trade ratio  the expense ratio is modified by dividing certain other underwriting expenses  including general and administrative expenses  by earned premiums rather than written premiums 
onebeacon believes that the trade ratio is the best measure of the underwriting performance of its business because it relates the elements of the expense ratio relating to the cost of producing the business to written premiums and the elements relating to the cost of operating the business to earned premiums 
for purposes of the trade ratio  fees earned by autoone insurance  onebeacon s limited assignment distribution business in new york  have been reflected as a reduction of net loss and lae incurred 
statutory accounting principles reflect such fees as a reduction of general and administrative expenses 
b a gaap combined ratio is calculated by adding i the loss and lae ratio and ii the ratio of acquisition and other expenses to earned premiums 
the gaap combined ratio differs from the trade ratio in the expense ratio calculation 
the gaap combined ratio measures all expenses to earned premiums whereas the trade ratio measures acquisition costs to written premiums 
additionally  gaap results record fees earned by autoone insurance as premiums as compared to reduction of net loss and lae incurred for trade ratio purposes 
the gaap combined ratio also reflects differences between statutory accounting principles and gaap  such as in accounting for deferred acquisition costs  pensions and post retirement benefits and certain purchase accounting adjustments 
also  during  gaap curtailment gains on onebeacon s pension and retiree health care plans are not included in the trade ratio 
onebeacon s total gaap combined ratio for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
onebeacon s underwriting results for the year ended december  improved from those for the seven months after the date of the acquisition 
improved pricing and other market conditions  mild weather and actions taken since the acquisition have contributed to the improvements 
additionally  onebeacon shifted its commercial lines business mix away from historically less profitable lines  such as workers compensation and its contractors book within commercial multiple peril 
workers compensation represented of onebeacon s total commercial lines net written premiums in  down from in onebeacon s contractors book represented of total commercial multiple peril lines net written premiums in  down from in regional premium writings declined further during as the book continued to be repositioned for improved profitability 
concentrations of value in new york city  other urban areas and the atlantic seacoast were decreased to reduce onebeacon s exposure to terrorism and coastal wind damage 
specialty and autoone insurance premium writings grew and are expected to continue to grow in the trade ratio for core operations was for the year ended december  compared to for all of net written premiums and earned premiums for core operations were both billion for the year ended and billion and billion  respectively  for all of  as price increases were offset by reductions in volume necessary to re underwrite the book and reduce exposure to catastrophe claims 
onebeacon s total trade ratio  including non core business  was for the year ended december  compared to for all of net written premiums and earned premiums on onebeacon s total business were down to billion and billion  respectively  in from billion and billion  respectively  for all of  as premiums from non core operations continued to run off 
loss and lae totalled billion for both the year ended december  and for the seven months ended december  a full year over year comparison showed a decrease of billion from billion in  which is primarily due to the drop in business volume resulting from the renewal rights agreement 
loss and lae for included million of reserve strengthening recorded during the fourth quarter of after onebeacon completed a detailed study on its non asbestos and environmental reserves 
as previously described  onebeacon has a e coverage under the nico cover 
management believes the nico cover will be adequate to cover all of its a e obligations 
reserves for accident years and prior were increased by million  while reserves for accident year were reduced by million 
reserve increases for and prior accident years primarily relate to increases in reserves for workers compensation coverages reduced by decreases in reserves for unallocated lae 
workers compensation reserves for accident years and prior primarily  and increased million on reserves of billion as of december  
the reserve increases related primarily to a continuing unfavorable trend of increases in workers compensation medical claims and indemnity costs 
based on a study provided by the national council on compensation insurance ncci  a not for profit rating  statistical and data management services organization and a significant source for workers compensation data  medical claims costs rose an average of during  compared with an average of during increases of this magnitude were not expected when setting reserves 
average workers compensation indemnity costs rose during compared with an increase of during decreases in reserves for unallocated lae resulted from completion of an activity based cost study which indicated future claim servicing costs were less than originally projected 
this decrease primarily related to multiple peril and general liability coverages 
the reduction in reserves for accident year was due in large part to favorable development on property losses from the attacks 
during the fourth quarter of  onebeacon increased net reserves for prior accident years by million million before recoveries of approximately million under the general reinsurance cover 
these increases in net reserves related to long tail lines of business  primarily for accident years through reserve increases before recoveries under the general reinsurance cover were primarily from million for workers compensation on reserves as of december  of million  million for general liability on reserves as of december  of billion  million for multiple peril on reserves as of december  of billion and million for commercial automobile liability on reserves as of december  of million 
as further described in amendment no 
to form s filed march   these increases in reserves reflected the impact of external factors as well as onebeacon specific factors 
external factors included the emergence of construction defect losses  medical inflation  a general deterioration in market pricing  terms and conditions  adverse judicial rulings and higher than anticipated legal costs 
these external factors were also experienced throughout the property and casualty insurance industry as evidenced by adverse development reported since by other property and casualty insurers 
a significant portion of the reserve increases is attributable onebeacon specific factors including changes in the mix of business written by general accident and  to a lesser extent  commercial union during the mid s that along with being adversely impacted by external factors  in hindsight  was poorly written and priced 
white mountains has taken significant actions with respect to onebeacon since it completed the acquisition including shedding non core businesses through the renewal rights agreement  increasing prices  reevaluating the risks  terms and conditions associated with renewing certain policies and in appropriate cases declining to issue a renewal policy  eliminating unprofitable products  accounts and agents  improving the claims adjudication  settlement administration and processing functions and improving management information systems and deploying new technology to contribute to process improvement and overall results 
see loss and loss adjustment expense reserves within the onebeacon section of item of this report 
insurance acquisition expenses  which consist primarily of commission expenses  totalled million for the year ended december  for the seven months ended december   insurance acquisition expenses totalled million 
a full year over year comparison showed a decrease of million from million in  which is principally due to the decrease in business volume resulting from the renewal rights agreement 
general and administrative expenses totalled million for the year ended december  for the seven months ended december   general and administrative expenses totalled million 
a full year over year comparison showed a decrease of million from million in recurring general and administrative expenses did not decrease proportionately to the reduction in onebeacon s premiums in  as the costs related to overhead and other administrative functions which previously supported the book of business transferred to liberty mutual are being reduced more slowly than the corresponding premium volume 
general and administrative expenses for will eventually reflect the elimination of overhead functions that will no longer be needed to support the business transferred to liberty mutual 
management expects that its general and administrative expenses will continue to decrease in as it takes further cost reduction initiatives 
during  onebeacon s cost reduction initiatives included the curtailment of its pension and retiree medical plan and a reduction in costs related to headcount  excluding costs relating to new operations such as autoone insurance and obpp 
as a result of the curtailment of onebeacon s pension plan and retiree health benefits  general and administrative expenses in include a pre tax gain of million 
effective january   onebeacon adopted an employee stock ownership plan  which is a onebeacon funded  qualified retirement plan 
management believes that its employee benefits plans are now aligned with the interests of white mountains shareholders  as its plans are now performance oriented  not entitlement oriented 
core underwriting results core operations consist of personal and commercial lines sold through agents in the northeast  and specialty businesses underwritten in various geographic areas 
core operations do not include business transferred to liberty mutual through the renewal rights agreement and certain other insurance operations 
personal lines 
onebeacon writes the majority of its personal business in new york  massachusetts  new jersey and maine 
new york  massachusetts and new jersey are all states with difficult automobile regulatory environments and significant involuntary market loads 
a dedicated staff with expertise in the unique regulatory aspects of each state manages each business 
throughout its personal lines business  onebeacon has focused on improving its underwriting results 
onebeacon improved premium adequacy in through rate increases approved by regulators  re underwriting efforts  aggressive rate pursuit actions and continued improvement in insurance to value programs in its homeowners line 
as a result  onebeacon achieved price increases of and in automobile and homeowners  respectively  during  compared with increases of and in onebeacon s mix of personal lines products for automobile  homeowners and custom pac products was  and  respectively  of personal lines net written premium for  compared with  and for all of onebeacon s personal lines written premium volume from core operations for increased as compared to all of due primarily to new business produced by autoone insurance 
excluding autoone insurance written premium and lad servicing fees  written premium volume decreased from written premium for all of this decrease is due to actions to reduce exposure to windstorms on property located in coastal areas  a decision to reduce exposure to the private passenger automobile business in massachusetts due to unfavorable market conditions and the formation of a reciprocal insurance carrier in new jersey 
in  personal lines written premium relating to the private passenger automobile business in new jersey will continue to decline due to the transfer of onebeacon s business to a newly formed reciprocal carrier  new jersey skylands insurance association see new jersey skylands within the onebeacon section of item of this report 
autoone insurance  a division of onebeacon  became a limited assignment distribution carrier in late in order to capitalize on significant market opportunities created by the growth of the nyaip 
during  autoone insurance wrote premiums and billed lad fees of approximately million for policies written for third parties 
autoone insurance has completed its lad contracting for  with third parties committed for approximately million of nyaip quota premium and lad fees 
the automobile insurance plans service office aipso  a management organization and service provider for various insurance industry groups  has projected that total nyaip quota premiums for will be relatively flat compared to at between billion and billion 
rate increases implemented in the nyaip program during  along with overall improved loss ratios due to changes in plan mix a higher percentage of standard risks flowing into the assigned risk pool associated with growth in nyaip volume  have led to better pricing and resulted in a decrease in the average lad fee for contracts covering the year 
such decreases in lad fees were expected and management believes that the margins in the program remain adequate for the coming year and that underwriting results will remain acceptable 
commercial lines 
commercial lines underwriting results significantly improved in due to the positive impact of underwriting and pricing initiatives as well as good weather 
however  they fell short of onebeacon s target due to the effects of large losses and a significant decrease in onebeacon s premium base 
premium written for decreased from all of primarily due to actions to reduce the concentration of risks subject to terrorism exposure  as well as continued efforts to re underwrite the commercial book  terminate underperforming accounts and agencies and tighten credit terms toward market standards 
s trade ratio includes approximately points of losses attributable to the attacks 
onebeacon s mix of commercial lines products for multiple peril  commercial automobile and workers compensation was  and of onebeacon s commercial lines net written premium for  compared with  and during all of price increases of were achieved for business written during as compared to for all of specialty lines 
overall underwriting results for specialty businesses were excellent with written premiums growing due to rate increases  favorable weather conditions  high renewal retentions and new business 
during  onebeacon wrote specialty lines premiums of million  a increase as compared to million written during all of the written premium includes million from imu and million from agri  representing and increases in written premium  respectively  as compared to all of specialty lines written premium also includes million of new written premiums during from d o  professional liability and medical provider excess markets coverages written by obpp  which commenced operations in february non core underwriting results results for onebeacon s non core businesses during were worse than expected 
written premiums decreased to million in  from billion for all of  generating a pre tax underwriting loss of million for for the seven months ended december   non core business generated a pre tax underwriting loss of million 
non core operations include the results of business subject to the reinsurance provisions of the renewal rights agreement 
for  written premiums on business subject to the renewal rights agreement decreased to million from billion for all of in  onebeacon also recognized a million pretax write off of deferred acquisition costs associated with its business subject to the renewal rights agreement 
in accordance with the renewal rights agreement  a reinsurance agreement pro rates results so that onebeacon assumed approximately two thirds of the operating results and cash flows from renewals through october  and assumes approximately one third of the operating results and cash flows from renewals from november  to october  beyond november   net written premiums from business subject to the renewal rights agreement will be nil  although onebeacon has an option to assume of all of liberty mutual s regional agency markets business for the years to on a pari passu basis with liberty mutual 
in addition  onebeacon will receive commissions of of written premiums on policies transferred to liberty mutual that are renewed in the year after the renewal rights agreement expires 
the renewal rights agreement was undertaken so that onebeacon could exit a substantial portion of its non core businesses and further strengthen and focus on its core commercial and personal lines located in the northeast and its core specialty operations where it historically had better operating results 
the underwriting performance of the business subject to the renewal rights agreement historically had  and for the remainder of the renewal rights agreement is expected to continue to have  a higher relative underwriting loss than that of onebeacon s core businesses 
therefore  although onebeacon s premium levels have declined  and are expected to continue to decline  as a result of the renewal rights agreement  onebeacon s future results of operations and financial position are expected to improve from what onebeacon would have expected had the agreement not been executed 
liberty mutual has control over a variety of factors which could impact the underwriting performance of renewal rights agreement business  such as pricing adequacy  actual renewal premium volume  claims management  catastrophe exposures and other considerations 
management believes liberty mutual has done an acceptable job in each of these areas except for the handling of pre november  claims 
pursuant to the renewal rights agreement  liberty mutual assumed control of onebeacon s claims offices in the regions subject to the renewal rights agreement and is responsible for servicing claims from the onebeacon policies written prior to november   as well as policies which have renewed in those regions since that date 
service agreements were put in place in connection with the renewal rights agreement  through which liberty mutual became a tpa for those claims 
upon review of claims information during the third and fourth quarters of  onebeacon s management determined that average paid claims in offices where liberty was acting as a tpa were higher than expected 
as a result  management has begun a process to directly handle more of those claims related to policies written prior to the renewal rights agreement and expects that substantially all such claims will be handled directly by onebeacon by the end of reinsurance folksamerica

a statutory combined ratio is calculated by adding i the ratio of incurred loss and lae to earned premiums the loss and lae ratio and ii the ratio of commissions  premium taxes and other underwriting expenses  including general and administrative expenses  to written premiums the expense ratio 
folksamerica s statutory combined ratios do not take into account the full favorable impact of the retroactive coverage provided by the imagine cover or the indemnification of losses associated with certain of folksamerica s acquisitions in recent years 
the reinsurance benefit recorded in its statutory financial statements on recoverables for adverse development on prior years reserves is not included in folksamerica s statutory combined ratio under statutory accounting principles  however  adverse development on reserves covered under this contract is required to be included in its statutory combined ratio 
folksamerica believes that the adjusted statutory combined ratio is a better measure of the full economic impact of its reinsurance results 
folksamerica s comprehensive net income from underwriting results of million for was an improvement of million over the comprehensive net loss from underwriting results of million for folksamerica s financial results improved during and are expected to continue to improve in as the effects of favorable reinsurance conditions are recognized in underwriting results 
in  folksamerica experienced significant rate increases and improved terms across virtually all lines of business written 
folksamerica s gross and net written premiums were million and million for  respectively  representing an approximately and increase over the increase was due to increased pricing on folksamerica s expiring and renewed contracts  increased shares on renewed contacts and new contracts resulting from the increased demand of reinsurance buyers for placing reinsurance with responsible  well capitalized reinsurers 
white mountains expects this trend to continue for the foreseeable future  particularly considering the announced withdrawal from the market of several reinsurers and the potential effect of negative rating agency actions in regard to certain other reinsurers in the last several months 
also  contributing to the increase in net written premiums was folksamerica s new relationship with wmu  which has resulted in referrals of international reinsurance placements to folksamerica 
additionally  under a new quota share agreement  folksamerica cedes up to of substantially all underwritten business referred to it by wmu and of substantially all its short tailed  non casualty excess of loss business to olympus 
folksamerica also receives an override commission on all premiums ceded to olympus 
the additional capacity provided by the quota share relationship with olympus and the million cash contribution it received from onebeacon in december enhanced folksamerica s ability to provide significant reinsurance capacity in  a period of strengthening prices 
folksamerica s significant increase in premiums for versus was primarily attributable to additional writings across most lines in response to improved terms and conditions in the overall reinsurance market 
folksamerica s losses and lae include million  net of reinstatement premiums  related to european floods during the third quarter of as well as million of additional losses related to the attacks

these losses  with exception of the those relating to the attacks  are covered under the imagine cover  and were partially offset by amortization of the deferred gain related to retroactive reinsurance see below 
during  folksamerica recorded gross losses from the attacks of approximately million  or approximately million net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement costs 
this loss represented approximately six points of its statutory combined ratio 
folksamerica also established a reserve of million for enron related surety exposures in folksamerica s losses and lae included million in losses related to prior accident years representing i higher than expected reported losses in folksamerica s property excess line and ii an increase in reserves related to losses arising from the portfolios acquired from the usf re and risk capital

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the financial statements presented herein include all adjustments considered necessary by management to fairly present the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of white mountains 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in the current year presentation of financial information  certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation 
white mountains has completed numerous significant transactions during the periods presented that have affected the comparability of the financial statement information presented herein 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to loss and lae reserves  purchase accounting and related deferred credits and goodwill  reinsurance transactions and its pension benefit obligations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management believes that its critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity 
loss and loss adjustment expenses insurance white mountains insurance subsidiaries establish loss and lae that are estimates of amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses in the future for insured events that have already occurred 
reinsurance is an arrangement in which a reinsurance company a reinsurer contractually agrees to indemnify an insurance company for all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the insurance company 
white mountains establishes estimates of amounts recoverable from its reinsurers in a manner consistent with the claim liability covered by the reinsurance contracts  net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts 
net insurance loss reserves represent loss and lae reserves reduced by reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 
in a broad sense  loss and lae reserves have two components i case reserves  which are reserves established within the claims function for claims that have been reported to white mountains and ii ibnr 
case reserves are estimated based on the experience and knowledge of claims staff regarding the nature and potential cost of each claim 
white mountains claims staff periodically adjusts case reserves as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
generally accepted actuarial methods are used to project estimates of ibnr 
actuaries use a variety of statistical and analytical methods to determine estimates of ibnr  which are based  in part  on historical claim reporting and payment patterns 
in estimating ibnr  actuaries consider all available information  including historical experience  changes in business mix  coverage limits  changes in claims handling practices  pricing  reinsurance protections  inflation and the effects of legal  social and legislative trends on future claim payments 
management exercises judgment based upon its knowledge of its business  review of the outcome of actuarial studies  historical experience and other factors to record an estimate it believes reflects white mountains expected ultimate unpaid loss and lae and related reinsurance recoverables 
regardless of the techniques used  estimation is inherent in the process of establishing unpaid loss reserves and related reinsurance recoverables as of any given date 
uncertainties in projecting ultimate claim amounts are magnified by the time lag between when a claim actually occurs and when it becomes reported and settled 
this time lag is sometimes referred to as the claim tail 
the claim tail for most property coverages is typically short 
the claim tail for liability coverages  such as general and product liability  directors and officers liability  medical malpractice and workers compensation  can be especially long as claims are often reported or settled years after the related occurrences 
during the claims reporting and settlement period  additional facts regarding claims and trends become known which may cause white mountains to adjust its estimate of its ultimate net loss and lae liability 
loss and lae reserve estimates at onebeacon are subject to additional uncertainty as a consequence of numerous factors that occurred prior to white mountains acquisition of onebeacon on june  as previously discussed  onebeacon is the result of the merger of the us operations of general accident and commercial union  two companies with different underwriting and claims management philosophies and practices 
beginning in the mid s  and continuing through the merger  the subsequent operational integration of general accident plc and commercial union plc and the acquisition  onebeacon experienced an environment of significant change  both in its business and operations 
generally accepted actuarial techniques used to estimate reserves rely in large degree on projecting historical trends such as patterns of claim development ie  reported claims and paid losses into the future 
accordingly  estimating reserves becomes more uncertain if business mix  case reserve adequacy  claims payment rates  coverage limits and other factors change over time 
the breadth and depth of the business and operational changes that occurred at onebeacon led to a wider range in the reserve estimates produced by a variety of actuarial loss reserving techniques  especially those that rely upon consistent claim development patterns  and introduced greater complexity to the judgments required to be made by management in determining the impact of the business and operational changes on the development patterns used to estimate reserves 
onebeacon s net loss and lae reserves by line of business at december  and were as follows december  net loss and lae reserves by line of business in millions workers compensation personal automobile liability multiple peril  commercial automobile liability general liability homeowners farmowners other total   in establishing reserves  the company s actuaries apply various generally accepted actuarial techniques to identify a reasonable range of reserve estimates 
for onebeacon  the range of reserve estimates as of december  was evaluated to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the actuarial methods applied against onebeacon s historical claims experience data 
reserves reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements represent management s best estimate of reserves based on a composite of the results of the various actuarial methods  as well as consideration of known facts and trends 
management believes that onebeacon s reserves are reasonably stated  however  ultimate loss and lae for past accident years may deviate  perhaps materially  from the amounts currently reflected in the reserve balance 
further adverse development  if any  would impact onebeacon s future results of operations

summary of operations by segment in item of this report 
reinsurance white mountains reinsurance subsidiaries establish loss and lae reserves that are estimates of amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses in the future for reinsured events that have already occurred 
white mountains reinsurance subsidiaries also obtain reinsurance whereby another reinsurer contractually agrees to indemnify white mountains for all or a portion of the reinsurance risks underwritten by white mountains 
such arrangements  where one reinsurer provides reinsurance to another reinsurer  are usually referred to as retrocessional reinsurance arrangements 
white mountains establishes estimates of amounts recoverable from retrocessional reinsurance in a manner consistent with the loss and lae liability associated with reinsurance contracts offered to its customers the ceding companies  net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts 
net reinsurance loss reserves represent loss and lae reserves reduced by retrocessional reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 
reinsurance loss and lae reserve estimates reflect the judgement of both the ceding companies and white mountains  based on the experience and knowledge of their respective claims personnel  regarding the nature and value of the claims 
the ceding companies may periodically adjust the amount of the case reserves as additional information becomes known or partial payments are made 
upon notification of a loss from a ceding company  white mountains establishes case reserves  including lae reserves  based upon white mountains share of the amount of reserves established by the ceding company and white mountains independent evaluation of the loss 
in cases where available information indicates that reserves established by the ceding company are inadequate  white mountains establishes reserves in excess of its share of the reserves established by the ceding company 
white mountains uses a combination of actuarial methods to determine its reinsurance ibnr reserves 
these methods fall into two general categories methods by which ultimate claims are estimated based upon historical patterns of paid and reported claim development experienced by white mountains  as supplemented by reported industry patterns  and methods in which the level of white mountains reinsurance ibnr claim reserves are established based upon the application of expected loss ratios relative to earned premium by accident year  line of business and type of reinsurance written 
the estimation of net reinsurance loss and lae reserves is subject to the same factors as the estimation of insurance loss and lae reserves 
in addition to those factors which give rise to inherent uncertainties in establishing insurance loss and lae reserves  the claim tail for reinsurers is further extended because claims are first reported through one or more intermediary insurers or reinsurers 
reserves reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements represent management s best estimate of reserves based on a composite of the results of various actuarial methods  as well as consideration of known facts and trends 
as a result of the uncertainties in the determination of insurance and reinsurance loss and lae reserves and related reinsurance recoverables described above  white mountains actual net loss and lae paid may deviate  perhaps materially  from estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
changes to prior year net reserves are booked in the current accounting period in accordance with gaap 
accordingly  if net loss and lae reserves develop adversely from amounts currently established  future results of operations would be negatively impacted 
reinsurance transactions white mountains insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries enter into ceded reinsurance contracts from time to time to protect their businesses from losses due to poor risk diversification  to manage their operating leverage ratios and to limit ultimate losses arising from catastrophic events 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policies 
amounts related to reinsurance contracts are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to the solvency and willingness to pay of the reinsurers 
the company is selective in regard to its reinsurers  placing reinsurance principally with those reinsurers with a strong financial condition  industry ratings and underwriting ability 
management monitors the financial condition and ratings of its reinsurers on an ongoing basis

pension and post retirement medical plans white mountains accounts for its pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and accounts for its retiree medical plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
require that the cost of pension retiree medical benefits be accrued over the period during which an employee provides service 
through december   onebeacon provided pension and retiree medical plans for the benefit of its employees 
the majority of onebeacon s pension and retiree medical plans were curtailed in the fourth quarter of the onebeacon pension plan will no longer add new participants or increase benefits for existing participants 
non vested participants already in the plan will continue to vest during their employment with onebeacon  this effectively causes the projected benefit obligation to equal the accumulated benefit obligation 
retirees are also eligible for medical benefits if they meet certain age and service requirements 
however  due to the curtailment  the plan will no longer accept new participants after a transition period ending may  the majority of retiree medical costs are capped at defined dollar amounts  with retirees contributing the remainder 
the projected benefit obligation as of a particular date represents the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed by the plan s benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to that date 
therefore  future cash payments from pension and retiree medical plans are discounted using a discount rate based on published investment grade  long term corporate bond yields 
many of the factors which are used to determine a plan s projected benefit obligation as of a particular date and the cost of pension retiree medical benefits for a particular period are dependent upon future events  such as how long the employee and any survivors live  how many years of service the employee is expected to render and the employee s compensation in the years immediately before retirement or termination 
accordingly  the effects of such future factors are estimated 
further  since the projected benefit obligation and the periodic cost of pension retiree medical benefits are based on actuarial present values  they are also sensitive to changes in the discount rate used to determine such amounts 
a hypothetical increase in the discount rate would result in a decrease in pension and retiree medical projected benefit obligations of approximately million and million  respectively  and would result in an increase in onebeacon s total pretax pension post retirement expense of approximately 
million 
a hypothetical decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase in pension and retiree medical projected benefit obligations of approximately million and million  respectively  and would result in a decrease in onebeacon s total pretax pension post retirement expense of approximately 
million 
additionally  the rate of return that is assumed on plan assets affects onebeacon s pension expense during a particular period 
since the retiree medical plan is unfunded  it is not affected by changes in the rate of return assumption 
onebeacon performed an analysis of expected long term rates of return based on the allocation of its pension plan assets as of both december  and december  to develop expected rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator 
a range of returns was developed based both on forecasts and on broad market historical benchmarks for expected return  correlation  and volatility for each asset class 
although the expected investment return assumption is long term in nature  the range of reasonable returns has dropped over the past few years as a consequence of lower inflation and lower bond yields 
as a result of the most recent review  for onebeacon has reduced its expected return on its pension assets to  from used in at december   greater than half of the plan assets were invested in fixed maturity securities  one third in equities and the remainder in cash  cash equivalents and convertible securities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would result in a pretax change in onebeacon s pension expense or income as the case may be for of approximately million 
purchase accounting and related deferred credits and goodwill as of december   white mountains had unamortized deferred credits and goodwill of million and million  respectively 
deferred credits represent the excess of the fair value of the net assets over the purchase price paid 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of companies acquired 
these deferred credits and goodwill resulted from white mountains pre july  acquisition activities which were accounted for in accordance with the treatment of a purchase business combination under accounting principles board apb no 
 business combinations 
apb no 
calls for the net assets of the operations acquired to be recorded by white mountains at their fair values on the date of acquisition 
all acquisitions occurring subsequent to july  were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
under this newly issued accounting standard  white mountains recognized a million extraordinary gain during relating to two acquisitions and fully recognized its existing unamortized deferred credit balance of million on january  as a change in accounting principle 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  white mountains will amortize its existing and prospective goodwill only when the asset acquired is deemed to have been impaired rather than systematically over a perceived period of benefit

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk white mountains consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risk 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and other relevant market rates and prices 
due to white mountains sizable balances of interest rate sensitive instruments  market risk can have a significant effect on white mountains consolidated financial position 
interest rate risk fixed maturity portfolio 
in connection with the company s consolidated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  white mountains invests in interest rate sensitive securities  primarily debt securities 
white mountains strategy is to purchase fixed maturity investments that are attractively priced in relation to perceived credit risks 
white mountains fixed maturity investments are held as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  whereby these investments are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with net unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax in a separate component of common shareholders equity 
white mountains generally manages its interest rate risk associated with its portfolio of fixed maturity investments by monitoring the average duration of the portfolio  which allows white mountains to achieve an adequate yield without subjecting the portfolio to an unreasonable level of interest rate risk 
white mountains fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of primarily investment grade corporate securities  us government and agency securities  municipal obligations and mortgage backed securities eg  those receiving a rating from the national association of insurance commissioners of or 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of fixed maturity investments  respectively 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
indebtedness 
white mountains utilized a significant amount of variable rate debt financing the bank facility and the seller note in connection with the acquisition 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates will translate into increases and decreases in the future interest expense associated with this indebtedness although the carrying value of such liabilities will not be affected 
at december   white mountains also had million in fixed rate indebtedness outstanding which was prepaid in connection with the acquisition by the debt escrow transaction  therefore  its fair value is not subject to future changes in prevailing interest rates 
during white mountains entered into a ten year  million notional interest rate swap and three separate three year interest rate swaps at an aggregate million notional with two large financial institutions 
the interest rate swaps were undertaken to achieve a fixed interest rate on a portion of the bank facility 
pursuant to sfas no 
 these contracts are carried at fair value in other investments on the balance sheet which constituted an obligation by white mountains of million at december  with changes in their fair value reported directly through the income statement as they do not qualify for hedge accounting since their duration is dissimilar to that of the bank facility 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in market interest rates on white mountains fixed maturity portfolio and the interest rate swaps 
fair value at december  assumed change in relevant interest rate estimated fair value after change in interest rate after tax increase decrease in carrying value dollars in millions fixed maturity investments  bp decrease  bp decrease  bp increase  bp increase  pension fixed maturity investments bp decrease bp decrease bp increase bp increase interest rate swaps bp decrease bp decrease bp increase bp increase the relevant interest rate for the assumed change in white mountains interest rate swaps is predicated upon assumed changes in the three year or the ten year us treasury yield  depending on the duration of the swap contract 
equity price risk the carrying values of white mountains common equity securities and its other investments are based on quoted market prices or management s estimates of fair value which is based  in part  on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
market prices of common equity securities  in general  are subject to fluctuations which could cause the amount to be realized upon sale or exercise of the instruments to differ significantly from the current reported value 
the fluctuations may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative price of alternative investments  general market conditions and supply and demand imbalances for a particular security 
foreign currency exchange rates a small portion of white mountains assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies 
net unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses are reported  after tax  as a net amount in a separate component of common shareholders equity 
changes in the values of these assets and liabilities due to currency fluctuations  after tax  are reported on the income statement as a component of other comprehensive income 
white mountains assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are not material
