item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of point of care  high performance  all digital ultrasound imaging systems for use in a variety of clinical applications and settings 
our proprietary technologies have enabled us to design point of care diagnostic ultrasound systems that combine all digital  high resolution imaging with advanced features and capabilities traditionally found on cart based ultrasound systems 
we believe that the portability  high quality and cost effectiveness of our products are expanding existing markets and will create new markets for ultrasound imaging by bringing ultrasound out of the imaging center to the point of care such as the patient s bedside or the physician s examining table 
the size and complexity of traditional ultrasound systems typically compel physicians to refer patients to a highly trained sonographer employed by an imaging center  such as a hospital s radiology department 
by providing ultrasound at the primary point of care  our easy to use systems can eliminate delays associated with the referral process and enable physicians to use ultrasound more frequently and in a wider variety of clinical settings 
this increased accessibility creates the potential for enhanced patient care through earlier diagnosis of diseases and conditions 
we currently focus on six key market segments radiology  obstetrics and gynecology  emergency medicine  surgery  cardiology and vascular medicine 
our current products include the sonosite plus  for general ultrasound imaging  the sonoheart elite  specifically configured for cardiovascular applications  and our newest products  the ilook  intended for quick look diagnostics in areas such as emergency medicine  radiology  surgery or intensive care  and the ilook  designed to provide visual imaging for physicians and nurses while performing vascular access procedures 
our sonosite plus and sonoheart elite products are used together with any of our seven interchangeable handheld components  or transducers  that are designed for specific clinical applications 
our ilook products each have a single transducer for specific clinical applications 
we were formerly a division of atl ultrasound  inc  or atl 
on april   we were spun off as an independent  publicly owned washington corporation to further the development and commercialization of point of care  high performance  all digital ultrasound imaging systems 
atl retained no ownership in us following the spin off 
we entered into a technology transfer and license agreement with atl pursuant to which we took ownership of certain ultrasound technology developed as part of a government grant and also patent rights  which had been established or were being pursued for that technology 
as part of this agreement  we also entered into a cross license whereby we have the exclusive right to use certain atl technology existing on april  or developed by atl during the three year period following april  in ultrasound systems weighing pounds or less  and atl has the exclusive right to use our technology existing on april  or developed by us during the same three year period in ultrasound systems weighing more than pounds 
on april   this cross license becomes nonexclusive and  except for the patented technology of each party  extends to all ultrasound systems regardless of weight 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  warranty obligations  service contracts  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon specific customer risks and a general provision based upon historical trends 
losses can be difficult to anticipate 
for example  in  we wrote off approximately  of our argentine receivables due to adverse economic conditions in argentina 
an increase in losses beyond those expected by management would reduce earnings when they become known 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on products and accessories when goods are shipped under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for service contracts  revenue is recognized over the term of the contract 
sales discounts are recorded as a reduction in revenue 
in connection with sales to certain specific international customers  we sometimes conclude that full collection of the related accounts receivable is not reasonably assured due to extended payment terms or the financial condition of our customer and  consequently  we do not recognize revenue or cost of revenue at the time of title transfer 
in instances where collection is not reasonably assured  revenue and cost of revenue are recorded when cash is received 
additionally  in cases of nonstandard delivery and acceptance criteria  we do not recognize revenue at shipment  but rather when the delivery and acceptance criteria have been satisfied 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out method 
included in our inventories balance are demonstration products used by our sales representatives and marketing department and items that have been shipped to customers for which revenue recognition requirements have not been met 
cost adjustments are recorded for obsolete material  earlier generation products and used product held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product  if necessary to reduce their carrying values to amounts not lower than that which will result in approximately normal profit margins upon sale 
inventory items for which title has passed to customers are evaluated for recoverability based on the same process we use to evaluate collection of accounts receivable 
we make judgments regarding the carrying value of our inventory based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions  consumer demand and reimbursement criteria in the medical community 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to write down the cost of our inventory 
warranty expense 
we accrue estimated warranty expenses at the time of sale for costs expected to be incurred under our product warranties 
this provision for warranty expenses is made based upon our historical experience and management s judgment 
we have limited history with our products 
any unexpected increase in defects would result in an increase in warranty expense and a reduction in earnings 
results of operations revenue revenue increased to million in  compared to million in and million in approximately of the increase was in the united states 
the increase in revenue in compared to was primarily due to an increase in sales in the united states resulting from having a fully staffed direct sales force for an entire year  our new product introductions and our increased average selling price 
sales representatives increased productivity as they became more experienced and were assisted by clinical application specialists 
these specialists performed product demonstrations and customer support  enabling sales representatives to focus on sales calls 
additionally  the average selling price per system increased due to an increase in sales of higher priced features 
approximately of the increase was in europe  where we opened two new sales offices in germany and spain in and had a full year of operation in the united kingdom and france compared to the prior year 
the increase in revenue in compared to was primarily due to an increase in sales in the united states resulting from an increase in the number of direct sales representatives to at the end of  compared to at the end of the increase was also due to an increased average selling price 
us revenues increased to million in  compared to million in  due to the increase in us direct sales representatives  our new product introductions and our increased average selling prices 
us revenues increased to million in  compared to million in  due to the increase in us direct sales representatives and increased average selling prices 
revenue from japan decreased to million in from million in primarily due to the timing of orders received from our distributor in japan and the delay in approval of our new products 
the decrease of revenue in japan to million in from million in was due to initial distributor orders received in the prior year 
revenue from europe  africa and the middle east increased to million in from million in primarily due to an increase in direct sales in the united kingdom and france along with sales from our recently established direct sales operations in germany and spain 
the increase to million in from million in was primarily due to an increase in direct sales in the united kingdom and a large multi order system sale in the first quarter of revenue from canada  australia  south and latin america and other asia increased to million in from million in primarily due to an increase in orders from our distributors in china and mexico 
revenue from canada  australia  south and latin america and other asia increased slightly to million in from million in we anticipate that revenue will increase in compared to prior years due to continued expansion of our direct selling efforts in the united states and europe  introduction of new products and product features  and the overall expansion of market awareness and acceptance of our products 
however  increased competition may impact the extent of the increase in our anticipated growth in revenue 
we currently face competition from larger companies that manufacture cart based and portable ultrasound systems and have greater financial and other resources 
some of these competitors are introducing highly portable and point of care ultrasound products 
in  we do not anticipate any increase in our revenue from japan due to the changes in the distribution network of our partner  olympus  in the first half of the year 
additionally  regulatory approval of our new products in japan may experience delays  which could impact our anticipated revenue 
gross margin gross margin increased to in  compared to in and in the increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of direct sales compared with distributor sales  increased average selling prices due to the sale of higher priced features  and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
the increase in gross margin in from was primarily due to a combination of increased selling prices and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
the increased average selling prices resulted from an increase in the number of transducers and accessories sold with each system and an increase in the percentage of our direct sales compared with distributor sales 
costs as a percentage of sales decreased in because costs on a per unit basis decreased as our production volumes increased 
we expect gross margin in to increase slightly from gross margin achieved in nevertheless  increased competition from existing and new competitors in the highly portable ultrasound system market could result in lower average realized prices and could lower our gross margin 
our gross margin can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based on the mix of business between direct and distributor sales and our product and accessories sales mixes 
changes in our cost of inventory also may impact our gross margin 
included in our inventories are demonstration products  refurbished products and products held by our customers  which are valued by us at amounts expected to result in a normal margin upon sale 
if market conditions change or the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to write down the cost of our inventory resulting in a negative impact on gross margins 
additionally  we rely on our sales forecasts by product to determine production volume 
to the extent our sales forecasts or product mix estimates are inaccurate  we may produce excess inventory or experience inventory shortages  which may result in an increase in our costs of goods sold and a decrease in our gross margin 
operating expenses research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in research and development expenses decreased in compared to primarily due to a reduction in product development costs after the completion and introduction of the sonoheart elite and ilook products during the first nine months of the increase in research and development expenses compared to was primarily due to increased activities surrounding the final design  verification and validation of the plus platforms and related transducers and continued engineering design and development of new products  including the sonoheart elite system and its features which was released in march we anticipate that research and development expenses will be level in as compared to however  should our competitors develop products with features that equal or exceed the features that exist in our products  we may incur higher than anticipated research and development costs in order to accelerate existing programs and compete more effectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in and million in of the million increase in expenses in compared to  approximately was related to our direct sales activities in the united states  where for the first time we had a fully operational sales force for an entire year 
approximately of the increase was related to the addition of clinical application specialists in the united states  who assisted sales representatives with product demonstrations and customer support 
approximately of the increase was related to our direct sales activities in europe where we opened two new sales office and increased headcount in our two existing offices 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in compared to was primarily due to an increase in direct selling expenses in the united states and europe 
us direct selling expenses increased by million to million  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to costs associated with the increase in the number of sales representatives and sales management 
our expansion into europe in resulted in additional expenses due to the addition of our direct selling operation 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in marketing expenses due to market research expenses incurred at the end of that were not incurred in we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in will increase primarily due to increased expenses in europe resulting from the expansion of our european direct sales offices 
general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the increases in general and administrative expenses in and were related primarily to supporting our business growth and to legal expenses incurred to defend our intellectual property rights 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in due to increased insurance  accounting and legal expenses in addition to general expenses to support the growth of our infrastructure 
we may incur additional substantial legal expenses as we continue to defend our patent rights in the existing patent litigation 
in addition  we may incur unanticipated legal expenses if we become involved in any new litigation 
other income loss for other income and loss  we reported income of  in compared to a loss of  in the increase in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in equity investment losses from our joint venture in china 
in  we began the process of terminating our joint venture in china  which we expect to have completed in along with the formation of a joint venture with a new partner that has greater financial and marketing resources 
we reported other loss of  in  compared to other income of million in the decrease in compared to was primarily due to decreased interest income of million as a result of our decreased average investment balance and lower interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities used cash of million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease in cash used in compared with was primarily due to a reduction in our net loss of million 
the decrease in cash used was also due to changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable  both of which were substantially offset by the change in inventories 
the effect on cash from the change in accounts receivable improved in compared to primarily due to improved collection efforts 
accounts payable increased primarily due to the timing of payments  increased inventory purchases and our overall growth 
inventories increased to support increased business activity 
the decrease in cash used in operations as compared with was primarily due to a reduction in inventories  which related to our consumption of raw material that we obtained from atl as part of the transfer of the manufacturing operations in house  a reduction in our net loss and an increase in deferred liabilities resulting from extended service contracts 
these items were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable due to significant sales volume in december as compared to the prior year and a reduction in accounts payable primarily related to payments to atl for the raw material inventory noted above 
investing activities used cash of million in  compared to cash provided of million in and cash used of million in the cash used in was primarily due to net purchases of investment securities 
the cash provided in was primarily due to net sales maturities of investment securities 
we anticipate continuing to use cash to invest in high quality investment instruments in  the extent of which will be dependent upon the interest rate environment during the year and the timing of cash flows from our operations during the year 
financing activities provided cash of million in  compared to million in and million in in may  we received net proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share 
in august  we received net proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share 
we anticipate that cash used in operations will decrease in compared to primarily due to anticipated decreases in our net loss 
this decrease will be dependent upon our ability to successfully sell our products  collect our receivables  control our inventories and manage our expenses 
we believe that our existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements through nevertheless  we may experience an increased need for additional cash due to any significant decline in our revenues or gross margins  any delay or inability to collect accounts receivable  any acquisition or strategic investment in another business  any significant increase in expenditures as a result of expansion of our sales and marketing infrastructure  our manufacturing capability or our product development activities  any significant increase in our sales and marketing expenditures as a result of our introduction of new products  and any significant increase in expenditures related to the neutrino patent infringement litigation 
additionally  we have the following contractual obligations and commitments as of december  operating leases capital leases total in thousands other commitments as part of our agreements with our suppliers  suppliers may procure resources and material expected to be used for the manufacture of our product in accordance with our production schedule provided to them 
in the event these items are not used in the quantities submitted as part of the production schedule or material becomes obsolete as a result of production timing  material changes or design changes  we may be responsible for compensating our suppliers for these procurements 
as part of obtaining our lease for our current facility  we were required to deposit approximately  representing restricted cash with our bank 
also  we were required to maintain a deposit of approximately  with our bank in the united kingdom as security for payment of customs and duties charges 
both amounts are included in other long term assets 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
statement no 
retains many of the fundamental provisions of statement no 
and provides a single method of accounting for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we adopted the provisions of statement no 
for the fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of this statement for long lived assets held for use did not have any impact on our financial statements 
the provisions of the statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities 
therefore  we cannot determine the potential future effects that the adoption of this statement for assets held for sale or other disposal will have on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
statement no 
nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between statement no 
and issue no 
relates to the recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
statement no 
requires that a liability be recognized for those costs only when the liability is incurred  that is  when it meets the definition of a liability in the fasb s conceptual framework 
in contrast  under issue no 
 a company recognized a liability for an exit cost when it committed to an exit plan 
statement no 
also establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities 
the statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  although earlier application is encouraged 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin clarifies the requirements of statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to a guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
for certain guarantees issued after december   fin requires a guarantor to recognize  upon issuance of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee 
guarantees issued prior to january   are not subject to liability recognition  but are subject to expanded disclosure requirements 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables with respect to determining when and how to allocate revenue from sales with multiple deliverables 
the eitf consensus provides a framework for determining when and how to allocate revenue from sales with multiple deliverables based on a determination of whether the multiple deliverables qualify to be accounted for as separate units of accounting 
the consensus is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect that the adoption of this consensus will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  which provides for alternative methods to transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock options in accordance with provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  sfas requires disclosure of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
we adopted the annual disclosure provisions of sfas in the financial statements for our fiscal year ended december  and will adopt the interim disclosure requirements beginning in the first quarter of the transition provisions of sfas are currently not applicable to us as we continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
variable interest entities often are created for a single specified purpose  for example  to facilitate securitization  leasing  hedging  research and development  or other transactions or arrangements 
formerly consolidation of certain special purpose entities in its draft form  this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  defines what these variable interest entities are and provides guidelines on how to identity them and also on how an enterprise should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
generally  fin applies to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
for existing variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february   the provision of this interpretation will apply no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  currently  we do not have any variable interest entities  and we do not expect that the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk relating to changes in interest rates  which could adversely affect the value of our investments in marketable securities 
as of december   our portfolio consisted of million of interest bearing debt securities with maturities of less than one year and million of interest bearing debt securities with maturities of more than one year 
our intent is to hold these securities until maturity  but we have classified them as available for sale in the event of unanticipated cash needs 
the interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and related earnings for from a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk except for sales transacted by our wholly owned subsidiaries  we transact all our sales in us dollars  or usds  therefore  the obligations of many of our international customers are in usds 
our exposure to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies relates primarily to the strengthening of the usd against the local currency of our international customers  which may impact our ability to collect amounts owed by our international customers 
as of december   of our outstanding accounts receivable balance was from international customers  of which  or approximately million was denominated in a currency other than usds 
our distributor in japan was indebted to us for approximately million  representing of our outstanding accounts receivable balance 
total sales for the year ended december  denominated in a currency other than usds were approximately million  or of total consolidated revenues 
the british pound and the euro represented the majority of financial transactions executed in a currency not denominated in usds 
a change in exchange rates compared to the usd of would not have a significant impact on our statement of financial position or results of operations 
historically  the impact on us of changes in exchange rates compared to the usd has been insignificant 
we regularly review our receivable positions in foreign countries for any indication that collection may be at risk 
in addition  we utilize letters of credit where they are warranted in order to mitigate our collection risk 
as of december   we did not have any foreign currency hedging contracts
