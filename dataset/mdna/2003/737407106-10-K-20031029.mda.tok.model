this exclusive technology platform intensifies the action at the tip of the catheter  which doubles the clot removal rate and triples the treatable vessel size compared to other available mechanical thrombectomy devices on the market today

in foreign markets  where public sector funds are more crucial for hospital operation  euro devaluations generated higher public sector deficits  which  in turn  forced reductions in hospital procedure and equipment budgets 
in japan  the company has decided to independently pursue an alternative regulatory strategy that will utilize the company s us coronary clinical trial results and extensive body of published clinical studies which is expected to result in regulatory approval and satisfactory reimbursement for the angiojet system with the xmi catheter in treating coronary thrombus
