the bank s conversion to a state chartered commercial bank in january is part of its strategic plan to increase the financial products and services it offers to small business and retail customers and to expand into growing markets in its region 
management believes the transition has been responsible for the renewed growth in lending and certificates of deposit 
an important element of this strategy has been to develop a bank wide service and sales culture emphas izing expanded account relationships 
to achieve this goal  the bank has increased the number of associates in banking centers  relationship bankers  business development officers  stockbrokers  and loan officers with experience in commercial lending 
the strategy also involves greater emphasis on originating commercial and consumer loans  which generally have higher rates and shorter terms than residential mortgage loans 
the bank has adjusted its lending practices and risk management policies to reflect the greater risk involved with commercial and consumer lending

offsetting the decline in securities  net loans including loans held for sale increased million from june  to million at december  residential mortgage loans decreased by million during the period as declining market interest rates caused an increase in family refinancing activity into fixed rate  secondary market loan products

other sources of income such as trust  and other customer transaction fees also increased during the period by  non interest expense non interest expense increased by  or duri ng the six month period ended december  compared to the same period in factors impacting non interest expense inclu ded an increase in staffing levels and a change in accounting rules in which goodwill amortization expense from acquisitions is no longer recorded 
moderate increases in non interest expense are likely going forward as the bank anticipates future remodeling and expansion of its banking centers in surrounding areas 
non interest expense levels are often measured using an efficiency ratio non interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non interest income 
a lower efficiency ratio is indicat ive of higher bank performance 
the bank s efficiency ratio improved to in compared to in employee compensation and benefits increased  or for the increase reflects growth in the overall staffing level from full time equivalent employees at december  to at decemb er  the bank s continued emphasis on building its commercial and retail staff to reflect its commercial bank philosophy was t he largest contributing factor

the increase includes inflationary salary adjustments and reflects growth in the overall staffing level from at june   to at june  additional staffing was required to achieve a new s trategic plan adopted by the bank in to develop a bank wide service and sales culture 
the plan emphasizes expanding account relationships  which requires increasing the number of associates in banking centers  relationship bankers  business development off icers  stockbrokers  and loan officers 
the transition has been responsible for much of the renewed growth in lending and certificat es of deposit

periodic provisions to the allowance are made as needed 
an appropriate level of the general allowance is determined base d on the application of loss percentages to graded loans by categories 
in addition  specific reserves are established for indi vidual loans when deemed necessary 
the amount of the provision for loan losses necessary to maintain an adequate allowance is based upon an analysis of various factors  including changes in lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  collection  ch arge off and recovery history  changes in national and local economic business conditions and developments  changes in the characte ristics of the portfolio  ability and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due  non accrual and classified loans  troubled debt restructuring and other loan modifications  and results of regulatory examinati ons 
the methodology for allocating the allowance for loan and lease losses has t aken into account the bank s strategic plan to increase its emphasis on commercial and consumer lending 
the bank increased the am ount of the reserve allocated to commercial loans and consumer loans in response to the growth of the commercial and consumer loan portfolios and management s recognition of the higher risks and loan losses in these lending areas 
the indirect consumer loan p rogram was initiated in and is comprised of new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicle loans originated on the behalf of the bank by a select group of auto dealers within the service area 
the indirect loan program involves a greater degr ee of risk and is evaluated quarterly and monitored by the board of directors 
in light of the greater charge offs from indirect consumer loans compared to direct consumer loans  proportionally more of the allowance for consumer loans is allocated for i ndirect loans than direct loans 
as the indirect loan program has evolved  dealer analysis and underwriting standards have be en refined to improve the loan loss experience of the program 
estimating the reserve is a continuous process 
in this regard  t he executive loan committee continues to monitor the performance of indirect consumer loans as well as the bank s other loan product s and updates its estimates as the evidence warrants

the regulations provide for three categories of classified loans substandard  doubtful and loss 
the reg ulations also contain a special mention and a specific allowance category 
special mention is defined as loans that do not currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potent ial weaknesses deserving management s close attention 
specific allowance is defined as loans for which the bank has designated spec ific reserves to cover specifically identified losses 
assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the institution to establ ish general allowances for loan losses 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  the insured institution must either establish specified allowances for loan losses in the amount of of the portion of the asset classified loss  or charge off such amount 
at december   on the basis of management s review of the bank s loan portfolio  the bank had million of assets classified substandard   classified as doubtful   classified as specific allowance  million classifie d as special mention and  of assets classified as loss as compared to million    million and  at ju ne  classified loan ranges of estimated loss are as follows substandard to  doubtful to  loss  special mention to  and specific allowance 
the bank additionally provides a reserv e estimate for incurred losses in non classified loans ranging from 
to 
allowance estimates are developed by the bank in consultation with regulatory authorities  actual loss experience and peer group loss experience and are adjusted for current econ omic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk of the bank s loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of certain restructured loans where interest rat e or other terms have been renegotiated  loans on which interest is no longer accrued  real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed assets 
the bank does not have any loans greater than days past due still on accrual 
all loans considered impaire d under sfas are included in non performing loans 
loans are considered impaired if full principal or interest payments are not anticipated in accordance with the contractual loan terms 
impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected future c ash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent loans are reviewed on a regular basis and normal collection procedures are implemented when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan 
if the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds days and i s not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower  the bank institut es measures to remedy the default  including commencing a foreclosure action 
consumer loans generally are charged off when a loan i s deemed uncollectible by management and any available collateral has been disposed of 
commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies are handled on an individual basis by management with the advice of the bank s legal counsel 
the bank anticipates that the increase in non performing real estate loans will continue due to the growth of the bank s loan portfolio 
interest income on loans is recognized on the accrual basis except for tho se loans in a non accrual of income status 
the accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when management bel ieves  after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts that the borrowers financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful  typically after the loan becomes days delinquent 
when interest accrual is discontinu ed  interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received 
real estate acquired by the bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed in li eu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicles acquired by the bank as a result of foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets until they are sold 
when such property is acquired it is recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance of the related loan or its fair market value 
a ny write down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses

liquidity is managed by retaining sufficient liquid assets such as cash and cash equivalents  interest bearing deposits  principal and interest payments from loans and securities 
if large certificate depositors shift to the bank s competitors or the stock market in response to interest rate changes  the bank has the ability to replenish them through alternativ e funding sources 
while the bank can use a number of funding sources to meet liquidity requirements  fhlb borrowings remain a mate rial component of management s balance sheet strategy

since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total co mmitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit represent conditional commitments issued by the b ank to guarantee the performance of a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing these letters of credit is essentially the sam e as the risk involved in issuing loan commitments and extending credit 
the bank obtained letters of credit from the fhlb to be used to collateralize public deposits 
these letters of credit are secured by a blanket pledge of eligible one to four family residential mortgage loans 
lease commitments represent the total future minimum lease payments under nonca ncelable operating leases 
the corporation s mortgage banking activities include commitments to extend cr edit  primarily representing fixed rate mortgage loans 
these commitments are generally for a period of to days and are at ma rket rates 
to deliver these loans to the secondary market  the corporation has entered into best efforts forward sales contracts on a loan for loan basis 
impact of inflation changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepa red in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operati ng results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the bank has an asset and liability structure that is essentially monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the bank s performance than the effects of general le vels of inflation 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates  and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on the ba nk s loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  the bank manages its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset a nd liability management activities within guidelines established by its asset liability committee alco 
the alco  which includes senior management representatives  has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability ma nagement polices of the corporation 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of m arket fluctuations in interest rates 
the alco  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implem ent appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be the bank s most significant marke t risk 
the bank utilizes an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest inco me sensitivity 
potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income are then evalua ted 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
assumptions b ased on the historical behavior of the bank s deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorpora ted into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future ne t interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
the bank s interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive at december  compared to being liability sensitive at june  given a sustained basis point decrease in rates  the bank s base ne t interest income would decrease by an estimated at december  compared to an increase of at june  given a basis point increase in interest rates the bank s base net interest income would increase by an estimated at decem ber  compared to a decrease of at june  the interest sensitivity of the corporation at any point in time will be affe cted by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities as well as their relative pricing schedules 
it is also influenced by market interest rates  decay rates and prepayment speed assumptions 
our previous disclosures of sensitivity included growth rates for loans and deposits 
to provide improved period to period comparisons  the tabl es are presented without these growth estimates 
as demonstrated by the june  and december  sensitivity tables pres ented below  the corporation is transitioning away from a liability sensitive thrift organization to a more balanced  asset sensitiv e commercial bank institution 
the current reporting period improvement in the corporation s asset sensitivity is a result of chang es in the investment portfolio to a greater extent than loan products 
while lending practices have shifted emphasis to shorter term  variable rate commercial and consumer loans  that impact will be evidenced in smaller degrees over time 
the more dramatic contr ibution to sensitivity over the june period results from the redemption of longer term investments which were reinvested in ov ernight accounts that immediately reprice during rate shocks 
the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate changes is prese nted based on data as of december and june  annualized to a one year period
