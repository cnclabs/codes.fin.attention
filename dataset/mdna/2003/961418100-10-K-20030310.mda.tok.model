item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following information should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in response to sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  oil and gas properties  fair value of derivative instruments  income taxes and contingencies and litigation  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we follow the sales method of accounting for oil and natural gas revenues 
under this method  revenues are recognized based on actual volumes of oil and natural gas sold to purchasers 
no receivables  payables  or unearned revenue are recorded unless a working interest owner s aggregate sales from the property exceed its share of the total reserves in place 
if such a situation arises  the parties would likely cash balance 
successful efforts accounting 
we account for our oil and natural gas operations using the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  all costs associated with property acquisition  successful exploratory wells and all development wells are capitalized 
items charged to expense generally include geological and geophysical costs  costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells and oil and natural gas production costs 
all of our oil and natural gas properties are located within the continental united states  the gulf of mexico and canada 
proved reserve estimates 
estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this report is based on estimates prepared by ryder scott company  netherland  sewell associates  inc and our engineering staff 
estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
our stockholders should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
our estimates of proved reserves directly impact depletion expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record depletion expense increases  reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices or increases in costs  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields  or property performance 
in addition  the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of our oil and gas producing properties for impairment 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
we review our long lived proved properties to be held and used whenever management judges that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable 
management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon management s outlook of future commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties 
proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment on a field by field basis  which is the lowest level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated 
impairment of goodwill 
goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill 
impairment of unproved oil and gas properties 
management periodically assesses individually significant unproved oil and gas properties for impairment  on a project by project basis 
management s assessment of the results of exploration activities  commodity price outlooks  planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects impact the amount and timing of impairment provisions 
commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts and fixed price physical contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we primarily utilize future contracts  swaps or options  which are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counterparties of high credit quality that we believe are minimal credit risks 
the oil and natural gas reference prices of these commodity derivatives contracts are based upon crude oil and natural gas futures  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices we receive 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under sfas no 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
for qualifying fair value hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is offset by related results of the hedged item in the income statement 
gains and losses on hedging instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to oil and natural gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in the consolidated statement of operations 
while such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  management believes these contracts can be utilized as an effective component of commodity price risk management  or cprm  activities 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company computes income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability approach which results in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of those assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires the recording of a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
overview we are an independent energy company engaged in oil and natural gas exploitation  acquisition and exploration activities primarily in the united states 
our reserves and production operations are concentrated in the following diversified divisions northern rocky mountains  western uinta basin  southern permian basin  mid continent and gulf coast and gulf of mexico offshore 
we focus on maintaining a balanced portfolio of lower risk  long life onshore reserves and higher margin offshore reserves to provide a diversified cash flow foundation for our exploitation  acquisition and exploration activities 
our results of operations are significantly impacted by the prices of oil and natural gas  which are volatile 
in  oil and natural gas prices increased compared to prices in oil and natural gas prices increased from per mcf and per bbl at december  to per mcf and per bbl at december  oil and natural gas production costs are composed of lease operating expense and production taxes 
lease operating expense consists of pumpers salaries  utilities  maintenance and other costs necessary to operate our producing properties 
in general  lease operating expense per unit of production is lower on our offshore properties and does not fluctuate proportionately with our production 
production taxes are assessed by applicable taxing authorities as a percentage of revenues 
however  properties located in federal waters offshore are generally not subject to production taxes 
transportation costs are comprised of costs paid to a carrier to deliver oil or natural gas to a specified delivery point 
in some cases we receive a payment from the purchases of our oil and natural gas  which is net of gas transportation costs and in other instances we pay the costs of transportation 
exploration expense consists of geological and geophysical costs  delay rentals and the cost of unsuccessful exploratory wells 
delay rentals are typically fixed in nature in the short term 
however  other exploration costs are generally discretionary and exploration activity levels are determined by a number of factors  including oil and natural gas prices  availability of funds  quantity and character of investment projects  availability of service providers and competition 
depletion of capitalized costs of producing oil and natural gas properties is computed using the units of production method based upon proved reserves 
for purposes of computing depletion  proved reserves are redetermined twice each year 
because the economic life of each producing well depends upon the assumed price for production  fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices impact the level of proved reserves 
higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves  which reduces depletion  while lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves  which increases depletion 
we assess our proved properties on a field by field basis for impairment  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties may not be recoverable 
when making such assessments  we compare the expected undiscounted future net revenues on a field by field basis with the related net capitalized costs at the end of each year 
when the net capitalized costs exceed the undiscounted future net revenues  the cost of the property is written down to fair value  which is determined using discounted future net revenues based on escalated prices 
impairments for the years ended december   and were calculated based on the following assumed oil and natural gas prices that we believe were representative of market pricing assumptions at the time at december   we assumed that oil prices in  and would be  and per barrel  respectively  and would remain constant thereafter 
we also assumed that natural gas prices in  and would be  and per mcf  respectively  and would remain constant thereafter 
at december   we assumed that oil prices in would be per barrel and would escalate at an annual rate of thereafter 
we also assumed that natural gas prices in and would be and per mcf  respectively  and would escalate at an annual rate of thereafter 
at december   we assumed that oil prices in would be per barrel and would escalate at an annual rate of thereafter 
we also assumed that natural gas prices in would be per mcf and would escalate at an annual rate of thereafter 
in estimates of declining production were based on internal estimates of which of the net present value was evaluated or audited by independent reserve engineers and estimated operating costs and severance taxes were based on past experience 
we also assumed at december  that operating and future development costs would remain constant thereafter 
at december  and  respectively  we assumed that operating and future development costs would escalate at an annual rate of in and  respectively 
reserve categories used in the impairment analysis for all periods considered are categories of proved reserves and probable and possible reserves  which were risk adjusted based on our drilling plans and history of successfully developing those types of reserves 
we periodically assess our unproved properties to determine if any such properties have been impaired 
such assessment is based on  among other things  the fair value of properties located in the same area as the unproved property and our intent to pursue additional exploration opportunities on such property 
stock compensation expense consists of noncash charges resulting from the application of the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
to certain stock options granted to employees and issuance of restricted stock to certain employees 
under interpretation no 
we are required to measure compensation cost on stock options that are considered to be variable awards until the date of exercise  forfeiture or expiration of such options 
compensation cost is measured for the amount of any increases in our stock price and recognized over the remaining vesting period of the options 
any decrease in our stock price will be recognized as a decrease in compensation cost limited to the amount of compensation cost previously recognized as a result of an increase in our stock price 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  office rent  legal fees  consultants  systems costs and other administrative costs incurred in our denver  dallas  houston and other offices 
while we expect such costs to increase with our growth  we expect such increases to be proportionately smaller than our production growth 
basis of presentation westport was formed by the merger on april  of westport oil and gas with epgc 
as a result of the merger  westport oil and gas became a wholly owned subsidiary of epgc  which subsequently changed its name to westport resources corporation  and the stockholders of westport oil and gas became the majority stockholders of epgc 
the senior management team of westport oil and gas became the management team for the combined company  complemented by certain key managers from epgc 
the merger between epgc and westport oil and gas was accounted for using purchase accounting with westport oil and gas as the surviving accounting entity 
westport began consolidating the results of epgc with the results of westport oil and gas as of the april  closing date 
on august   the stockholders of belco approved an agreement and plan of merger  dated as of june   between belco and westport 
pursuant to this agreement  westport was merged with and into belco  with belco surviving and changing its name to westport resources corporation 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase transaction for financial accounting purposes with westport as the surviving accounting entity 
westport began consolidating the results of belco with its results as of the august  closing date 
on september   we acquired oil and gas properties located in southeast texas for a total cash purchase price of approximately million 
we operate substantially all of the properties 
the purchase also includes  net undeveloped acres and an interest in square miles of d seismic data 
operations from the properties were included in for the period from october  to december  on december   we acquired producing properties  undeveloped leaseholds  gathering and compression facilities and other related assets in the greater natural buttes area of uintah county  utah from certain affiliates of el paso corporation for approximately million  subject to certain purchase price adjustments 
our newly formed western division is comprised substantially of these properties 
operations from the properties were included in our results for for the period from december  to december  results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data for the years ended december   and summary data for the years ended december  in thousands except per unit data production oil mbbls    natural gas mmcf    mmcfe    average daily production oil mbbls d natural gas mmcf d mmcfe d average prices oil per bbl natural gas per mcf hedging effect per mcfe

oil and natural gas revenues for increased by million  or  from million in to million in production from the acquired belco properties and other acquisitions  including the williston basin  southeast texas and utah acquisitions  accounted for million and million  respectively  of the increase 
revenue also increased million from recent discoveries in the gulf of mexico 
the increases in oil and natural gas revenues were partially offset by oil and natural gas production declines in the gulf of mexico developed properties and a decrease in realized average prices per mcfe  as discussed below 
production volumes increased bcfe from bcfe in to bcfe in acquired belco properties and other acquisitions  including the williston basin  southeast texas and utah acquisitions  accounted for bcfe and bcfe  respectively  of the increase 
production volumes also increased bcfe from recent discoveries in the gulf of mexico and bcfe from the horizontal drilling program in the wiley field 
the increases in production volumes were partially offset by oil and natural gas production declines in the gulf of mexico developed properties 
even though realized oil prices increased in compared to  realized natural gas prices decreased in compared to causing the realized average prices per mcfe to decrease 
hedging transactions had the effect of reducing oil and natural gas revenues by million in  or per mcfe  and increasing oil and natural gas revenues by million in  or per mcfe

production volumes also increased bcfe from recent discoveries in the gulf of mexico  bcfe from coalbed methane development in the powder river basin area  bcfe from the horizontal drilling program in the wiley field  and bcfe from the acquired interest in the ward estes field in august increases were partially offset by declines in existing properties 
hedging transactions had the effect of increasing oil and natural gas revenues by million in  or per mcfe  and reducing oil and natural gas revenues by million in  or per mcfe 
commodity price risk management activities  or cprm  activities 
the company recorded a net loss of million in the non hedge change in fair value of derivatives in compared to a net gain of million for the non hedge loss in fair value of derivatives in in the amount of million was related to derivative contracts entered into in anticipation of the expected production from the acquired properties 
upon closing of the acquisition  the derivative contracts qualified for hedge accounting treatment 
net gains of million and million were recorded in and  respectively  for non hedge settlements of derivatives 
the gains and losses relate to settlements of derivatives and changes in fair value of derivatives that under sfas no 
do not qualify for hedge accounting 
for  we recorded a net gain of million in the non hedge change in fair value of derivatives compared to a net loss of million for a net gain of million was recorded in for non hedge settlements of derivatives 
the gains and losses relate to settlements of derivatives and changes in fair value of derivatives that under sfas no 
do not qualify for hedge accounting 
gain loss on sale of operating assets 
for and  we recorded net losses of million and million  respectively  on sales of non core operating assets compared to a net gain of million in the gains and losses were calculated as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying value of the properties as of the date of the sale 
lease operating expense 
lease operating expense for increased by million  or  from million in to million in lease operating expenses from the acquired belco properties and other acquisitions  including the williston basin  southeast texas and utah acquisitions  accounted for and million  respectively  of the increase 
the remaining increase was primarily a result of increased production from recent offshore discoveries and nonrecurring workover expense in the gulf of mexico 
on a per mcfe basis  lease operating expense increased from in to in the increase on a per mcfe basis was primarily due to nonrecurring workover expense performed in at a rate of per mcfe 
lease operating expense for increased by million  or  from million in to million in lease operating expenses from the acquired epgc properties and belco properties accounted for million and million  respectively  of the increase 
recent discoveries in the gulf of mexico  an increased level of workovers in several of our properties and a general increase in the cost of oil field services and materials accounted for the remainder 
on a per mcfe basis  lease operating expense remained relatively constant at in and in production taxes 
production taxes for increased by million  or  from million in to million  in acquired belco properties and other acquisitions  including the williston basin  southeast texas and utah acquisitions  accounted for million and million  respectively  of the increase in production taxes 
the increase from the acquired belco properties and other acquisitions  including the williston basin  southeast texas and utah acquisitions  is partially offset by a decrease in revenue from onshore properties as a result of a decrease in realized average oil and natural gas prices 
as a percent of oil and natural gas revenues excluding the effects of hedges  production taxes increased from in to in the increase in production taxes as a percent of revenue is primarily the result of the acquired belco properties and other acquisitions  which increased the number of onshore properties that are subject to production taxes 
production taxes for increased by million  or  from million in to million  in acquired belco properties accounted for million of the increase in production taxes 
the increase from the acquired belco properties is partially offset by a decrease in revenue from onshore properties as a result of a decrease in realized oil and natural gas prices 
as a percent of oil and natural gas revenues excluding the effects of hedges  production taxes remained relatively constant at in and in transportation costs 
transportation costs for increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase from the acquired belco properties accounted for million of the increase 
the remaining increase was primarily due to a one time adjustment related to certain coalbed methane wells 
transportation costs for increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to additional offshore and coalbed methane wells that started producing in the latter part of and early  which incur higher costs to transport the natural gas 
exploration costs 
exploration costs for increased by million  or  from million in to million in exploration costs for increased by million  or  from million in to million in the following table sets forth the components of our  and exploration costs for the year ended december  in thousands geological and geophysical costs    unsuccessful property acquisitions delay rentals    exploratory dry holes    depletion  depreciation and amortization  or dd a  expense 
dd a expense increased million in  from million in to million in dd a expense related to the acquired belco properties and other acquisitions  including the williston basin  southeast texas and utah acquisitions  caused dd a expense to increase million and million  respectively 
recent discoveries in the gulf of mexico caused dd a expense to increase million 
the remaining increase was primarily due to the additions of oil and natural gas properties during on a per mcfe basis  dd a expense increased from to primarily due to recent discoveries in the gulf of mexico and acquired belco properties  which have a higher dd a expense per mcfe 
dd a expense increased million in  from million in to million in depletion related to the acquired epgc properties and belco properties caused dd a expense to increase million and million  respectively 
recent discoveries in the gulf of mexico caused dd a expense to increase million 
an increase of million was primarily due to additions in oil and natural gas properties in northern louisiana in the remaining increase was primarily due to the additions of oil and natural gas properties during these increases were the primary factors that caused dd a expense to increase on a per mcfe basis from in to in impairment of proved properties 
during  and  we recognized proved property impairments of million  million and million  respectively 
in  million of these impairments were attributable to unsuccessful development drilling in the rocky mountains and the remaining million was primarily the result of a decline in oil and natural gas reserve value due to reserve volume reductions in underperforming fields located onshore and offshore 
impairments recorded in were as follows million resulting from unsuccessful development drilling in the rocky mountains  million resulting from depressed oil and natural gas prices in the rocky mountains and mid continent  million resulting from unsuccessful development drilling in the gulf of mexico and million resulting from depressed natural gas prices in the gulf of mexico 
impairments recorded in were mainly the result of a decline in oil and natural gas reserve value due to reserve volume reductions in underperforming fields in wyoming  offshore and louisiana 
impairment of unproved properties 
in  we recognized unproved property impairments of million due to expired leases and from an assessment of the exploration opportunities existing on such properties 
the impairments were for million of leases held offshore  million for leases held in wyoming  million for leases held in texas and the remaining impairments were for various leases held in north dakota and louisiana 
in  we recognized unproved property impairments of million on offshore leases  as a result of an assessment of the exploration opportunities existing on such properties 
in  we recognized unproved property impairments of million  as a result of an assessment of the exploration opportunities existing on such properties 
the million consisted of million for leases held in north dakota  million for leases held offshore and million for various leases held in kansas  wyoming and louisiana

net loss for was million compared to net income of million for the variance was primarily attributable to increases in revenues of million and the change in the income taxes from a tax provision to a tax benefit of million offset by increases of million in operating expenses and million in other expense 
on a per share basis  the net loss was on both a basic and fully diluted basis compared to a per basic share and fully diluted for due to an increase of million shares outstanding and a net loss 
net income for was million compared to net income of million for the variance was primarily attributable to increases in revenues of million and decrease in other expense of million offset by increases of million in operating expenses and million in income tax expense 
on a per share basis net income declined to per basic share  fully diluted from per basic share  fully diluted due to an increase of million shares outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources our principal uses of capital have been for the exploitation  acquisition and exploration of oil and natural gas properties 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for net cash provided by operating activities in increased compared to due to a increase in oil and natural gas sales as a result of the mergers with belco and other acquisitions  including the williston basin  southeast texas and utah acquisitions  and recent discoveries in the gulf of mexico

financing activities for reflected borrowings of million utilized to consummate the merger with epgc and million from the issuance of common stock offset by repayments of long term debt of million 
financing activity the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt    non cancelable operating leases     total contractual cash obligations      revolving credit facility on december   we entered into the revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank and credit suisse first boston corporation to replace our previous revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility provides for a maximum committed amount of million and an initial borrowing base of approximately million 
the facility matures on december  and contains covenants and default provisions customary for similar credit facilities 
we made borrowings under the revolving credit facility to refinance our outstanding indebtedness under our previous revolving credit facility and to pay general corporate expenses 
advances under the revolving credit facility are in the form of either an abr loan or a eurodollar loan 
the interest on an abr loan is a fluctuating rate based upon the highest of the rate of interest announced by jp morgan chase bank  formerly known as the chase manhattan bank  as its prime rate  the secondary market rate for three month certificates of deposits plus  or the federal funds effective rate plus 
in each case plus a margin of to based upon the ratio of total debt to ebitdax and the ratings of our senior unsecured debt as issued by standard and poor s rating group and moody s investor services  inc the interest on a eurodollar loan is a fluctuating rate based upon the rate at which eurodollar deposits in the london interbank market are quoted plus a margin of to based upon the ratio of total debt to ebitdax and the ratings of our senior unsecured debt as issued by standard and poor s rating group and moody s investor service  inc as of december   we had borrowings of million with an average interest rate of and letters of credit issued of approximately million outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and available unused borrowing capacity of approximately million 
as of february   we had borrowings of million with an average interest rate of and letters of credit issued of approximately million outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and available unused borrowing capacity of approximately million 
the increase in letters of credit issued is due to the effect of increased commodity prices on the margin requirements of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts with our counterparties 
the revolving credit facility currently limits our outstanding letters of credit to million 
senior subordinated notes due in connection with the merger with belco  we assumed million face amount  million fair value  of belco s senior subordinated notes due on november   approximately million face amount of these notes was tendered to us pursuant to the change of control provisions of the related indenture 
the tender price was equal to of the principal amount of each note plus accrued and unpaid interest as of october  including the premium and accrued interest  the total amount paid was million 
we used borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund the repayment 
no gain or loss was recorded in connection with the redemption as the fair value of the senior subordinated notes recorded in connection with the merger with belco equaled the redemption cost 
senior subordinated notes due on december   we issued million in additional principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due  or the old notes  pursuant to rule a under the securities act at a price of of the principal amount  with accrued interest from november  the old notes are additional debt securities under the indenture pursuant to which  on november   we issued million of our senior subordinated notes due on march   all of the notes were exchanged in an exchange offer for an equal principal amount of the initial exchange notes 
we used the proceeds from the sale of the old notes to finance  in part  the acquisition 
on january   we filed the exchange offer registration statement pursuant to a registration rights agreement relating to the old notes 
in the event we fail to comply with some of our obligations under the registration rights agreement relating to the old notes  we will pay additional interest on the old notes 
the exchange offer registration statement was declared effective by the sec on january  we were offering to exchange up to million aggregate principal amount of new senior subordinated notes due  or exchange notes  that have been registered under the securities act for an equal principal amount of old notes 
the exchange offer expired at pm  new york city time  on march  we intend to close the exchange offer in march of this year 
the notes are senior subordinated unsecured obligations of westport and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by some of our existing and future restricted subsidiaries 
the notes mature on november  we pay interest on the notes semiannually on may and november our first interest payment on the old notes will be may  we are entitled to redeem the notes in whole or in part on or after november  for the redemption price set forth in the notes 
prior to november   we are entitled to redeem the notes  in whole but not in part  at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes plus a premium 
there is no sinking fund for the notes 
if we fail to comply with some of our obligations under the registration rights agreement relating to the old notes  we will pay additional interest on the old notes 
private equity offering on november   we completed the private equity offering of million shares of our common stock to spindrift partners  lp  spindrift investors bermuda lp  global natural resources iii and global natural resources iii lp at a net price to us of per share for aggregate proceeds of million 
the purchasers may be prohibited from selling this common stock at our option for up to days in the event we pursue a public equity offering during the next two years 
the terms of the sale were negotiated on november  and the net price represents a discount from the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange as of that date 
in connection with the private equity offering  we agreed to file a shelf registration statement registering the resale by the selling stockholders from time to time of the common stock we issued in the private equity offering 
we also agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective within days of the closing of the private equity offering 
in addition  we agreed  subject to certain rights of suspension  to keep such registration statement effective until the earlier of the date on which all of the shares have been a sold under the registration statement or b distributed pursuant to rule k under the securities act or two years after the date of the stock purchase agreement 
on december   we filed the shelf registration statement registering the resale by the selling stockholders from time to time of our common stock issued in the private equity offering  which registration statement was declared effective by the sec on january  shelf offering on december   we closed the shelf offering of million shares of common stock at a price of per share  which includes million shares covered by an over allotment option we granted to  and which was exercised by  the underwriters 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of our common stock  which we used to finance  in part  the acquisition 
capital expenditures we anticipate that our capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  for will be approximately million 
our capital expenditures for were million  excluding acquisitions of million and geological and geophysical costs of million 
we anticipate that our primary cash requirements for will include funding acquisitions  funding development projects and general working capital needs 
we will continue to seek opportunities for acquisitions of proved reserves with substantial exploitation and exploration potential 
the size and timing of capital requirements for acquisitions is inherently unpredictable and we therefore do not budget for them 
we expect to fund our capital expenditure activities  which include acquisition  development of and exploration on our oil and gas properties through cash flow from operations and available capacity under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that borrowings under the revolving credit facility  projected operating cash flows and cash on hand will be sufficient to meet the requirements of our business 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and oil and natural gas prices 
we cannot assure you that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures or that increased capital expenditures will not be undertaken 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to a variety of factors  including but not limited to drilling results  product prices  industry conditions and outlook  and future acquisition of properties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we periodically enter into commodity price risk management  or cprm  transactions to manage our exposure to oil and gas price volatility 
cprm transactions may take the form of futures contracts  swaps or options 
all cprm data is presented in accordance with requirements of sfas no 
 which the company adopted on january  accordingly  unrealized gains and losses related to the change in fair market value of derivative contracts that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as other comprehensive income or loss and such amounts are reclassified to oil and gas sales revenues as the associated production occurs 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in the consolidated statement of operations 
while such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  management believes these contracts can be utilized as an effective component of cprm activities 
for we recorded increases in operating revenues from non hedge cprm settlements in the amount of million  which includes million of cash settlements and non hedge change in fair value of derivatives of million  including million of ineffectiveness 
the majority or million of the non hedge loss in fair value of derivatives was related to derivative contracts entered into in anticipation of the expected production from the acquired properties 
upon closing of the acquisition  the derivative contracts qualified for hedge accounting treatment 
for  we recorded hedging settlement losses in the amount of million  which includes cash losses of million 
for  we recorded increases in operating revenues from non hedge cprm settlements in the amount of million  which includes million of cash settlements and non hedge change in fair value of derivatives of million 
for  we recorded a decrease in operating revenues from non hedge change in fair value of derivatives of million

for any particular nwprm swap sold transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to westport in the event that the nwprm index price for any settlement period is less than the swap price for such hedge  and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty in the event that the nwprm index price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price for such hedge 
for any particular cigrm swap sold transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to westport in the event that the cigrm index price for any settlement period is less than the swap price for such hedge  and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty in the event that the cigrm index price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price for such hedge 
for any particular nymex collar transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to westport if the average nymex reference price for the reference period is below the floor price for such transaction  and we are required to make payment to the counterparty if the average nymex reference price is above the ceiling price of such transaction

three way collars are settled as described in footnote above  with the following exception if the nymex reference price falls below the three way floor price  the average floor price is reduced by the amount the nymex reference price is below the three way floor price 
for example  if the nymex reference price is per bbl during the term of the three way collars  then the effective average floor price would be per bbl 
for any particular basis swap  the counterparty is required to make a payment to westport in the event that the difference between the nymex reference price and the applicable published index nwprm or cigrm for any settlement period is greater than the swap differential price for such hedge  and westport is required to make a payment to the counterparty in the event that the difference between the nymex reference price and the applicable published index nmprm or cigrm for any settlement period is less than the swap differential price for such hedge 
interest rate swap agreements the following table summarizes the interest rate swap contracts we currently have in place current notional amount transaction date expiration date estimated rate million november november  libor million january november  libor million january november  libor million february november  libor we entered into the interest rate swap contracts above to hedge the fair value of a portion of the senior subordinated notes 
because these swaps meet the conditions to qualify for the short cut method of assessing effectiveness under the provisions of sfas  the change in the fair value of the debt is assumed to equal the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap 
as such  there is no ineffectiveness assumed to exist between the interest rate swap and the notes 
as of december   we recorded a derivative asset of million related to the interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedges  with a corresponding debt increase 
in september  we terminated an interest rate swap on the senior subordinated notes resulting in the receipt of a million fair value gain  which was added to the outstanding debt balance and will be amortized over the remaining life of the note 
for  we recorded other income of million related to the change in fair value of the non hedge interest rate swap
