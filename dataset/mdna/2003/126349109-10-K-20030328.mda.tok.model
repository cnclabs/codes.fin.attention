comcast and at t broadband business relationship background 
in september  the company entered into a year exclusive contract the master subscriber agreement with tele communications  inc tci to consolidate all tci customers onto the company s customer care and billing system 
in and  respectively  at t completed its mergers with tci and mediaone group  inc mediaone  and consolidated the merged operations into at t broadband at t  and the company continued to service the merged operations under the terms of the master subscriber agreement 
on november   comcast corporation comcast completed its merger with at t  and now under comcast s ownership  the company continues to service the former at t operations under the terms of the master subscriber agreement 
the key terms of the master subscriber agreement are discussed below 
significance of the master subscriber agreement 
the company generates a significant percentage of its total revenues under the master subscriber agreement 
during the years ended december    and  revenues generated under the master subscriber agreement represented approximately   and of total revenues 
the substantial decrease in the percentage between and relates primarily to a decrease in the amount of software and professional services purchased under the master subscriber agreement in when compared to  as well as an increase in the company s total revenues between periods from all other clients  including revenue related to the acquisition of the kenan business 
the company expects that the percentage of its total revenues in generated under the master subscriber agreement will represent a percentage comparable to that of there are inherent risks whenever this large of a percentage of total revenues is concentrated with one client 
one such risk is that  should comcast s business generally decline  it would have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
legal proceedings 
during  the company was involved in various legal proceedings with at t and comcast both before and after comcast s november  merger with at t related to the master subscriber agreement  summarized as follows at t legal proceedings on march   at t notified the company that at t was considering initiating arbitration proceedings relating to the master subscriber agreement 
at t stated that any action to terminate the master subscriber agreement would be based upon the following claims 
first  at t claimed that the company failed to provide bundled or aggregated billing services  including the company s breach of its obligation to provide telephony billing when required to do so under the master subscriber agreement 
second  the letter stated that the company has not cooperated with at t in utilizing another vendor to provide aggregated billing services  as well as the company s improper assertion of its exclusivity rights 
third  the letter claimed that the company has breached the most favored nations clause of the master subscriber agreement 
at t further stated that should a negotiated resolution not be achieved  at t could elect to seek a declaration that it is entitled to terminate the master subscriber agreement on the fifth anniversary of the contract which was august  on march   at t filed for injunctive relief in the arapahoe county district court in colorado to obtain certain data files from the company 
on april   the court dismissed at t s claim  ruling that if at t sought to pursue the matter  it must do so in arbitration pursuant to the dispute resolution clause of the master subscriber agreement 
on may   at t filed a demand with the american arbitration association aaa to arbitrate its claims against the company 
in its demand for arbitration  at t cited matters consistent with those of the march  allegations against the company  and the march  injunctive relief action  as discussed immediately above 
the claims are as follows first  at t claimed that the company has interfered with at t s right to provide aggregated billing services to its customers 
in particular  at t contended that the company had not cooperated with at t in utilizing another vendor to provide aggregated billing services and that the company had improperly asserted its exclusivity rights under the master subscriber agreement 
second  at t claimed that the company had breached the most favored nations clause of the master subscriber agreement 
and finally  at t claimed that the company had violated its obligation to provide at t with its customer data in a deconversion format 
in the arbitration  at t seeks a declaration that it was entitled to terminate the master subscriber agreement on its fifth anniversary august   or at any time thereafter  on days written notice to the company 
if  as a result of the outcome of the arbitration proceedings  it is ruled that at t has the right to and ultimately elects to terminate the contract or otherwise converts some or all of its customers to another service provider  at t seeks full cooperation from the company for whatever period of time it takes to convert its approximately million customers to another vendor s customer care and billing system 
in addition  at t seeks unspecified damages from the company 
on may   the company responded to at t s arbitration demand 
in its response  the company denied at t s allegations that the company had breached the master subscriber agreement 
the company also filed a number of counter claims alleging that at t had breached its obligations to the company and is seeking unspecified damages 
included among the company s counterclaims against at t is a request for a declaratory judgement that following the at t and comcast merger which occurred on november   the approximately million comcast customers would be subject to the master subscriber agreement and thereby must  subject to certain conditions  be processed on the company s system 
see the discussion below for the status of the arbitration proceedings 
comcast legal proceedings the first three matters listed below precede the closing of the comcast and at t merger on november  on june   the company filed a complaint in us district court in denver  colorado alleging  among other things  that comcast had unlawfully interfered with the master subscriber agreement as of that date  and sought a declaratory judgement that the approximately million comcast customers would be subject to the master subscriber agreement and thereby must  subject to certain conditions  be processed on the company s system 
in its complaint  the company sought unspecified damages for comcast s illegal conduct and interference with the master subscriber agreement 
on november   the company voluntarily withdrew the june  complaint against comcast without prejudice 
the company has the right to resubmit this complaint against comcast 
on november   comcast  and its wholly owned subsidiaries  comcast holdings corporation comcast holdings and comcast cable communications  inc comcast cable  filed a complaint in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
the complaint was filed in connection with a complex series of corporate transactions undertaken in connection with the merger between comcast and at t 
the complaint seeks a declaration that comcast  comcast holdings and comcast cable subsidiaries under the parent company comcast are not bound by the existing master subscriber agreement  either as a result of comcast s pre existing subsidiaries not being bound by the master subscriber agreement  or alternatively  comcast s customers serviced by those subsidiaries not being bound by the master subscriber agreement  prior to july  due to pre existing contractual obligations with other billing vendors 
further  the complaint alleges that comcast has the right to terminate the master subscriber agreement by transferring all at t customers the company services under the master subscriber agreement to a different contract between the company and comcast cable 
finally  comcast sought to have all of these issues decided by the us district court  not in the pending arbitration initiated by at t against the company 
on december   the company filed a motion in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania requesting the court to dismiss the complaint filed by comcast on november   or alternatively  stay any action on the complaint until the arbitration proceedings between the two parties regarding the master subscriber agreement are completed 
in addition  in its motion  the company argues that the complaints detailed in comcast s lawsuit should be added as part of the master subscriber agreement arbitration proceedings 
on february   the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania issued an order to stay the november  complaint filed by comcast 
the order requires the company and comcast to submit to the court a status report periodically on the arbitration proceedings between the two parties 
current status of the legal proceedings 
the company believes that effective with the closing of the comcast and at t merger  comcast has effectively assumed all of the rights and obligations under the master subscriber agreement  and is the party responsible for the master subscriber agreement 
unless specifically identified differently  references to comcast hereafter in this document include at t and its predecessor companies referenced above 
both parties have agreed upon a single arbitrator to hear the dispute  and the arbitration is currently scheduled to begin on may  the hearing date is subject to change based upon a variety of factors and is expected to take several weeks to complete 
the company emphatically denies the allegations made by comcast in the arbitration demand  and denies that it is in breach of the master subscriber agreement 
however  if the arbitrator determines that the company either has i materially or repeatedly defaulted in the performance of its obligations without satisfying the cure provisions of the master subscriber agreement  or ii failed to substantially comply with its material obligations under the master subscriber agreement taken as a whole  then comcast may be able to terminate the master subscriber agreement prior to its natural expiration on december  should comcast be successful in i its claims for unspecified damages or its most favored nations claims  or ii terminating the master subscriber agreement in whole or in part  the resulting impact could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if comcast is successful in any of its claims under either of its complaints discussed above  in whole or in part  it could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   the company has not reflected an accrual on its consolidated balance sheet for the potential exposure for any loss related to the comcast legal proceedings discussed above  primarily from the arbitration proceedings  because the company has concluded that it is not probable that such a loss has occurred  and the amount of any potential loss could not reasonably be estimated at this time  even within a range 
in addition  the company has various long lived intangible assets client contracts related to the master subscriber agreement which have a net carrying value as of december  of approximately million 
because of the uncertainty regarding the outcome of these matters  the company does not believe there has been any impairment to the carrying value of these intangible assets as of the date of this filing 
however  should comcast be successful in i terminating the master subscriber agreement in whole or in part  ii significantly modifying the terms of the master subscriber agreement  or iii significantly reducing the revenues expected to be generated under the master subscriber agreement  it is reasonably possible that an impairment of these intangible assets could result  and the amount of the impairment could be substantial 
while the substance of any negotiations between the company and comcast  as well as any arbitration proceedings  are not being made public at this time  readers are strongly encouraged to review frequently the company s filings with the sec as well as all public announcements from the company relating to the dispute between the companies 
this is of particular importance as it is impossible to predict accurately at this time when any partial or entire resolution to this dispute may be forthcoming  either inside or outside of the arbitration process 
contract rights and obligations as amended 
the master subscriber agreement has an original term of years and expires in the master subscriber agreement has minimum financial commitments based upon processing million wireline video customers and one million internet high speed data customers over the term of the contract  and in the company s view  includes exclusive rights to provide customer care and billing products and services for comcast s offerings of wireline video  internet high speed data services  and print and mail services 
the minimum financial commitments due from comcast under the master subscriber agreement for are approximately million  and increase by an inflation factor each year through the end of the contract expiration date of during the fourth quarter of  the company relinquished its exclusive rights to process comcast s wireline telephony customers  and those comcast customers were fully converted to another service provider by the end of the loss of these customers did not have a material impact on the company s result of operations 
effective april  the company amended its agreement with comcast giving the company certain additional contractual rights to continue processing  for a minimum of one year  customers that comcast may divest 
these new rights are co terminus with and are in addition to the existing minimum processing commitments the company has with comcast through any such divestitures to a third party would not i relieve comcast of its minimum processing commitments  ii impact the company s exclusivity rights under the master subscriber agreement  or iii impact the term of the master subscriber agreement 
the master subscriber agreement contains certain performance criteria and other obligations to be met by the company 
to fulfill the master subscriber agreement and to remain competitive  the company believes it will be required to develop additional features to existing products and services  and possibly in certain circumstances  new products and services  all of which will require substantial research and development  as well as implementation and operational aptitude 
the company is required to perform certain remedial efforts and is subject to certain penalties if it fails to meet the performance criteria or other obligations 
the company is also subject to an annual technical audit to determine whether the company s products and services include innovations in features and functions that have become standard in the wireline video industry 
if the audit determines the company is not providing such an innovation and it fails to do so in the manner and time period dictated by the contract  then comcast would be released from its exclusivity obligation to the extent necessary to obtain the innovation from a third party 
as a result of two separate technical audits  the company believes that it is in compliance with the master subscriber agreement s technical audit requirements 
comcast has recently requested that the companies forego the third technical audit in light of the pending arbitration 
in light of comcast s request and the arbitration proceedings  the company is not pursuing a technical audit at this time 
comcast has the right to terminate the master subscriber agreement in the event of certain defaults by the company 
to date  the company believes it has complied with the terms of the contract  and expects to continue to perform successfully under the master subscriber agreement 
should the company fail to meet its obligations under the master subscriber agreement  or should comcast be successful in any action to either terminate the master subscriber agreement in whole or in part  or collect damages caused by an alleged breach  it would have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
likewise  if comcast were to breach its material obligations to the company  that would have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
indeed  on september   comcast then at t broadband filed a demand for arbitration relating to the master subscriber agreement  causing a significant drop in the trading price of the company s common stock 
on october   comcast then at t broadband and the company entered into a settlement and release agreement whereby all claims  except for certain claims relating to the scope of the company s exclusive rights under the master subscriber agreement  that were or could have been raised were mutually released by the parties 
in connection with the dismissal  the companies agreed to amend the master subscriber agreement 
see the company s form k for additional discussions of this matter 
historically  a substantial percentage of the company s revenue growth has resulted from the sale of products and services under the master subscriber agreement  both of which are in excess of the minimum financial commitments included in the contract 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to sell products and services to comcast in excess of the minimum financial commitments included in the contract 
a copy of the master subscriber agreement and all subsequent amendments are included in the company s exhibits to its periodic public filings with the sec 
these documents are available on the internet and the company encourages readers to review these documents for further details 
business acquisitions kenan business acquisition background 
on february   the company closed on its agreement to acquire the billing and customer care assets of lucent technologies inc lucent for million in cash 
lucent s billing and customer care business consists primarily of i software products and related consulting services acquired by lucent when it purchased kenan systems corporation in february  ii billdats data manager mediation software  and iii elements of lucent s client support  product support  and sales and marketing organizations collectively  the kenan business 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the kenan business and further details of the acquisition 
in conjunction with the kenan business acquisition  the company incurred certain direct and incremental acquisition related expenses 
the company does not expect to incur any additional acquisition related expenses subsequent to december   as it has completed its integration of the kenan business 
the acquisition related expenses for the year ended december  are presented below in thousands 
in process research and development impairment of an existing intangible asset employee related costs primarily existing csg employee redundancy costs and retention bonuses for key kenan business employees integration costs eg  foreign entity structuring  process integration  etc 
all other total kenan business acquisition related expenses in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of the kenan business  the company allocated million of the million purchase price to in process research and development iprd 
as part of the process of analyzing this acquisition  the decision was made to acquire technology  including technology in the process of being designed and qualified  rather than to develop the technology internally 
this decision was based on factors such as the amount of internal expertise  time and cost it would take to bring the technology to market 
the kenan business is a product centric billing business with a core product strategy of developing billing and customer care solutions that enable service providers to capture revenue streams through the introduction of applications and services 
the kenan business primary product offerings include i csg kenan bp formerly known as arbor bp  a core convergent billing platform  ii csg kenan om formerly known as arbor om order management  an order management platform  and iii csg data mediation formerly known as billdats data manager  a billing mediation software product 
at the acquisition date  the kenan business was undergoing development efforts related to six projects a significant new release of csg kenan bp  the next major release of csg kenan om  two new versions of csg data mediation  and new offerings related to prepay billing and contents settlements 
these development efforts were all proprietary  internal projects 
at the acquisition date  the iprd projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and had no alternative future uses 
the majority of the value assigned to iprd related to csg kenan bp million  a new prepay billing offering million and two new versions of csg data mediation million 
the kenan business ongoing iprd projects were identified through detailed analyses of research and development plans concerning i the uniqueness of the developmental work  ii the critical tasks required to complete the projects  iii the opportunities which are expected to arise from the projects  iv the degree of leverage of the new technology on legacy technology  v the risks to project completion  vi an assessment of the types of efforts involved  vii the length of time the projects are expected to be useful  and viii the timing of project completion  resources allocated to completion and expected expenses 
the company s assessment was based on extensive interviews and a detailed analysis of research and development plans 
if a project required additional planning  designing  coding or testing activities to determine whether the associated product could be produced to meet its design specifications  the company determined that technological feasibility had not been reached with respect to that project 
due to the complexity and specialized features of the acquired research and development  the technologies under development could only be economically used for their intended purposes 
if the company failed in its efforts  no alternative economic value would result from these efforts 
accordingly  the value allocated to projects  which had not reached technology feasibility  was immediately expensed at the date of acquisition 
the company estimated the fair value of iprd using an income approach 
this entailed discounting expected cash flows to the present at a rate of return that incorporates the risk free rate of the use of the funds  the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with the particular investment 
the selected rates consider the level of completion for each project achieved at the date of acquisition 
estimated future net cash flows attributable to the kenan business iprd projects  assuming successful development  were discounted to net present value using discount rates of for the csg kenan bp  csg kenan om  and csg data mediation version projects and for the csg data mediation version  prepay billing and content settlements projects 
the company was expecting material net cash flows to commence for all six in process purchased r d projects in the company believed that the estimated iprd amount so determined represented fair value and did not exceed the amount another third party would pay for the projects 
revenue estimates used in these estimates were based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
this analysis included the revenues projected to result from the expected evolution of the technology over time 
operating expenses used in the estimates included selling  general and administrative and research and development 
these expense estimates were based on an overall analysis of the business enterprise 
total research and development expenses were divided into two categories i the costs to complete the iprd projects  and ii costs to maintain developed products that had already been introduced to the market 
the total research and development expenses  as derived from the overall analysis of the business enterprise  were allocated based upon management estimates 
costs to complete in process projects were estimated by company management  with approximately million projected to be spent on the projects in the year following the acquisition of the kenan business 
these costs were allocated based on an analysis of completion efforts and expected completion dates 
the resultant target margins that the kenan business expected to achieve from the in process products ranged from approximately to 
profitability was expected to be significantly lower in the first years of the product s lifecycle compared to the later years due to the earlier years higher levels of research and development and sales and marketing 
the financial forecasts only included results that were expected to be generated by the kenan business on a standalone basis 
synergies resulting from the acquisition by the company were not incorporated into the analysis 
development of the majority of the iprd projects began in the fourth quarter of calendar and were expected to be released at or near the end of at the acquisition date  approximately engineers were engaged in the development of the kenan business iprd projects 
completion of these projects was expected to require significant efforts involving continued software development as well as the testing and re qualification efforts required to turn the technologies into a set of bug free  commercial ready products 
these remaining tasks involved substantial risk due to the complex nature of the activities involved 
as of december   the company has made substantial progress related to the development and commercialization of the acquired technologies 
as of the date of this filing  the two new releases of csg kenan bp  the two versions of csg data mediation  and the new offerings related to prepay billing and contents settlements have been completed and are generally available to the company s clients 
subsequent to the original iprd analysis  the csg kenan om project was broken down into several modules that are expected to be introduced into the marketplace separately 
this change does not impact the valuation of the iprd 
the csg kenan om modules are expected to be completed in the third quarter of the expenses incurred to date to complete the iprd projects are consistent with the company s previous estimates 
the company believes that the foregoing assumptions used in the iprd analysis were reasonable at the time 
as discussed in the restructuring charges section below  the company believes the economic slowdown in the global telecommunications industry may potentially limit the amount of products and services current or future clients may purchase from the company 
as of december   the company has reevaluated its assumptions used in the iprd analysis and believes the underlying assumptions still support the valuation of the iprd at this time 
however  there can be no assurance that the underlying assumptions used in the iprd analysis will transpire as estimated 
impairment of existing csg intangible asset 
the impairment of an existing intangible asset relates to a data mediation software asset  which was acquired by the company in as part of the kenan business acquisition  the company acquired data mediation software assets with superior technology  resulting in the impairment of this existing software asset 
assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
key drivers of the value of the acquired kenan business are the global telecommunications industry customer base and the software assets acquired 
in connection with this acquisition  the company recorded approximately million of goodwill  and as of december   had other long lived intangible assets client contracts and software with a net carrying value of approximately million 
in addition to the requirement to perform an annual goodwill impairment test  goodwill and other long lived intangible assets are required to be evaluated for possible impairment on a periodic basis eg  quarterly if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a possible impairment of these assets may have occurred 
the company has evaluated the carrying value of the kenan business goodwill and related long lived intangible assets in light of the depressed economic state of the global telecommunications industry  and believes the carrying value of these assets have not been impaired as of the date of this filing 
the company will continually monitor the carrying value of these assets during this economic downturn in this industry sector 
if the current economic conditions worsen and or take longer to recover than anticipated  it is reasonably possible that a review for impairment of the kenan business goodwill and or related long lived intangible assets in the future may indicate that these assets are impaired  and the amount of impairment could be substantial 
davinci technologies on december   the company acquired of the common stock of davinci technologies inc davinci  a toronto  canada based company  for million in cash net of million in acquired cash  plus million in acquisition costs 
the acquisition of davinci gave the company ownership of davinci s m care solution which will be integrated with the company s csg kenan bp product to enhance its customer self care and electronic bill presentment and payment features

see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the planet acquisition 
restructuring charges the economic state of the global telecommunications industry eg  cable television  satellite  wireline and wireless telephony  internet and high speed data  etc 
continues to be depressed  with many of the companies operating within this industry publicly reporting decreased revenues and earnings  as well as several companies recently filing for bankruptcy protection 
public reports indicate any expected turnaround in the economic state of the global telecommunications industry could be slow  and a sustained recovery could take several years 
many telecommunications companies have announced cost and capital expenditure reduction programs to cope with the depressed economic state of the industry  and the company has experienced this in certain of its sales discussions with current and prospective clients 
since most of the company s current and future clients operate within this industry sector  the economic state of this industry directly impacts the company s business  potentially limiting the amount of products and services current or future clients may purchase from the company 
due to the economic decline in the global telecommunications industry  and the uncertainty in the timing and the extent of any economic turnaround within the industry  the company implemented several cost reduction initiatives during the third quarter of these initiatives included i involuntary employee terminations from all areas of the company of approximately people approximately of the company s workforce  ii limited hiring of new employees  iii a reduction of the company s facilities and infrastructure support costs  including facilities consolidations and abandonments  and iv reductions in costs in several discretionary spending areas  such as travel and entertainment 
substantially all of the involuntary employee terminations were completed during the third quarter of  with the remainder completed during the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter financial results substantially reflect the full implementation of the cost savings initiatives  which are expected to result in approximately million of annual cost savings  when compared to the company s operating results for the second quarter of the company believes that the operational impact from these initiatives will not negatively impact its ability to service its current or future clients  and will not limit its ability to grow its business in the future when the economic conditions within the global telecommunications industry improve 
in connection with the cost reduction initiatives discussed above  the company recorded the following restructuring charges for the year ended december  in thousands 
involuntary employee termination benefits facilities abandonment all other total restructuring charges the involuntary employee termination benefits component of the business restructuring charges relates primarily to severance payments and job placement assistance  with substantially all of these amounts paid out as of december  the facilities abandonment component of the business restructuring charges relates to office facilities the company has committed to abandon that are under long term lease agreements 
the facilities abandonment charge is equal to the present value of the future costs associated with those abandoned facilities  net of the estimated proceeds from any future sublease agreements 
the company has used estimates to arrive at both the future costs of the abandoned facilities and the proceeds from any future sublease agreements 
the company will continue to evaluate its estimates in recording the facilities abandonment charge 
as a result  there may be additional charges or reversals in the future 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the company s restructuring charges 
adjusted results of operations operating income presented under accounting principles generally accepted in the us reported earnings for the year ended december  was million  compared to for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
net income on a reported earnings basis for the year ended december  was million per diluted share  compared to million per diluted share for the year ended december   a decrease of million per diluted share 
approximately million of the decrease in operating income between periods  and million per diluted share of the decrease in net income between periods is attributed to certain direct and incremental acquisition related expenses incurred as a result of the kenan business acquisition  and the restructuring charges recorded in the second half of  as discussed above 
the remainder of the decrease in both measures relates primarily to lower software and professional services revenues in the company s broadband division in  when compared to to provide for an additional comparison of the company s current results of operations with past and future periods  the company has adjusted out from reported earnings the impact of the kenan business acquisition related expenses and the restructuring charges adjusted earnings 
the company believes that these costs are infrequent in their occurrence and somewhat unique in their nature such that excluding them in certain analyses provides additional information of value to those interested in the evaluation of the company s operations  especially when attempting to make comparisons between multiple periods in which these types of items did not occur  or differ significantly between periods 
although these types of costs are considered infrequent in their occurrence  it is reasonably likely they could occur again in the near future 
management reviews both reported earnings and adjusted earnings financial measures in evaluating the company s performance 
as stated above  operating income and net income on an adjusted basis have been computed by excluding these charges 
the impact of these charges on the company s pretax income was considered in determining the adjusted earnings effective income tax rate of 
the difference between the adjusted earnings effective tax rate and the company s reported earnings effective income tax rate of relates primarily to the tax attributes of certain kenan business acquisition related expenses recorded in the first quarter of a reconciliation of the company s reported earnings and adjusted earnings is as follows in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  reported earnings impact of acquisition related expenses impact of restructuring charges adjusted earnings total revenues total operating expenses operating income net interest and other income before income taxes income tax provision net income weighted average shares net income per diluted share adelphia communications corporation the company provides processing services for approximately three million of adelphia communications corporation s adelphia video customers 
adelphia filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter on june  the company deferred the recognition of adelphia s june processing revenues due to the collectibility risk resulting from the bankruptcy filing and increased its allowance for doubtful accounts in the second quarter of for outstanding accounts receivable from adelphia dated prior to june the company believes it is adequately reserved against its collectibility exposure for pre bankruptcy accounts receivable of adelphia as of december  the company continues to provide processing services for adelphia post bankruptcy 
as of the date of this filing  adelphia is current on substantially all invoices related to services provided post bankruptcy  and the company believes that all amounts invoiced for future services will be fully collected under the current contractual payment terms 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the company to select appropriate accounting policies  and to make judgements and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying the company s accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified the most critical accounting principles upon which the company s financial status depends 
the critical accounting principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting principles identified relate to i revenue recognition  ii allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  iii business restructuring  iv capitalization of internal software development costs  v intangible assets  vi business combinations  and vii income taxes 
these critical accounting policies and the company s other significant accounting policies are disclosed in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company derives its revenues from the following sources i processing and related services  ii software licenses  iii maintenance services  and iv professional services 
the company has historically generated a substantial percentage of its total revenues from providing processing and related services 
as a result of the kenan business acquisition  the company expects revenue from software licenses  maintenance services  and professional services to increase and become a larger percentage of total revenues 
collectibility of fees is one of the key revenue recognition criteria for the company for all revenue sources 
revenues are recognized only if the company determines that the collection of the fees included in the arrangement is considered probable ie  the company expects the client to pay all amounts in full when invoiced 
in making its determination of collectibility for revenue recognition purposes  the company considers a number of factors depending upon the specific aspects of an arrangement  which may include  but is not limited to  the following items i an assessment of the client s specific credit worthiness  evidenced by its current financial condition and or recent operating results  credit ratings  and or a bankruptcy filing status as applicable  ii the client s current accounts receivable status and or its historical payment patterns with the company as applicable  iii the economic condition of the industry in which the client conducts the majority of its business  and or iv the economic conditions and or political stability of the country or region in which the client is domiciled and or conducts the majority of its business 
the determination of collectibility requires significant judgements to be made by the company 
the risk of an incorrect collectibility assessment by the company is heightened due to the current depressed state of the global telecommunications industry  as discussed above 
the judgements made in this area could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
the accounting for processing and related services revenues generally requires few judgements and estimates as these revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
processing fees are typically billed monthly based on the number of client s customers served  ancillary services are typically billed on a per transaction basis  and certain customized print and mail services are billed on a usage basis 
the accounting for software revenues  especially when software is sold in a multiple element arrangement  is complex and requires judgement in applying the applicable accounting literature  primarily i american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended sop  ii sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  iii sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  and iv the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware eitf 
the primary revenue recognition criteria include i evidence of an arrangement  ii delivery  iii fixed or determinable fees  and iv collectibility of fees which is discussed above 
key judgmental matters considered in accounting for software and related services include i the identification of the separate elements of the arrangement  ii whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  iii the assessment of whether the company s hosted service transactions meet the requirements of eitf to be treated as a separate element to the software arrangement  iv the determination of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various elements of the software arrangement  v the assessment of whether the software fees are fixed or determinable  vi the determination as to whether the fees are considered collectible as discussed above  and vii the assessment of whether services included in the software arrangement represent significant production  customization or modification of the software 
the judgements made in this area could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
in addition  because software licenses typically have little or no direct  incremental costs related to the recognition of the revenue  these judgements could also have a significant effect on net income or loss 
the gss division s software arrangements may include projects for implementation services that involve significant production  customization or modification of the software being licensed 
accordingly  revenues related to these software arrangements are recognized over the course of these arrangements using the percentage of completion poc method of accounting in conformity with i sop  ii accounting research bulletin no 
 long term construction type contracts arb  and iii sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
under the poc method of accounting  software license and professional services revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
provisions for any estimated losses on uncompleted projects are made in the period in which such losses become evident 
the company typically uses hours performed on the project as the basis to determine the percentage of the work completed 
the company s use of the poc method of accounting on a project requires estimates of the total project revenues  total project costs  and the total expected hours necessary to complete a project 
the company believes it has adequate processes to produce reasonably dependable estimates for these items in order to justify the use of the poc method of accounting 
however  changes in estimates as a result of additional information or experience on a project as work progresses are inherent characteristics of the poc method of accounting as the company is exposed to various business risks in completing its projects 
the estimation process to support the poc method of accounting is more difficult for projects of greater length and or complexity 
factors that increase the complexity of an implementation project are discussed in more detail in exhibit under implementation project complexities and risks included in this report 
the estimates and judgements made in this area could i have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized  and or ii impact the expected profitability of a project  including whether an overall loss on an arrangement has occurred 
for the year ended december   approximately of the gss division s total recognized revenues were accounted for using the poc method of accounting 
the accounting for software maintenance services generally requires few judgements and estimates as these revenues are recognized ratably over the service period 
however  certain estimations may be required when maintenance services are sold as part of a multiple element arrangement  as a portion of the overall fee arrangement must be allocated to the undelivered maintenance services 
the key judgmental matters considered in accounting for maintenance services in a multiple element arrangement include i the determination of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the maintenance services  and ii the period of time maintenance services are expected to be performed 
the judgements made in this area could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any one period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
professional services revenues consist of a variety of consulting services  such as product implementation and customization  business consulting  project management  and training services 
revenue from professional services billed on a time and materials basis is recognized as the services are performed and when amounts due from customers are deemed collectible and contractually non refundable 
there are few judgements and estimates made in accounting for these types of arrangements 
revenue from fixed price long term contracts is recognized using the poc method of accounting  using hours completed as the basis for determining the percentage of the work completed 
the use of estimates and the risks related to the poc method of accounting for these types of arrangements are similar to those discussed above 
as stated above  the estimates and judgements made in this area could i have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized  and or ii impact the expected profitability of a project  including whether an overall loss on an arrangement has occurred 
in instances when the work performed on fixed price agreements is of relatively short duration  or if the company is unable to make reasonably dependable estimates at the outset of the arrangement  the company uses the completed contract method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized when the work is completed 
there are few judgements and estimates made in accounting for these types of arrangements 
in october  the eitf published its consensus decision on eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf provides guidance as to what constitutes separate units of accounting in multiple element revenue contracts 
eitf only addresses the determination of the separate units of accounting  not the specific revenue accounting for each of the units once they are identified 
the guidelines of eitf are effective for revenue transactions entered into after june  eitf does not apply to the company s software and services transactions that follow the guidelines of sop  sop and eitf  as discussed above 
the company is currently analyzing the impact  if any  of adopting eitf the financial accounting standards board is expected to begin work on a revenue recognition project in the near future  and from time to time  the various authoritative accounting rule makers and interpretative bodies  including the securities and exchange commission sec  provide interpretations of existing accounting principles which address revenue recognition 
the conclusions and interpretations reached in these matters may impact the company s significant revenue recognition accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on client specific allowances  as well as a general allowance 
specific allowances are maintained for clients which are determined to have a high degree of collectibility risk based on such factors  among others  as i the aging of the accounts receivable balance  ii the client s past payment experience  iii the economic condition of the industry in which the client conducts the majority of its business  iv the economic conditions and or political stability of the country or region in which the client is domiciled and or conducts the majority of its business  and v a deterioration in a client s financial condition  evidenced by  weak financial condition and or continued poor operating results  reduced credit ratings  and or a bankruptcy filing 
in addition to the specific allowance  the company maintains a general allowance for all its accounts receivable which are not covered by a specific allowance 
the general allowance is established based on such factors  among others  as i the total balance of the outstanding accounts receivable  including considerations of the aging categories of those accounts receivable  ii past history of uncollectible accounts receivable write offs  and iii the overall creditworthiness of the client base  including considerations of the economic condition of the global telecommunications industry 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realizability of accounts receivable 
should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of the overall allowance change adversely  an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts receivable may be necessary 
because of the significance of the company s account receivable balance as of december   such an adjustment could be material 
historically  credit losses have been predictable because of the concentration of revenues with a small number of large  established companies 
the kenan business acquisition has changed the principal concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable  as the company has moved from having its primary clients being large  established cable television and satellite companies located in the us  to being a wide range of telecommunications service providers located throughout the world 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the detail of the company s billed accounts receivable by geographic region 
in addition  as discussed above  the economic state of the global telecommunications industry continues to be depressed which has had an adverse impact on the normal cash collection cycles 
since most of the company s current and future clients operate within this industry sector  the economic state of this industry directly impacts the company s business  increasing the likelihood of uncollectible amounts from current and future accounts receivable and lengthening the cash collection cycle 
as discussed above  the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for its estimated credit losses on accounts receivable 
the expansion of the company s international business as a result of the kenan business acquisition  combined with the downturn in the global telecommunications industry  has increased the complexity in estimating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
business restructuring 
the company recorded restructuring charges during related primarily to involuntary employee termination benefits and facilities abandonments 
the company s accounting for involuntary employee termination benefits generally does not require significant judgements as the company identifies the specific individuals and their termination benefits in the early stage of the restructuring program  and the timing of the benefit payments is relatively short 
some judgment is needed in determining whether any legal exposure exists from the involuntary employee terminations  especially in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the accounting for facilities abandonments requires significant judgements in determining the restructuring charges  primarily related to the assumptions regarding the timing and the amount of any sublease arrangements for the abandoned facilities  and the discount rates used to determine the present value of the liabilities 
the company continually evaluates these assumptions  and adjusts the related restructuring reserve based on the revised assumptions at that time 
depending upon the significance in the change of assumptions  the additional restructuring charges could be material 
capitalization of internal software development costs 
the company expends substantial amounts on research and development r d  particularly for new products or services  or for enhancements of existing products and services 
for internal development of software products that are to be licensed by the company  the company follows statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas 
sfas requires that the cost of developing software be expensed prior to establishing technological feasibility  and those costs be capitalized once technological feasibility has been established 
capitalization ceases upon general release of the software 
for development of software to be used internally eg  processing systems software  the company follows sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop requires that the cost of developing software for internal use be expensed prior to the application development stage 
the determination of whether internal software r d costs are subject to capitalization in either case is  by its nature  highly subjective and involves significant judgements 
this decision could significantly affect earnings during the development period by either i capitalizing development costs  or ii expensing pre technological feasibility and pre application development stage research costs 
further  once capitalized  the software costs are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the product 
the determination of the expected useful life of a product is highly judgmental 
finally  all long lived assets including capitalized software costs must be assessed for impairment if facts and circumstances warrant such a review 
under the current accounting standard  a long lived asset is impaired if future undiscounted cash flows associated with that asset  without consideration of interest  are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
once deemed impaired  even if by  the long lived asset is written down to its fair value which could be considerably less than the carrying amount or future undiscounted cash flows 
the determination of future cash flows and  if required  the determination of the fair value of a long lived asset  are by their nature  highly subjective judgements 
the company did not capitalize any internal software r d costs  as discussed above  during the years ended december    or in addition  the company did not have any capitalized internal software r d costs included in its december  and consolidated balance sheets 
the company believes that during these periods no material internal software r d costs were required to be capitalized 
the company s conclusion is primarily based on the fact that the feature rich  pre integrated  and highly scalable nature of the company s products requires that the company s development efforts include complex design  coding and testing methodologies  which include next generation software languages and development tools 
development projects of this nature carry a high degree of development risk 
substantially all of the company s internal software r d efforts are of this nature  and therefore  the company believes the period between achieving technological feasibility or the application development stage  as applicable  and the general release of the software to operations is so short that any costs incurred during this period are not material 
intangible assets 
the company frequently obtains intangible assets either individually for example  client contracts or in connection with a basket purchase for example  in a business combination 
the assignment of value to individual intangible assets in a business combination generally requires the use of a specialist  such as an appraiser or valuation expert 
the assumptions used in the appraisal or valuation process are forward looking  and thus subject to significant interpretation 
because individual intangible assets i may be expensed immediately upon acquisition for example  purchased in process r d assets  ii amortized over their estimated useful life for example  acquired software  or iii not amortized at all for example  goodwill  the assigned values could have a material impact on current and future period results of operations 
further  intangible assets are subject to the same judgements when evaluating impairment as discussed above for capitalized software costs 
business combinations 
accounting for business combinations  including the allocation of the purchase price to acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values  requires management in certain circumstances to estimate fair values for items that have no ready market or for which no independent market exists 
management uses its best judgement to determine a fair value based upon inference to other transactions and other data 
as a result  the amounts determined by the company for such items as accounts receivable  identifiable intangible assets  goodwill  and deferred revenue are not individually the result of an arm s length transaction  but are the result of management estimates of the fair value and the allocation of the purchase price 
accordingly  revenue recognized by the company related to fulfillment of assumed contractual obligations is based on fair value estimates made by the company 
in addition  the acquisition of the kenan business resulted in approximately million of goodwill 
such goodwill is subject to review for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if circumstances warrant 
because the review is a fair value based review  there is a high degree of subjective judgement required 
if it is determined that the fair values do not support the carrying value of the goodwill  an impairment charge will be recorded and the amount could be material 
income taxes 
the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process requires the company to estimate the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as purchased in process r d costs  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent recovery is not likely  must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   the company had net deferred tax assets of million  relating primarily to its domestic operations  which represented approximately of total assets 
management believes that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to realize the entire benefit of the company s deferred tax assets 
the assumption of future taxable income  is by its nature  subject to various estimates and highly subjective judgements 
implementation projects in progress the company s gss division provides a variety of implementation services in conjunction with its software arrangements 
the nature of the efforts required to complete the implementations can range from relatively short and noncomplex projects to long and complex projects 
these implementation projects typically range from six to twelve months in length  but can be longer or shorter depending upon the specifics of the project 
lengthy and or complex projects carry a greater degree of business risk than those projects that are short and or noncomplex in nature 
the length and complexity of an individual project is dependent upon many factors 
the company s inability to timely and successfully complete a project and meet client expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
see exhibit under implementation project complexities and risks included in this report for a more detailed discussion of the factors impacting the length and complexity of the company s implementation projects  as well as the related risks resulting from the company s inability to timely and successfully complete a project and meet client expectations 
the company is currently engaged in a lengthy and complex implementation project with a client located in europe in which the company has responsibility for the implementation of certain of its software products  and also has responsibilities for certain aspects of the overall project management 
the project began in and was in progress when the company acquired the kenan business from lucent in february the company assumed the contractual obligations to complete the project from lucent  and originally expected to complete the project in early the project is significantly longer and more complex than the company s typical implementation projects 
the company is using the poc method of accounting for this arrangement 
the company s total estimated professional services revenue to be generated under this arrangement is approximately million 
for the year ended december   the company has recognized revenue under this arrangement of approximately million 
as the company has progressed through this project  the estimated costs and efforts required to complete the project have increased from the company s original expectations due to various work complexities of the project  and as a result of certain project difficulties and other factors experienced in the first quarter of  the company now expects the estimated hours to complete the project to be greater than the estimates that were prepared as of december  as a result  the company now expects to substantially complete the project by the end of the company believes its accounting conclusions made as of december  were based on reasonably dependable estimates of the total hours required to complete the project at that time  and the events that have caused the recent increase in the estimated hours to complete the project occurred subsequent to december   and could not have been reasonably foreseen as of december  as a result of this increase in estimated hours to complete the project  the company s revenue expectations from this arrangement for the first quarter of have decreased significantly  and the overall profitability on the project is now expected to approximate a break even point  and could possibly be in a loss position at march   depending upon the company s final estimates to be prepared as of that date 
furthermore  in addition to standard contractual damages provisions  the arrangement includes performance penalties of approximately million 
such contractual performance penalties may be due as a result of the company missing certain project milestones 
the company has accounts receivable of million million billed and million unbilled recorded as of december  related to this project 
the company has approximately million of fees yet to be invoiced under the arrangement 
the company believes the revised timeline for completion of the project is attainable  and that the client will pay the fees included in accounts receivable as of december   and the future fees yet to be invoiced under the arrangement 
in addition  the company believes it will not be subject to payment of the contractual penalties and or potential damages based on the revised implementation schedule and recent discussions with the client 
because of the various complexities of this project  there can be no assurances that the company will complete the project under its revised schedule and at its revised cost estimate  and avoid the penalties and or potential damages currently included in the arrangement 
additional delays in the project will directly impact the timing of future revenue recognition  the overall profitability on the project  and will likely delay the collection of the fees under the arrangement 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data and the percentage of total revenues of the company for the periods indicated

total revenues increased million  or to million in  from million in the increase between periods related to a increase in processing and related services  a decrease in software revenues  a increase in maintenance revenues  and a increase in professional services revenues 
the decrease in software revenues was due primarily to a decrease in software sales within the broadband division offset  to a certain degree  by the software sales within the gss division 
the increase in maintenance and professional services revenues related primarily to the kenan business acquisition 
see the results of operations operating segments section below for a detailed discussion of revenues and related changes between periods on a segment basis 
cost of processing and related services 
the cost of processing and related services revenues consists principally of i data processing and communications costs  ii statement production costs eg  labor  paper  envelopes  equipment maintenance  etc  iii client support organizations eg  client call centers  account management  etc  iv various product support organizations eg  product management and delivery  product development  etc  and v facilities and infrastructure costs related to the statement production and support organizations 
the cost of processing and related services for increased to million  from million for the increase was due primarily to the increase in the number of customers of the company s clients which were serviced by the company  as discussed in more detail in the results of operations operating segments section below 
processing costs as a percentage of related processing revenues were margin of for compared to margin of for the increase in processing costs as a percentage of related revenue was due primarily to an increase in processing and related costs per customer account between periods  due primarily to increased functionalities and features of the company s processing and related products 
cost of software and maintenance 
the cost of software and maintenance revenues consists principally of i amortization of acquired software and certain acquired client contracts  ii client support organizations eg  client call centers  account management  etc  iii various product support organizations eg  product management and delivery  product maintenance  etc  iv facilities and infrastructure costs related to these organizations  and v third party software costs and or royalties related to certain software products of the company 
the company does not differentiate between cost of software and cost of maintenance revenues  and therefore  such costs are reported on a combined basis 
the costs related to new product development including enhancements to existing products are included in research and development expense 
the combined cost of software and maintenance for increased to million  from million for the increase related primarily to the operations of the kenan business discussed above  which included amortization related to the acquired kenan business intangible assets of approximately million for going forward  amortization related to these intangible assets will be million per month through february  at which time amortization will decrease to million per month through february the cost of software and maintenance as a percentage of related revenues was margin of for as compared to margin of for as discussed below  fluctuations in the gross margin for software and maintenance revenues are an inherent characteristic of software companies and are expected in future periods 
cost of professional services 
the cost of professional services consists principally of i the company s professional services organizations  ii subcontracted professional consultants  and iii facilities and infrastructure costs related to the company s professional services organizations 
the cost of professional services for increased to million  from million for the increase related to the operations of the kenan business discussed above 
the cost of professional services as a percentage of related revenues was margin of for  as compared to margin of for the increase in the cost of professional services as a percentage of the related revenues was due primarily to the decrease in the broadband division s professional services revenues primarily due to lower purchases by comcast and the inclusion of the operations of the kenan business 
as discussed below  fluctuations in the gross margin for professional services revenues are an inherent characteristic of professional services companies and are expected in future periods 
as a result of the kenan business acquisition  the company expects revenues from software and professional services to increase and become a larger percentage of total revenues 
variability in quarterly revenues and operating results are inherent characteristics of companies that sell software and perform professional services 
the company s quarterly revenues for software and professional services revenues may fluctuate  depending on various factors  including the timing of executed contracts and the delivery of contracted services or products 
however  the costs associated with software and maintenance revenues  and professional services revenues are not subject to the same degree of variability ie  these costs are generally fixed in nature within a relatively short period of time  and thus  fluctuations in the cost of software and maintenance as a percentage of related revenues  and the cost of professional services as a percentage of related revenues  will likely occur between periods 
gross margin 
the overall gross margin for  increased to from million for the overall gross margin percentage decreased to for  compared to for the changes in the gross margin and gross margin percentage were due to the factors discussed above 
research and development expense 
r d expense for  increased to million  from million for as a percentage of total revenues  r d expense increased to for  from for the company did not capitalize any internal software development costs during and the increase in the r d expenditures between periods was due primarily to inclusion of r d for the various kenan business products since the closing of the acquisition on february  the company s development and enhancement efforts during were focused primarily on various r d projects for the kenan business  which are discussed in detail in the business acquisitions section above  which includes updates and enhancements to the existing versions of the kenan business product suite  enhancements to csg ccs bp and related software products to increase the functionalities and features of the products  and development of csg nextgen 
following the kenan business acquisition  the company discontinued the development of csg nextgen as a stand alone customer care and billing system  and instead  has focused on integrating certain features and capabilities of csg nextgen into the kenan product suite 
the company expects its investment in r d over time will approximate the company s historical investment rate of of total revenues 
this investment will be focused on the csg ccs bp and the kenan business product suite  as well as additional stand alone products as they are identified 
selling  general and administrative expense 
sg a expense for  increased to million  from million for as a percentage of total revenues  sg a expense increased to for  from for the increase in sg a expense related primarily to operations of the kenan business  and to a lesser degree  an increase in i the company s bad debt expense between years of approximately million  due to an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable established for clients with a high degree of collectibility risk  and ii legal fees in of approximately million related to the comcast litigation  with no comparable amounts included in depreciation expense 
depreciation expense for increased to million  from million for the increase in depreciation expense related to capital expenditures made during in support of the overall growth of the company and depreciation expense related to the acquired fixed assets from the kenan business acquisition 
the capital expenditures during were approximately million and consisted principally of i computer hardware and related equipment  ii statement production equipment  and iii facilities and internal infrastructure expansion 
depreciation expense for all property and equipment is reflected separately in the aggregate and is not included in the cost of revenues or the other components of operating expenses 
kenan business acquisition related expenses 
see the kenan business acquisition section above for a detailed discussion of these expenses 
restructuring charges 
see the restructuring charges section above for a more detailed discussion of the company s restructuring program and related charges for operating income 
operating income for  was million or of total revenues  compared to million or of total revenues for the decrease in these measures between years related to the factors discussed above 
operating income for adjusted for the impact of the kenan business acquisition related expenses and restructuring charges was million  or of total revenues 
see the adjusted results of operations section above for a more detailed discussion of the impact of the kenan business acquisition related expenses and restructuring charges on the company s results of operations 
interest expense 
interest expense for  increased to million  from million for  with the increase due primarily to the company borrowings to finance the kenan business acquisition  as discussed in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the weighted average balance of the company s long term debt for was approximately million  compared to approximately million for the weighted average interest rate on the company s debt borrowings for  including the amortization of deferred financing costs and commitment fees on the company s revolving credit facility  was approximately  compared to for interest and investment income 
interest and investment income for  decreased to million  from million for the decrease was due primarily to lower funds available for investment  and to a lesser degree  the reduction in the returns on invested funds 
other income expense 
other expense for the year ended  was million compared to other income of  for the decrease was due primarily to losses on foreign currency translations during income tax provision 
the company recorded an income tax provision of million  or an effective income tax rate of approximately for the year ended december  the impacts of acquisitions and the company s international expansion of its business primarily as a result of the kenan business acquisition significantly increased the company s effective income tax rate when compared to its effective tax rate of approximately in the company expects that the full year effective income tax rate will be approximately 
the estimate of for is based on various assumptions  with the two primary assumptions related to the company s estimate of total pretax income  and the amounts and sources of foreign pretax income 
the actual effective income tax rate for could deviate from the estimate based on the company s actual experiences with these items  as well as others 
the company is in the process of evaluating its long term international income tax strategy 
the effective income tax rate may be adversely impacted during this interim period based on the location in which future foreign profits and losses are generated 
as of december   the company s net deferred tax assets of million were related primarily to its domestic operations  and represented approximately of total assets 
the company continues to believe that sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets 
the company s assumptions of future profitable domestic operations are supported by its strong operating performances by the broadband division over the last several years 
results of operations operating segments in connection with the kenan business acquisition  the company reorganized its business into two operating segments the broadband division and the gss division 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements and the business section of this document for a further discussion of the operations of each operating segment and the related product and service offerings 
the accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies  to include those discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
management evaluates the performance of the operating segments based on total revenues and contribution margin 
contribution margin is defined as segment operating revenues less segment operating expenses 
there were no material inter segment revenues for the periods presented below 
certain operating expenses managed at the corporate level primarily facilities and other infrastructure support costs and management bonuses  which can be attributed to the operating segments  are allocated as an indirect expense charge to the operating segments 
any costs managed at the corporate level eg  marketing  legal  accounting  etc  which are not attributable to the operating segments  are reflected as corporate overhead costs 
the kenan business acquisition related expenses and restructuring charges are excluded from segment operating expenses 
the company does not allocate activities below the contribution margin level to its reported operating segments 
management s review of segment operating expenses focuses primarily on the functional expenses eg  wages  employee benefits  data processing costs  etc the company s operating segment information and corporate overhead costs for the year ended december  and  are presented below in thousands

total broadband division revenues for decreased to million  from million for processing revenues for increased by to million  from million for of the total increase in processing revenues  approximately resulted from an increase in the number of customers of the company s clients which were serviced by the company and approximately was due to increased revenue per customer 
customers served were as follows in thousands as of december  increase decrease video internet telephony total the increase in the number of customers serviced was due to the conversion of additional customers by new and existing clients to the company s systems  and internal customer growth experienced by existing clients 
during  the company converted and processed approximately  new customers on its systems 
as of december   the company had no customers in its conversion backlog 
total annualized processing revenue per video and internet account was as follows year ended december  increase decrease video account internet account the change in processing revenues per video account related primarily to i changes in the usage of ancillary services by clients  ii the introduction of new products and services and the clients use of these products and services  and iii price changes included in client contracts eg  price escalators for inflationary factors  tiered pricing  eg the decrease in processing revenues per internet account was due primarily to i the ability of internet clients to spread their processing costs  some of which are fixed  across a larger customer base  ii lower pricing tiers due to volume growth in customers processed for certain clients  and iii lower usage of ancillary services 
for the fourth quarter of  the annualized processing revenue per video account was  and per internet account 
the fourth quarter of processing revenue included project requests by the company s clients that generated incremental fees 
adjusting for these fees  which may not recur  the annualized processing revenue per video account would have been approximately 
for  the company expects the annualized processing revenue per video account to range between and  and between and per internet account 
software revenue for decreased by to million  from million for the decrease in software revenue was due primarily to lower software purchases by comcast during as compared to maintenance revenue for increased by to million  from million for the increase in maintenance revenue was due primarily to an increase in the usage of the company s broadband division software products

corporate corporate operating expenses 
corporate overhead expenses for  increased to million  from million for the increase in operating expenses related primarily to the additional marketing and administrative costs to support the company s overall growth 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity 
as of december   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 
the company generally invests its excess cash balances in low risk  short term investments to limit its exposure to market risks 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the short term investments 
the company also has a revolving credit facility in the amount of million  under which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december  the company s ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility is subject to a limitation of total indebtedness based upon the results of a leverage ratio calculation  as determined in the company s credit agreement 
as of december   all of the million revolving credit facility was available to the company 
the entire amount of the revolving credit facility is expected to be available through mid may subsequent to that date  through the end of  based on the company s projected leverage ratios  a minimum of approximately million will be available under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility expires in february the company generally has ready access to substantially all of its cash and short term investment balances  but does face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions 
as of december   the cash and short term investments subject to such limitations were not significant 
in addition  the company s credit facility places certain restrictions on the amount of cash that can be freely transferred between certain operating subsidiaries 
these restrictions are not expected to cause any liquidity issues at the individual subsidiary level in the foreseeable future 
accounts receivable 
as of december  and  the company had million and million  respectively  in net billed trade accounts receivable 
the company s trade accounts receivable balance includes billings for several non revenue items primarily postage  sales tax  and deferred revenue items 
as a result  the company evaluates its performance in collecting its accounts receivable through its calculation of days billings outstanding dbo rather than a typical days sales outstanding dso calculation 
dbo is calculated based on the billing for the period including non revenue items divided by the average monthly net trade accounts receivable balance for the period 
the company s dbo calculations for the three months ended december  and  were days and days  respectively 
the increases in the net billed trade accounts receivable and dbo discussed in the preceding paragraph relate primarily to i continued revenue growth of the company  to include the activity of the acquired kenan business  ii the timing of payments across december  year end by certain clients  and iii a greater percentage of the company s accounts receivable being generated within the gss division from software and professional services transactions with international telecommunications service providers 
the kenan business acquisition has changed the principal concentration of credit risk related to accounts receivable  as the company has moved from having its primary clients being large  established cable television and satellite companies located in the us  to being a wide range of telecommunications service providers located throughout the world 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the detail of the company s billed accounts receivable by geographic region 
as expected  such changes in the client base have increased the company s accounts receivable balance and adversely impacted dbo as longer billing cycles ie  billing terms and cash collection cycles are an inherent characteristic of international software and professional services transactions 
for example  the company s ability to bill ie  send an invoice and collect arrangement fees may be dependent upon  among other things  the i completion of various client administrative matters  local country billing protocols and processes  and or non client administrative matters  ii company meeting certain contractual billing milestones  or iii overall project status in certain situations in which the company acts as a subcontractor to another vendor on a project  as well as other circumstances as described elsewhere in this document 
in particular  during  the company had two large implementation projects in progress in the asia pacific region where the company was executing on the implementation projects generally as expected  but for which accounts receivable balances of approximately million million billed and million unbilled existed as of december  the company had expected to bill and collect a substantial percentage of these amounts by the end of the first quarter of  but due to various complications in the billing and cash collection cycle related to these two arrangements  the company now expects to collect a substantial percentage of the amounts by the end of the second quarter of although the company believes the amounts due under these arrangements are fully collectible  because of the various circumstances experienced with these arrangements to date  there can be no assurances that the company will bill and collect these amounts within the expected time frames 
in addition  as discussed above  the economic state of the global telecommunications industry continues to be depressed which also has an adverse impact on the normal cash collection cycles 
since most of the company s current and future clients operate within this industry sector  the economic state of this industry directly impacts the company s business  potentially increasing the likelihood of uncollectible amounts from current and future accounts receivable and lengthening the cash collection cycle 
for this reason  and because of the expectations for longer billing cycles  as discussed in the preceding paragraph  the company has set its target dbo range at days 
the net billed accounts receivable balances includes an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million and million  respectively  as of december   and the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts relates primarily to specific allowances established for clients with a high degree of collectibility risk as of the end of  including pre bankruptcy accounts receivable from adelphia communications corporation 
adelphia filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter on june  as of december   the company believes it has adequately reserved for its collectibility exposure on its accounts receivable 
revenue recognized prior to the scheduled billing date of an item is reflected as unbilled accounts receivable 
as of december  and  the company had million and million  respectively  of unbilled accounts receivable  with the increase attributed primarily to the gss division 
unbilled accounts receivable are an inherent characteristic of software and professional services transactions  as these types of transactions typically have scheduled invoicing terms over several quarters  as well as certain milestone billing events 
the company expects software and professional services revenues to become an increasingly larger percentage of its total revenues in the future 
consequently  the company s unbilled accounts receivable have increased over historical levels experienced prior to the kenan business acquisition 
the december  unbilled accounts receivable balance consists primarily of several large transactions with various milestone billing dates which have not yet been reached 
substantially all of the december  unbilled accounts receivable are scheduled to be billed and paid by the end of the second quarter of there can be no assurances that the fees will be collected within the expected time frames 
as part of the kenan business acquisition  the company acquired billed and unbilled accounts receivable from lucent 
as of december   these accounts receivable  which reflect an estimate for doubtful accounts  were million  compared to million as of march  the decrease relates primarily to cash collections since that date  and to a lesser degree  adjustments to the estimated fair value of the accounts receivable  resulting primarily from the final audit of the kenan business net assets received during the second quarter of since these acquired accounts receivable relate to lucent s operations of the kenan business prior to the company s ownership  these amounts are being tracked and reported on separately from the company s trade accounts receivable 
purchased kenan business accounts receivable are not included in the company s determination of dbos  as these accounts receivable have certain aging and collection characteristics that the company believes would not accurately reflect the company s actual collection performance on its billed trade accounts receivable  as measured by its dbo calculation 
software and goodwill 
as of december   the company had million of software and million of goodwill  compared to million and million  respectively  as of december  the increase relates to various acquisitions during the year  as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
other non current assets

accounts payable and accrued employee compensation 
as of december  and  the company had million and million  respectively  of trade accounts payable and accrued employee compensation 
the increase relates to the continued growth of the company s business during  including the impact of the kenan business acquisition 
deferred revenues 
as of december  and  the company had million and million  respectively  of deferred revenues  with the increase primarily due to the kenan business acquisition 
a substantial percentage of the december  deferred revenue balance consists of deferred software maintenance revenues  which are recognized to revenue ratably over the service period 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional detail of deferred revenue by revenue source as of december  and the company recorded certain deferred revenues as part of its purchase accounting for the kenan business acquisition 
those deferred revenues represent the estimated fair value of the contractual obligations assumed by the company as of the acquisition date to complete various professional service contracts and software maintenance contracts 
as the company fulfills these obligations  it recognizes the appropriate amount of revenue 
other non current liabilities 
as of december  and  the company had other non current liabilities of million and zero  respectively  with the increase related primarily to restructuring reserves related to the facilities abandonments  as discussed in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
deferred employee compensation 
as of december  and  the company had deferred employee compensation of million and zero  respectively  with the increase related to restricted stock grants made in  as discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
cash flows 
the company s net cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
approximately million of the decrease between periods relates to the company s agreement to extend the payment terms on a large software transaction across its yearend  thus distorting the cash flows from operations for factoring out the impact of scheduling this payment across yearend  cash flows from operations for would have been million 
the remaining decrease in cash flows from operations relates primarily to a reduction in earnings between periods 
the company s net cash flows used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase between periods relates primarily to the increase in acquisitions of million between years principally  the kenan business  offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of million  and a decrease of million related to short term investment activities 
the company s net cash flows provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to the use of million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase between periods can be attributed to i the company borrowing million to finance the kenan business acquisition and retire its previous bank debt  and ii a decrease in stock repurchases between years of million 
this net increase is offset by an increase in debt payments of million including deferred financing costs  and a reduction in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants between periods of million 
adjusted ebitda 
adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda for was million compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of 
in the company s earnings news release for the quarter and year ended december   which was dated january   as well as other public discussions since that date  the company disclosed quarterly and annual adjusted ebitda of million and million  respectively 
as a result of the company s final audit of its financial statements which was completed subsequent to the earnings release date  the company has reduced the quarterly and annual adjusted ebitda amounts by million 
as a result  the final adjusted ebitda for the quarter and the year ended december  is million and million as disclosed below 
the company s adjusted ebitda calculation presented here is defined by the company s current credit facility  which may differ from the ebitda calculation for other companies 
the company s adjusted ebitda is calculated by beginning with net income  adding back i income tax provision  ii interest expense  iii depreciation and amortization  iv acquisition related expenses to include the kenan business acquisition related expenses  v any extraordinary  unusual or non recurring expenses or losses which  by definition in the company s credit facility  include the restructuring charges  and vi any other non cash charges  and subtracting i interest income  ii any extraordinary  unusual or non recurring income or gains  iii any other non cash income  and iv any cash payments made in subsequent periods related to any extraordinary  unusual or non recurring expenses or losses 
adjusted ebitda is presented here as it represents one of the company s primary measures of its debt service ability and is a significant component of the company s debt leverage ratio  for which many of the provisions of the company s credit facility are dependent upon 
adjusted ebitda is not intended to represent cash flows for the periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us adjusted ebitda includes certain non cash revenue and expense items as a result of the purchase accounting for the kenan business acquisition 
reconciliation of the company s adjusted ebitda to net income and cash flow from operations is as follows in thousands year ended december  net income income tax provision interest expense depreciation and amortization kenan business acquisition related expenses restructuring charges interest income stock based compensation other non cash charges income adjusted ebitda this reconciling item relates to the non cash portion of the restructuring charges 
year ended december  cash flows from operations income tax provision changes in operating assets and liabilities kenan business acquisition related expenses deferred income taxes tax benefit of stock options exercised interest income interest expense other adjusted ebitda the reconciling item for the kenan business acquisition related expenses relates to certain cash items that are added back in determining adjusted ebitda

as a result of a voluntary principal prepayment in march of million  the next principal payment of million is scheduled for march  the total scheduled principal payments for are million 
the interest rates for the long term debt are chosen at the option of the company and are based on a base rate or libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
the company s credit facility has no prepayment penalties and requires mandatory prepayments if particular events occur  including i certain sales or issuances of the company s common stock  ii the incurrence of certain indebtedness  iii the sale of assets except in the ordinary course of business  iv proceeds received as a result of the termination of material processing services contracts  and v the achievement of a certain level of excess cash flows as defined in the credit facility 
the company is not subject to any mandatory prepayments at this time  and does not expect to be subject to such prepayments in see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of the company s long term debt

as of december   the company had repurchased a total of million shares at a total price of million weighted average price of 
at december   the total remaining number of shares available for repurchase under the program totaled approximately million shares

in addition  as part of its growth strategy  the company is expanding its international business and is continually evaluating potential business and asset acquisitions 
the company had no significant capital commitments as of december  the company believes that cash generated from operating activities  together with its current cash and cash equivalents  and the amount available under its revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for both its short and long term purposes 
the company also believes it has additional borrowing capacity and could obtain additional cash resources by amending its current credit facility  however  the interest rates for any additional indebtedness would likely be higher than the current rates 
off balance sheet arrangements and material contractual obligations

market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and fluctuations and changes in the market value of its short term investments 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company has not historically entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
as of december   the company had long term debt of million  consisting of a tranche a term loan tranche a with an outstanding balance of million  a tranche b term loan tranche b with an outstanding balance of million  and a million revolving credit facility the revolver  with an outstanding balance of zero 
the scheduled principal payments for tranche a and tranche b are as follows in thousands total tranche a loan tranche b loan total payments the interest rates for the revolver and the two tranches of term loans are chosen at the option of the company and are based on a base rate or libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
the base rate represents the higher of the floating prime rate for domestic commercial loans and a floating rate equal to basis points in excess of the federal funds effective rate 
the applicable margin for the tranche b loan is for base rate loans and for libor loans for the entire term of the credit agreement 
the applicable margins for the revolver and tranche a are dependent upon the company s leverage ratio and can range from to for base rate loans and to for libor loans 
for  the applicable margins for the revolver and tranche a were for base rate loans and for libor loans  and the company expects the applicable margins for to remain at these levels  based on the company s current financial projections 
the company believes the carrying amount of the company s long term debt approximates its fair value due to the long term debt s variable interest rate features 
the company has historically selected libor loans as opposed to base rate loans as the basis for determining its interest rates for its long term debt  and the company expects to continue to utilize libor loans in the foreseeable future 
the company has the option of selecting the length of time ranging from one to twelve months that it locks in the libor contract rate 
for the six months ended september   the interest rates for tranche a and tranche b were based upon a contracted libor rate of for a combined interest rate of for tranche a and for tranche b

in addition  the company continually evaluates whether it should enter into derivative financial instruments as an additional means to manage its interest rate risk but as of the date of this filing  has not entered into such instruments 
as of december   the company had long term debt of million 
this debt was retired in february with a portion of the proceeds from the tranche a and tranche b loans 
this retired debt had similar variable interest rate features as the tranche a and tranche b loans discussed above  with the interest rate based on a prime interest rate or libor rate plus an applicable margin  with the applicable margin dependent upon the company s leverage ratio 
the applicable margin for both the prime rate and libor rate was as of december  the company utilized libor loans with similar contract lengths as discussed above for the tranche a and tranche b loans as the primary means to manage its interest rate risk on this long term debt 
the weighted average interest rates libor plus applicable margin on this long term debt during was approximately 
the company did maintain an interest rate collar agreement expired in september as an additional means to manage the interest rate risk on this long term debt 
the company s interest rate risk for its long term debt has increased between december  and primarily due to the million increase in the long term debt balance between periods 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional description of the company s long term debt 
foreign exchange rate risk 
the company s percentage of total revenues generated outside the us for the years ended december   and was and  respectively  with the increase attributable to the kenan business acquisition in february prior to the kenan business acquisition  the company s foreign currency transactions related almost entirely to the operations conducted through its united kingdom uk subsidiary  csg international limited csgi 
csgi s transactions were executed primarily within the uk and generally were denominated in british pounds and us dollars 
exposure to variability in foreign currency exchange rates was not significant due to the small amount of the company s business conducted outside the u 
s  and was further mitigated by the fact that purchases and sales in the uk were typically in the same currency with similar maturity dates and amounts and certain transactions were denominated in us dollars 
the company expects that in the foreseeable future  the percentage of its total revenues to be generated outside the us will be comparable to that of the company has become more exposed to the impact of the changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of the expansion of its international business 
the company has not historically utilized derivative financial instruments for purposes of managing its foreign currency exchange rate risk 
as a general rule  the company s revenue contracts are denominated in us dollars 
thus  any decline in the value of local foreign currencies against the us dollar will result in the company s products and services being more expensive to a potential foreign buyer  and in those instances where the company s goods and services have already been sold  could result in the accounts receivable being more difficult to collect 
the company does at times enter into revenue contracts that are denominated in the currency of the country in which it has substantive operations  principally the united kingdom  brazil  and japan 
this practice serves as a natural hedge to finance the expenses incurred in those locations 
the company is currently evaluating whether it should enter into derivative financial instruments for the purposes of managing its foreign currency exchange rate risk 
a hypothetical adverse change of in yearend exchange rates would not have a material impact upon the company s results of operations 
market risk related to short term investments 
the company s cash and cash equivalents as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
the company s cash balances are typically swept into overnight money market accounts on a daily basis  and at times  are placed into somewhat longer term cash equivalent instruments 
the company has minimal market risk for its cash and cash equivalents due to the relatively short maturities of the instruments 
the company s short term investments as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
the company does not utilize any derivative financial instruments for purposes of managing its market risks related to short term investments 
the company generally invests its excess cash balances in low risk  short term investments to limit its exposure to market risks 
currently  the company utilizes short term investments as a means to invest its excess cash only in the us the day to day management of the company s short term investments is done by the money management branch of one of the largest financial institutions in the us this financial institution manages the company s short term investments based upon strict and formal investment guidelines established by the company 
under these guidelines  investments are limited to highly liquid  short term government and corporate securities that have a credit rating of a p or better
