item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion that follows provides analysis and information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in part ii  item of this report  and the section entitled risk factors and uncertainties included in part i  item of this report 
overview comarco  inc  through its subsidiary comarco wireless technologies  inc 
collectively  we  comarco  or the company  is a leading provider of wireless test solutions for the wireless industry 
comarco also designs and manufactures emergency call box systems and mobile power products for notebook computers  cellular telephones  pdas  and other handheld devices 
during october  we embarked on a plan to divest our non wireless businesses  which included the defense and commercial staffing businesses 
the divestiture plan was completed during november accordingly  our continuing operations consist solely of the operations of comarco wireless technologies  inc cwt 
results of operations continuing operations we have two reportable operating segments wireless test solutions and wireless applications 
see segment reporting in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
wireless test solutions our wireless test solutions business designs and manufactures hardware and software tools for use by wireless carriers  equipment vendors  and others 
radio frequency engineers  professional technicians  and others use these field test applications to design  deploy  and optimize wireless networks  and to verify the performance and quality of service delivered by the networks once deployed 
beginning in fiscal and after several years of robust growth  the wireless industry deteriorated  reflecting slowing subscriber growth  intensifying price competition  reduced access to capital and the need to manage cash flow 
this trend continued through fiscal and there are few indications that this trend will not continue into fiscal wireless carriers have responded to these challenges by reducing capital spending and focusing on projects that can most directly contribute to their revenue 
wireless carriers are now focused on satisfying customer demand for enhanced data services  seamless and comprehensive coverage  improved quality of service  and faster data transmission 
many of these initiatives require capital spending for additional network capacity and next generation technologies  also referred to as g and g technologies 
with reduced availability of capital and the transition to next generation technologies  plans  projects  and capital spending are subject to frequent change as wireless carriers reevaluate and reorder their priorities 
as a result  demand for our g wireless test solutions products has significantly decreased and the spending patterns of the wireless carriers continue to be volatile and difficult to predict 

table of contents in response to these challenging market conditions  we restructured our wireless test solutions business to better address the future needs of our customers and improve our financial performance in markets currently under pressure 
key changes made to our wireless test solutions business in fiscal are as follows we discontinued all g legacy products and introduced seven 
five  our newly developed product platform 
seven 
five is best described as a flexible and scalable hardware platform combined with an open and modular software architecture 
we are now able to utilize the best software development resources to address the complexities of transitioning existing networks from g to g and g wireless technologies  as well as unique customer requirements 
seven 
five has also allowed us to transition our wireless test solutions business to a significantly lower cost structure 
we established an offshore development center odc in chennai  india at the end of fiscal to take advantage of lower cost  highly skilled software development expertise 
we believe this strategy will lower our development costs  as well as reduce our time to market with new products and functionality 
we eliminated our engineering services business 
we began offering engineering services  which were complementary to our wireless test solution products  to wireless carriers and equipment vendors during the fourth quarter of fiscal during the subsequent two years  we were awarded several profitable multi million dollar contracts  as well as numerous smaller engagements 
however  as wireless carriers continue to reduce their spending  the competition to provide engineering services had become more intense 
reduced contract pricing and fewer opportunities have resulted in reduced revenue and profitability for all engineering services providers 
accordingly  we decided to exit the engineering services business and eliminate all related costs 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed our remaining contractual obligations  reduced head count  and sold a portion of the assets used in providing these services 
we recorded non cash asset impairment charges totaling million related to our discontinued legacy products  which included capitalized software development costs  acquired intangible assets  property and equipment  and inventory 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  on february  in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded a non cash charge of million to write down fully the carrying value of the goodwill related to our edx software reporting unit 
this reporting unit is included in our wireless test solutions segment for financial reporting purposes  and the related goodwill was generated through our acquisition of edx engineering  inc during december such charge is reflected as a cumulative effect accounting change 
wireless applications our wireless applications business designs and manufactures emergency call box systems and mobile power products for notebook computers  cellular telephones  pdas  and other handheld devices 
our call box products provide emergency communication over existing wireless networks 
in addition to the call box products  we provide system installation and long term maintenance services 
currently  we have approximately  call boxes installed  the majority of which are serviced and maintained under long term agreements 
the wireless applications business also includes the chargesource family of mobile power products 
our current offering of chargesource products consist of a watt universal ac power adapter  our second generation mobile power system 
by simply changing the compact smarttips connected to the end of the charging cable  the universal ac power adapter is capable of charging and powering multiple target devices  including most notebook computers  cellular telephones  pdas  and other handheld devices 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the chargesource product offering was expanded with the introduction of the watt universal dc power adapter 
this universal dc power adapter allows traveling professionals to use all their existing chargesource smarttips on the road or in the air 
this device connects to the in seat power outlet available on most major airlines or the cigarette lighter plug found in automobiles 
targus currently distributes both these products 

table of contents until recently  most notebook computers required no more than watts of power to operate 
however  the personal computer industry is currently transitioning to notebook computers with increasing power requirements 
as the power requirements increase  so does the size of the original equipment manufacturer oem ac charger sold with the notebook computer 
to address this industry wide trend  we have developed watt universal power adapters that are compatible with all legacy  current  and future notebook computers 
these new chargesource products are able to deliver up to watts of power in a very small form factor 
the new chargesource product family  which is expected to begin shipping during the second quarter of fiscal  consists of the following watt universal ac dc adapter a universal adapter capable of charging most notebook computers requiring up to watts of power  as well as cell phones  pdas  and other handheld devices 
this adapter is used in the office  home  hotel  as well as the automobile and airplane 
watt universal dc adapter a universal adapter capable of charging most notebook computers requiring up to watts of power  as well as cell phones  pdas  and other handheld devices 
this adapter is used in the automobile and airplane 
watt hour universal battery this universal battery is used to charge and operate all notebook computers  cell phones  pdas  and other handheld devices 
watt ac dc adapter designed for those individuals who do not travel with a notebook computer  but have a need for a universal power adapter that can charge cell phones  pdas  dvd players  digital cameras and camcorders  and other handheld devices 
this adapter is used in the office  home  hotel  as well as the automobile and airplane 
the above products work with existing smart tips and are backwards compatible with the watt adapters  which are expected to be phased out of production during the first quarter of fiscal early in fiscal and in cooperation with the us consumer product safety commission cpsc  we announced a voluntary product safety recall of approximately  detachable plugs used on our chargesource watt universal ac power adapter 
the detachable ac plug can crack if the plug s swivel connector is extended beyond the degrees of allowed rotation  creating the potential for electric shock 
to date  no injuries have been reported 
approximately  units are believed to be in consumer s hands  while another  are currently in the distribution channel 
in conjunction with the product safety recall  the company and targus entered into an agreement addressing the impact of the recall action 
due to the recall action and the agreement with targus  we have accrued a million credit to targus as a reduction of sales and additional recall costs of approximately million classified in cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal actual amounts may differ materially from our current estimates based on many factors  including the number of qualifying watt universal adapters returned to comarco by targus and their customers  primarily consumer electronics retailers 

table of contents the following table sets forth certain items as a percentage of revenue from our audited consolidated statements of income for fiscal   and years ended january  revenue products services cost of revenue products services gross profit products services selling  general and administrative costs asset impairment charges engineering and support costs operating income loss before severance costs severance costs operating income loss other income  net minority interest in earnings loss of subsidiary income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss from continuing operations consolidated revenue total revenue for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of approximately million or percent 
as discussed below  the decrease is attributable to decreased sales of our wireless test solution products and services  partially offset by increased sales of our wireless applications products 
total revenue for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million or percent 
the increase is due to a million increase in sales of our wireless applications products  partially offset by a million decrease in sales of our wireless test solution products 
for fiscal as compared to the prior year  revenue from products decreased percent to million while revenue from services decreased percent to million 
the product revenue decrease reflects the continuing softness in the wireless industry and decreased demand for our wireless test solution products  which declined million or percent  offset by an increase in sales of our chargesource products of million or percent  net of a million credit issued to our exclusive distributor in conjunction with the product safety recall of our watt universal chargesource power adapter 
see the section entitled chargesource product safety recall for additional discussion 
the services revenue decrease was due to our exit from the engineering services business during the second quarter of fiscal revenue from engineering services totaled and million for fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents for fiscal as compared to the prior year  revenue from products increased percent to million while revenue from services increased percent to million 
the product revenue growth was due to increased sales from our wireless applications segment  partially offset by decreased sales from our wireless test solutions segment 
the services revenue growth was due to increased sales of engineering services from our wireless test solutions segment 
cost of revenue and gross margin total cost of revenue for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of approximately million or percent 
cost of revenue for fiscal included a non cash inventory impairment charge  totaling approximately million 
this inventory impairment charge is attributable to our wireless test solutions business 
see the section below entitled asset impairment charges for additional discussion 
cost of revenue for fiscal also included approximately million of costs accrued in connection with the product safety recall of our chargesource watt universal power adapters 
see the section below entitled chargesource product safety recall for additional discussion 
excluding the inventory impairment and product safety recall charges  total cost of revenue for fiscal was million 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin for fiscal decreased to percent compared to percent for the prior fiscal year 
as discussed below  the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a change in our mix of business  our exit from engineering services  and the negative effect of significantly reduced sales and decreasing gross margins of our historically higher margin wireless test solution products 
total cost of revenue for fiscal increased percent to million compared with fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross margin decreased slightly to percent from percent for fiscal while the gross margin for fiscal was comparable to the prior year  it was a result of increased sales volumes and margins of our wireless applications products offset by decreased sales volumes and margins of our wireless test solution products 
selling  general and administrative costs selling  general and administrative costs for fiscal were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  a decrease of million or percent 
this decrease was due to reduced staffing levels  selling expenses  and incentive compensation driven by significantly reduced sales of our wireless test solution products and services 
additionally  as of february  and in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative costs included million of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
selling  general and administrative costs for fiscal increased percent to million compared to fiscal excluding costs attributable to edx engineering  inc edx  which was acquired on december   selling  general and administrative costs for fiscal decreased million in comparison to the prior year 
this decrease was driven by lower sales of our wireless test solutions products during fiscal  as well as enterprise wide cost reductions that were put in place during fiscal these cost reductions  including eliminating direct sales and marketing efforts for our chargesource mobile power products  closing the sales and support office in london  and reorganizing our call box systems business  resulted in a significant reduction of indirect costs 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative costs were percent  percent  and percent for fiscal   and   respectively 
asset impairment charges due to reduced demand for existing wireless test solutions products in the wireless marketplace and our strategy of investing available resources in the development of seven 
five  our new product platform  we have analyzed the carrying value of all assets attributable to our wireless test solutions business 
based on this analysis  we 
table of contents recorded asset impairment charges totaling million during the second quarter of fiscal the following table sets forth the impaired assets and corresponding impairment charges in thousands property and equipment software development costs goodwill and acquired intangible assets in addition to the asset impairment charges above  an inventory impairment charge totaling million was recorded as cost of revenue during the second quarter of fiscal the above impaired assets  as well as the inventory impairment charge are exclusively related to our legacy g wireless test solutions products and do not include any assets related to our engineering services business  which ceased operations during the second quarter of fiscal cumulative effect of accounting change as discussed in note of the accompanying financial statements  the company adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective february  during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the required transitional impairment test under the new rules and recorded a non cash charge of million to write down fully the carrying value of the goodwill related to our edx software reporting unit 
this reporting unit is included in our wireless test solutions segment for financial reporting purposes  and the related goodwill was generated through our acquisition of edx engineering  inc during december such charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
in calculating the impairment charge  the fair value of the impaired reporting unit underlying the wireless test solutions segment was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this charge writes off the entire carrying value of the recorded goodwill and accordingly  million was recorded as a cumulative charge for the fiscal year ended january  no comparable charge was recorded during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
chargesource product safety recall as discussed above  early in fiscal and in cooperation with the us cpsc  we announced a voluntary product safety recall of approximately  detachable plugs used on our chargesource watt universal ac power adapter 
in conjunction with the product safety recall  the company and targus  exclusive distributor of the chargesource products  entered into an agreement addressing the impact of the recall action 
accordingly  we have accrued both a million credit due to targus reducing sales and additional recall costs of approximately million classified in cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal engineering and support costs the company capitalizes costs incurred for the development of software embedded in our wireless test solutions products that will be sold when technological feasibility has been established 
these capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future revenue and changes in hardware and software technologies 
costs that are capitalized include direct labor and related overhead 
engineering and support costs for fiscal and are as follows january  in thousands engineering less capitalized software development support costs 
table of contents engineering and support costs  net of capitalized software development costs  for fiscal were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of approximately million 
gross engineering and support costs  before reduction for capitalized software development costs  decreased million in comparison to fiscal this decrease is a result of our strategy of reducing the cost structure supporting our wireless test solutions business and developing a single flexible product platform 
offsetting this cash savings and consistent with the reduction in the number of on going software development programs  capitalized software development costs decreased million resulting in an increase in engineering and support costs  net of capitalized software development costs  of million for fiscal in comparison to the prior fiscal year 
engineering and support costs for fiscal and are as follows january  in thousands engineering less capitalized software development support costs engineering and support costs  net of capitalized software development costs  for fiscal increased percent to million compared to fiscal excluding costs attributable to edx  engineering and support costs net of capitalized software development for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
this increase was partially offset by increased capitalized software development costs totaling million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increases in gross engineering and capitalized software development costs were primarily due to continued investment in our hardware and software product development programs  which included gprs and xrtt products g technologies  as well as g scanners and related applications 
severance costs during the second quarter of fiscal and in conjunction with the disposition of our non wireless businesses  we were required to record a million charge to continuing operations for costs related to severance agreements for outgoing corporate staff 
no similar costs were recorded in fiscal and other income other income  consisting primarily of interest income  decreased approximately million to million for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on invested cash balances 
other income increased  to million for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of higher invested cash balances for much of the fiscal year 
income tax expense the effective tax rate for fiscal   and was percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate used to compute the income tax benefit for fiscal is due to permanent differences in our taxable loss for fiscal as a result of non deductible intangible asset impairment charges 

table of contents wireless test solutions years ended january  in thousands revenue cost of revenue cost of goods sold software development amortization inventory impairment total cost of revenue gross profit gross margin revenue wireless test solutions revenue for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of approximately million or percent 
this decrease reflects the reduced demand for our legacy g wireless test solution products  as well as engineering services  which we ceased providing during the second quarter of fiscal revenue from engineering services for fiscal and totaled million and million  respectively 
for fiscal   and  customers of our wireless test solutions business accounted for percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of our annual revenue  and percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of our annual gross profit 
due to the uncertainties associated with the spending patterns of our customers and the corresponding demand for our wireless test solution products  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in demand 
such fluctuations have caused and may continue to cause significant reductions in revenue and or operating income  negatively affecting our business  financial condition  and operating results 
we are currently unable to predict when the downturn in the wireless industry will cease to have a negative impact on our revenues and operating results 
revenue from our wireless test solutions business for fiscal was million  a decrease of million or percent compared to fiscal as previously discussed  the downturn in the wireless industry  which first impacted us in early fiscal  reduced overall demand for our wireless test solution products 
cost of revenue and gross margin wireless test solutions cost of revenue for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of approximately million or percent 
as discussed above  during fiscal  we recorded a non cash inventory impairment charge totaling approximately million 
excluding this asset impairment charge  wireless test solutions cost of revenue for fiscal was million 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin for fiscal decreased to percent compared to percent for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to decreased absorption of fixed costs attributable to dramatically lower revenue 
cost of revenue from our wireless test solutions business for fiscal was million  a decrease of million or percent compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross margin decreased to percent from percent for fiscal the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to decreased sales volumes of hardware and software tools 
the decrease in gross margin is attributable to decreased absorption of manufacturing overhead expenses and increased labor costs  when viewed as a percentage of revenue  driven by lower sales of our hardware and software tools 

table of contents wireless applications years ended january  in thousands revenue cost of revenue cost of goods sold software development amortization inventory impairment total cost of revenue gross profit gross margin revenue wireless applications revenue for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million or percent 
this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our chargesource mobile power products 
our combined chargesource sales increased approximately million to million for fiscal  net of the million credit issued to our exclusive distributor in conjunction with the product safety recall of our chargesource watt universal ac power adapter  as discussed above 
wireless applications revenue for fiscal was million  an increase of million or percent compared to fiscal the increase was attributable to increased sales of the chargesource watt universal ac power adapter  our second generation mobile power system that began shipping during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the introduction of the new chargesource watt universal dc power adapter that began shipping during the third quarter of fiscal both chargesource products are currently distributed exclusively by targus under non cancelable commitments 
in the event targus is unable to perform under these commitments due to their inability to take delivery of ordered products and or pay for such products in a timely manner  we would be required to establish alternative distribution channels 
the financial impact of a material change in our relationship with targus cannot be precisely quantified  but we believe that a six to twelve month disruption in the distribution of our chargesource products would have a negative impact on our revenue and operating results  which could also result in decreased liquidity 
for fiscal   and  sales to targus totaled approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
cost of revenue and gross margin wireless applications cost of revenue for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million or percent 
excluding the cost of the product safety recall  cost of revenue for fiscal was million 
as a percentage of revenue and excluding the credit and costs associated with the product safety recall  gross margin for fiscal increased to percent from percent for fiscal the increase in wireless applications gross margin is primarily attributable to several higher margin call box upgrade projects completed during fiscal cost of revenue of our wireless applications business for fiscal was million  an increase of million or percent compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross margin increased to percent from percent for fiscal the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to increased sales volumes of our chargesource mobile power products 

table of contents discontinued operations as discussed above  we embarked on a plan to divest our non wireless businesses  which included the defense and commercial staffing businesses 
the divestiture plan was completed during november net loss from discontinued operations was  for fiscal  which includes net income during phase out of  on revenue of million  less an after tax loss of  on the disposition of our non wireless businesses 
liquidity and capital resources our financial position remains strong  with cash and cash equivalents of million as of january  cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities is primarily derived from the sale of our products and services 
cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities during the year ended january  was primarily a result of our net income from continuing operations before non cash charges including cumulative effect of accounting change  asset impairment charges  provision for obsolete inventory  and depreciation and amortization  collection of million of accounts receivable offset by a net change in deferred income taxes of million  a decrease in current liabilities of million  and an increase in both inventory and other assets of million each 
early in fiscal and in cooperation with the us cpsc  we announced a voluntary product safety recall of approximately  detachable plugs used on our chargesource watt universal ac power adapter 
the detachable ac plug can crack if the plug s swivel connector is extended beyond the degrees of allowed rotation  creating the potential for electric shock 
to date  no injuries have been reported 
approximately  units are believed to be in the hands of consumers  while another  are currently in the distribution channel 
in conjunction with the product safety recall  the company and targus entered into an agreement addressing the impact of the recall action 
due to the recall action and the agreement with targus  we have accrued a million credit to targus as a reduction of sales and additional recall costs of approximately million classified in cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal the credit to targus is based on unsold and unopened units in the distribution channel expected to be returned to us within a six month period 
the accrued additional recall costs are related to replacing ac plugs in the hands of consumers 
our methodology for estimating the additional recall costs involved estimating future costs to be incurred to replace the recalled ac plug based on expected returns and the costs to conduct the recall  particularly communication  replacement  and transportations costs 
our replacement and transportation cost estimates include costing for component parts and labor  we also obtained third party cost quotes for communication  fulfillment and administration services 
the expected percentage of ac plugs to be replaced out of  units believed to be in the hands of consumers is an important assumption 
our current assumption is that approximately percent of those units in the hands of the consumers will be replaced 
to help understand the relative impact of the return rate assumption  a percent point increase in the return rate would increase the estimated additional recall costs from million to million 
we expect our cash outlays associated with this product safety recall to be financed from our existing cash balances 
the decrease in cash generation from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to a significant decrease in current liabilities and amounts accrued in conjunction with the disposition of our non wireless businesses during fiscal also contributing to the decrease in cash generation was a million increase in inventory 
this increase is related to the introduction of our chargesource watt universal dc power adapter that went into production during the third quarter of fiscal additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also increased our inventory of certain components in anticipation of fourth quarter sales of our wireless test solution 
table of contents products 
however  fourth quarter sales were lower than anticipated and historical levels 
these components were primarily consumed or written off during fiscal cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal in all periods  capital expenditures for property and equipment  acquisitions  and software development constituted substantially all of our cash used in investing activities 
the development of software is critical to our products currently under development 
on july   the company acquired an percent equity stake in swissqual for million in cash 
based in zuchwil  switzerland  swissqual is a developer of voice quality systems and software for measuring  monitoring  and optimizing the quality of mobile  fixed  and ip based voice and data communications 
under this alliance  comarco and swissqual will jointly develop  sell  and support wireless network quality of service and optimization products for the european marketplace 
in addition to expanding our access to european wireless carriers  swissqual will provide domain expertise and development guidance in the evolution of g and g system test solutions 
on december   we acquired all the outstanding common stock of edx for  shares of our common stock  valued at million on the day the transaction closed  and million in cash 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal as compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal and net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal in all periods  proceeds from the sales of common stock issued through employee and director stock option plans  offset by the repurchase of our common stock  constituted substantially all of our cash provided by and used in financing activities 
during  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million shares of our common stock 
from program inception through january   we repurchased approximately million shares for an average price of per share 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares in the open market for an average price of per share 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances will provide us sufficient funds to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in addition to our cash and cash equivalent balances  we expect to derive a portion of our liquidity from our cash flows from operations 
as discussed above  certain factors and events could negatively affect our cash flows from operations  including due to the uncertainties associated with the spending patterns of our customers and the corresponding demand for our wireless test solutions products  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in demand 
such fluctuations have caused and may continue to cause significant reductions in revenue and operating results  in the event targus  the exclusive distributor of our chargesource products  is unable to perform under their non cancelable commitments due to their inability to take delivery of the products and or pay for such products in a timely manner  we would be required to establish alternative distribution channels 
we are focused on preserving our cash balances by continuously monitoring expenses  identifying cost savings  and investing only in those development programs and products most likely to contribute to our profitability 

table of contents critical accounting policies we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition  software development costs  accounts receivable  inventory  income taxes  valuation of goodwill  and valuation of long lived assets 
revenue recognition we generally recognize product revenue upon shipment of products provided there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is deemed probable 
for our wireless test solution products that are integrated with embedded software  we recognize revenue using the residual method pursuant to requirements of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
under the residual method  we allocate revenue to the undelivered element  typically maintenance  based on its respective fair value  determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
we recognize service revenue as the services are performed 
maintenance revenue from customer support and product upgrades  including maintenance bundled with the original product sale  is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  typically months 
revenue for services under long term contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method on the basis of percentage of costs incurred to date on a contract  relative to the estimated total contract costs 
profit estimates on long term contracts are revised periodically based on changes in circumstances and any losses on contracts are recognized in the period that such losses become know 
significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments 
software development costs we capitalize software developed for sale or lease in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
software costs incurred subsequent to the determination of the technological feasibility of the software product are capitalized 
our policy is to capitalize the costs associated with development of new products but expense the costs associated with new releases  which consist of enhancements or increased functionality of software imbedded in our existing products 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether technological feasibility has been achieved for a particular software project 
capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software product is available for general release to customers 
capitalized software development costs  net of related amortization  are compared to management s estimate of projected revenues quarterly to determine if any impairment in value has occurred that would require an adjustment in the carrying value or change in expected useful lives under the guidelines established under sfas no 
we also continually evaluate the recoverability of software acquired through acquisition or by direct purchase of technology 
we have million of capitalized software as of january   net of accumulated amortization of million 
capitalized software amortization expense is included in cost of revenue 
the amortization period for the software costs capitalized is the shorter of the economic life of the related product  or based on expected unit sales under the sales ratio method  typically two to four years 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and related terms based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
management analyzes specific customer accounts  historical bad debt  trends  customer concentrations  customer 
table of contents credit worthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our losses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory calculated on average costs  which approximates first in  first out basis or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
as demonstrated during fiscal  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our forecasts of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results 
income taxes we assess our deferred tax assets to determine the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that we will not realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we will establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which will be charged to income tax expense in the period of such determination 
valuation of goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment annually or on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether an indicator of impairment exists and projecting cash flows 

table of contents in our fiscal year ended january   sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and  as a result we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill acquired prior to july  we recorded million of amortization on these amounts during fiscal in lieu of amortization  we perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible balance upon the initial adoption of sfas no 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the required transitional impairment test under the new rules and recorded a non cash charge of million to write down fully the carrying value of the goodwill related to our edx reporting unit 
the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets impact future amortization 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets  when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns that negatively impact our customers or markets  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of assets is impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using a weighted average of the market approach and the discounted expected future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our cost of capital 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected discounted cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these assets 
in that event  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long lived assets could be required

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency risk we are exposed to the risk of changes in currency exchange rates 
as of january   we had no material accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
our standard terms require customers to pay for our products and services in us dollars 
for those orders denominated in foreign currencies  we may limit our exposure to losses from foreign currency transactions through forward foreign exchange contracts 
to date  sales denominated in foreign currencies have not been significant and we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to minimize this risk  we maintain a significant portion of our cash balances in money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents have maturities dates of three months or less and the fair value approximates the carrying value in our financial statements 
equity price risk our short term investments consist primarily of balances maintained in a non qualified deferred compensation plan funded by our executives and directors 
we value these investments using the closing market value for the last day of each month 
these investments are subject to market price volatility 
we reflect these investments on our balance sheet at their market value  with the unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings 
we have also invested in equity instruments of swissqual  a privately held company 
we evaluate whether any decline in value of certain public and non public equity investments was other than temporary 
we had no such impairments during fiscal due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments  and in light of current stock market conditions  we may incur future losses on the sales  write downs  or write offs of our investments 
we do not currently hedge against equity price changes
