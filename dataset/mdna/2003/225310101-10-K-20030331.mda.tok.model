item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s business model relies on its ability to forecast loan performance 
the company s forecasts impact loan pricing and structure as well as the required reserve for advance losses 
the following table presents forecasted collection rates  advance rates  the spread the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate  and the percentage of the forecasted collections which have been realized through december  the amounts presented are expressed as a percent of total loan value by year of loan origination 
december  forecasted of forecast year collection advance spread realized the risk of a forecasting error declines as loans age 
for example  the risk of a material forecasting error for business written in is very small  with of the total amount forecasted already realized 
in contrast  the company s forecast for recent loan originations is much less precise 
if the company produces disappointing operating results  it will likely be because the company overestimated future loan performance 
the spread between the forecasted collection rate and the advance rate reduces the company s risk of advance losses 
because collections are applied to advances on an individual dealer partner basis  a wide spread does not eliminate the risk of advance losses  but it does reduce the risk significantly 
one method for evaluating the reasonableness of the company s forecast is to examine the trends in forecasted collection rates over time 
the following table compares the company s forecast as of december  with the forecast as of december  december  december  year forecasted collection forecasted collection variance during  the company experienced a decline in loan performance in north america 
the company believes the decline is temporary and is primarily due to the installation of a new collection system late in the second quarter of however  it is impossible to determine whether external factors  such as economic conditions  also may have contributed to the decline 
as a result of the decline in loan performance  the company s forecast of future collections on its north america portfolio of loans declined approximately and during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the company believes that significant improvement was made during the fourth quarter of collection activity returned to pre system conversion levels as measured by calls and contacts per delinquent account 
the level of charge offs was unsatisfactory in october  but improved significantly in november and december 
the company believes that it is too early to conclude what effect these improvements will have on the provision for losses on advances in the company believes the new collection system will ultimately provide operational efficiencies  and improvements in collection rates  which could not have occurred without the new system

management has assumed a cost of equity equal to of average shareholders equity in its economic profit or loss calculations 
economic profit or loss is a measurement of how efficiently the company utilizes its capital 
the company has used economic profit internally since january  to evaluate its performance 
the company s goal is to maximize the amount of economic profit per share generated 
the company s economic loss increased to  or per adjusted share  in compared to  or per adjusted share  in the following presents the calculation of the company s economic loss and return on capital for the periods indicated dollars in thousands  except per share data for the years ended december  economic loss net income   imputed cost of equity at   total economic loss   adjusted weighted average shares outstanding   economic loss per share return on capital north america united kingdom automobile leasing consolidated consolidated net income from the consolidated statement of income

cost of equity is equal to of average shareholders equity  which was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has added to shareholders equity as reported under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amounts added to shareholders equity represent the average options outstanding for the period multiplied by the weighted average exercise price

differs from shares used for gaap earnings per share  which include only a portion of options outstanding 
economic loss per share equals the economic loss divided by the adjusted weighted average shares outstanding

average capital is equal to the average amount of debt and equity during the period  which includes the additions to shareholders equity as reported under gaap discussed in footnote 
stock options in  the company began granting performance based stock options to employees 
performance based options are options that vest solely based on the achievement of performance targets  in the company s case targets based on either earnings per share or economic profit 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires companies to expense performance based options when it is likely that performance targets will be met and a measurement date can be established 
the amount of the reported expense is the price of the company s stock at the end of each reporting period less the exercise price of the options 
the company s non performance options are not required to be expensed under gaap 
regardless of the accounting  options represent a significant cost to shareholders 
the true cost is the business value transferred to the employee in stock  less the exercise proceeds  a number that is difficult to calculate since it depends on when options are exercised and the future performance of the business 
gaap provides several alternatives for accounting for this cost 
in the company s opinion  none of these alternatives provide a method that accurately captures the true cost of options in all circumstances 
because the company believes that accurately understanding and managing the cost of options is essential  the company has developed the following practices regarding stock options beginning in  options are issued only after shares have first been repurchased in the open market 
in all cases  the option is priced at or above the higher of the fair market value on the date of grant and the average price of the repurchased shares 
for shareholders  the impact of options therefore is that capital used to repurchase shares is no longer available to invest in income producing assets 
this cost  the opportunity cost of the capital used to repurchase shares until the capital is returned upon option exercise  reduces the company s reported earnings 
option grants are predominantly performance based  with appropriately aggressive vesting targets 
the company believes that these options properly align the interests of management and shareholders by rewarding management only for exceptional business performance 
the company s reported economic profit loss includes three adjustments to the company s results reported under gaap to reflect the cost of options 
first  to avoid double counting  the gaap expense recorded for performance options is added back 
second  all options outstanding are included in the company s fully diluted share base 
finally  economic profit loss includes a charge for the capital used to repurchase shares covering options grants 
the company s method of measuring options in the calculation of economic profit loss is conservative in two respects 
first  the tax benefits of future option exercises have not been included in the company s calculation 
because option expense is deducted for tax purposes upon exercise  more capital will be returned to the company upon exercise than is invested in repurchased shares 
second  options may be cancelled due to turnover or the failure to meet performance targets 
cancellations will be factored in as they occur 
one additional risk is assumed 
should options be issued and shares repurchased above intrinsic value  and the options subsequently expire unexercised  a loss equal to the amount paid above intrinsic value would be incurred 
the practice of repurchasing shares to cover option grants has evolved over time 
to date the company has repurchased shares covering all options granted since because the company s option program pre dates the current practice of repurchasing shares  as of december  options to purchase approximately million shares granted prior to have not been covered by repurchases 
depending upon capital availability and other investment opportunities  the company may repurchase shares covering some or all of these uncovered options 
for purposes of computing economic profit  the company includes a capital charge as if these options had been repurchased at the option exercise price at the date of grant 
the company views options as a significant but necessary cost 
in the company s opinion  this cost is accurately measured and charged to economic profit per share  the performance measure on which the company s management incentive compensation system is based 
the company believes the ability to measure the cost of options  combined with an incentive compensation system that includes this cost  enhances the probability that the company s option program will produce favorable results for shareholders 
critical accounting policies and loss experience the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the reserve for advance losses  the allowance for credit losses  and the allowance for leased vehicle losses 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
north america and united kingdom reserve for advance losses 
the company maintains a reserve against advances that are not expected to be recovered through collections on the related loan portfolio 
for purposes of establishing the reserve  the present value of estimated future collections for each dealer partner s loan portfolio is compared to the related advance balance 
the discount rate used for present value purposes is equal to the rate of return expected at the origination of the advance 
to the extent that the present value of future collections is less than the advance balance due from a dealer partner  the company records a reserve equal to the difference between the advance and the present value of the estimated future collections 
the company maintains historical loss experience for each dealer partner on a static pool basis and uses this information to forecast the timing and amount of future collections on each dealer partner s portfolio 
proceeds from one dealer partner s portfolio cannot be used to offset losses relating to another dealer partner 
effective january   the company modified its policy for charging off advances 
advances are charged off when the company s analysis forecasts no future collections relating to such advance balance 
advance losses represent the company s primary credit risk 
the company has recorded two large provisions during its history  one in and the other in both charges related primarily to loan pools originated between and the first related to the initial loss assessment subsequent to the installation of the company s static pool loan information system in the second charge related to a reassessment of the loss based on the subsequent underperformance of these loan pools versus the company s initial assessment 
in addition  in  the company recorded larger than expected provisions for losses on advances in north america resulting from a decline in loan performance in north america 
the company believes the decline is temporary and is primarily related to the installation of a new collection system late in the second quarter of however  it is impossible to determine whether external factors  such as economic conditions  also may have contributed to the decline 
as a result of the decline in loan performance  the company s forecast of future collections on its north america portfolio of loans declined approximately and during the third and fourth quarter respectively 
the company believes that significant improvement was made during the fourth quarter 
collection activity returned to pre system conversion levels as measured by calls and contacts per delinquent account 
the level of charge offs was unsatisfactory in october  but improved significantly in november and december 
the company believes that it is too early to conclude what effect these improvements will have on the provision for losses on advances in the company believes the new collection system will ultimately provide operational efficiencies  and improvements in collection rates  which could not have occurred without the new system 
the company regularly forecasts future collections on its portfolio of loans 
the risk of advance losses increases as the spread between the collection rate and advance rate narrows 
the company s primary protection against future losses relates to managing this spread appropriately by reducing the amount it is willing to advance based upon reductions in anticipated collection rates 
allowance for credit losses 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses that covers earned but unpaid servicing fees on loan receivables in non accrual status 
servicing fees  which are booked as finance charges  are recognized under the interest method of accounting until the underlying obligation is days past due on a recency basis 
at such time  the company suspends the recognition of revenue and makes a provision for credit losses equal to the earned but unpaid finance charges 
once a loan is classified in non accrual status  it remains in non accrual status for the remaining life of the loan 
revenue on non accrual loans is recognized on a cash basis 
loans on which no payment has been received for nine months are charged off 
ultimate losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision  which is a current expense  may be either greater or less than actual losses 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different financial results 
automobile leasing allowance for lease vehicle losses 
the company maintains i a reserve for repossession losses  and ii a reserve for residual losses 
reserve for repossession losses 
the repossession reserve covers losses resulting from the difference between sale proceeds and the net investment in operating leases 
for purposes of establishing the reserve  the company estimates the expected losses  based on its historical loss experience  on its inventory of repossessed vehicles and vehicles being repossessed 
reserve for residual losses 
the residual reserve covers losses resulting from the disposal of vehicles at the end of the lease term 
the company established its residual values based upon an industry guidebook and data from repossessed vehicles sold at auction 
realization of the residual values is dependent on the company s future ability to market the vehicles under then prevailing market conditions 
adverse changes in market conditions from those upon which the estimates were based could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to realize the values estimated and require an increase in the reserve  which may materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
ultimate losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision  which is a current expense  may be either greater or less than actual losses 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different financial results 
the following tables sets forth information relating to the credit provisions  charge offs  and other key credit loss ratios for the years ended december  dollars in thousands provisions for credit losses loans    advances    leased vehicles    total provision for credit losses    charge offs dealer holdbacks    unearned finance charges    allowance for credit losses    total loans charged off    advances    allowance for lease vehicle losses    as of december  ratios allowance for credit losses as a percent of gross loans receivable reserve for advance losses as a percent of advances allowance for lease vehicle losses as a percent of gross investment in operating leases gross dealer holdbacks as a percent of gross loans receivable liquidity and capital resources overview the company s primary sources of capital are cash flows from operating activities  collections on loans receivable  borrowings under the company s credit agreements and secured financings 
the company s principal need for capital has been to fund cash advances made to dealer partners in connection with the acceptance of loans and for the payment of dealer holdbacks to dealer partners who have repaid their advance balances 
when borrowing to fund the operations of its foreign subsidiaries  the company s policy is to borrow funds denominated in the currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates  thus mitigating the company s exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
the company s cash flow requirements are dependent on future levels of loan originations 
in  the company experienced a decrease in originations over due primarily to a reduction in the number of active dealer partners in north america  partially offset by an increase in the number of loans per active dealer partner 
as the reduction in active dealer partners was primarily due to the company exiting dealer partner relationships in that did not meet its return on capital goals  the company does not expect this trend to continue in future periods 
to the extent this loan origination trend does not continue  the company will experience an increase in its need for capital 
the company currently finances its operation through i a bank line of credit facility  ii secured financings  iii a mortgage loan  iv and capital lease obligations 
line of credit facility at december   the company had a million credit agreement with a commercial bank syndicate 
the facility has a commitment period through june   with a one year term out option at the request of the company provided that no event of default exists 
the agreement provides that  at the company s discretion  interest is payable at either the eurodollar rate plus basis points  or at the prime rate as of december  
the eurodollar borrowings may be fixed for periods of up to six months 
borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a borrowing base limitation equal to of advances to dealer partners and leased vehicles as reflected in the consolidated financial statements and related notes  less a hedging reserve not exceeding million  the amount of letters of credit issued under the line of credit  and the amount of other debt secured by the collateral which secures the line of credit 
currently  the borrowing base limitation does not inhibit the company s borrowing ability under the line of credit 
the credit agreement has certain restrictive covenants  including a minimum required ratio of the company s assets to debt  its liabilities to tangible net worth  and its earnings before interest  taxes and non cash expenses to fixed charges 
additionally  the agreement requires that the company maintain a specified minimum level of net worth

in connection with this transaction  the company contributed dealer partner advances having a carrying amount of approximately million to warehouse funding  which  in turn  pledged them as collateral to an institutional investor to secure loans that funded the purchase price of the dealer partner advances 
the proceeds of the secured financings were used by the company to reduce outstanding borrowings under the company s credit facility 
the secured financings create loans for which warehouse funding is liable and are non recourse to the company  even though warehouse funding and the company are consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
such loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to the commercial paper rate plus basis points with a maximum of 
as warehouse funding is organized as a separate legal entity from the company  assets of warehouse funding including the contributed dealer partner advances will not be available to satisfy the general obligations of the company 
substantially all the assets of warehouse funding have been encumbered to secure warehouse funding s obligations to its creditors 
this financing is secured primarily by warehouse funding s dealer partner advances and the company s servicing fee 
the company receives a monthly servicing fee paid by the institutional investor equal to of the collections on funding s loans receivable for the secured financing 
except for the servicing fee and payments due to dealer partners  the company does not receive  or have any rights in  any portion of collections on the loans receivable until warehouse funding s underlying indebtedness is paid in full either through collections on the related loans or through a prepayment of the indebtedness

based upon anticipated cash flows  management believes that cash flows from operations  various financing alternatives available to the company  and amounts available under its credit agreement will provide sufficient financing for debt maturities and for future operations 
the company s ability to borrow funds may be impacted by many economic and financial market conditions 
if the various financing alternatives were to become limited or unavailable to the company  the company s operations could be materially and adversely affected 
market risk the market risk discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the analysis that follows are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results may differ materially due to changes in the company s product and debt mix and developments in the financial markets 
as terrorist acts and acts of war create economic uncertainty and impact the financial markets  such acts could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations and the financial markets in ways that cannot be predicted 
the company is exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manages interest rate risk primarily through interest rate cap agreements  which limit the effective interest rate on the company s secured financings 
the company s policies and procedures prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading purposes 
a discussion of the company s accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk 
the company relies on various sources of financing to assist in funding its operations  some of which is at floating rates of interest and exposes the company to risks associated with increases in interest rates 
the company manages such risk primarily by entering into interest rate cap agreements on certain portions of its floating rate debt 
as of december   the company had million of floating rate debt outstanding on its bank credit facilities  with no interest rate cap protection  and million in floating rate debt outstanding under its secured financing  with an interest rate cap of 
based on the difference between the company s rates on its secured financing at december  and the interest rate cap  the company s maximum interest rate risk on the october secured financing is 
this maximum interest rate risk would reduce annual after tax earnings by approximately million in compared to a million impact in the significant decrease in the impact of secured financing rate fluctuations in is due to the lower debt outstanding under secured financings as of december  compared to for every increase in rates on the company s bank credit facilities  annual after tax earnings would decrease by approximately  in compared to the  impact in this analysis assumes the company maintains a level amount of floating rate debt and assumes an immediate increase in rates 
foreign currency risk 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risk from the possibility of changes in foreign exchange rates that could have a negative impact on earnings or asset and liability values from operations in foreign countries 
the company s most significant foreign currency exposure relates to the united kingdom 
it is the company s policy to borrow and lend in local currencies to mitigate such risks 
an immediate  decrease in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have decreased annual after tax earnings by approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
the potential loss in net asset values from such a decrease would be approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
immediate changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates discussed in the proceeding paragraphs are hypothetical rate scenarios  used to calibrate risk  and do not currently represent management s view of future market developments
