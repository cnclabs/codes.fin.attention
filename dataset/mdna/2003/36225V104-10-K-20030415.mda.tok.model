management discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include contract revenue and cost recognition  valuation of accounts receivables  accounting for investments  impairment of long lived and intangible assets and income tax recognition of deferred tax items which are summarized below 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
contract revenue and cost recognition 
the company provides services under time and materials  cost plus fixed fee and fixed price contracts 
each contract has different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  requiring the company to make judgments and estimates about recognizing revenue 
in general  revenue is recognized on these arrangements as the services are performed 
under time and material contracts  as well as certain cost plus fixed fee and certain fixed price contracts  the contractual billing schedules are based on the specified level of resources the company is obligated to provide 
as a result  on those level of effort contracts  the contractual billing amount for a given period acts as a measure of performance and  therefore  revenue is recognized in that amount 
for other fixed price contracts  the contractual billing schedules are not based on the specified level of resources the company is obligated to provide 
these arrangements typically do not have milestones or other reliable measures of performance 
as a result  revenue on these arrangements is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs expected to be incurred over the term of the contract 
the company believes this methodology provides a reasonable measure of performance on these arrangements since performance primarily involves personnel costs and the customer is required to pay the company for the proportionate amount of work and cost incurred in the event of contract termination 
revenue for unpriced change orders is not recognized until the customer agrees with the changes 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts are recorded as a current asset 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are recorded as a current liability 
generally contracts provide for the billing of costs incurred and estimated earnings on a monthly basis 
risks relating to service delivery  usage  productivity and other factors are considered when making estimates of total contract cost  contract profitability  and progress towards completion 
if sufficient risk exists  a reduced profit methodology is applied to a specific client contract s percentage of completion model whereby the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the amount of costs incurred until such time as the risks have been partially or wholly mitigated through performance 
the company s estimates of total contract cost and contract profitability change periodically in the normal course of business  occasionally due to modifications of contractual arrangements 
in addition  the implementation of cost saving initiatives and achievement of productivity gains generally results in a reduction of estimated total contract expenses on affected client contracts 
such changes in estimate are recognized in the period the changes are determined 
for all client contracts  provisions for estimated losses on individual contracts are made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
as part of the company s on going operations to provide services to its customers  incidental expenses  which are commonly referred to as out of pocket expenses  are billed to customers 
out of pocket expenses include expenses such as airfare  mileage  hotel stays  out of town meals  and telecommunication charges 
the company s policy provides for these expenses to be recorded as both revenue and direct cost of services in accordance with the provisions of eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
valuation of accounts receivables provisions for allowance for doubtful accounts are made based on historical loss experience adjusted for specific credit risks 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of the company s historical loss experience  judgments about customer credit risk  and the need to adjust for current economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total gross trade receivables was and at december  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets with finite lives result in a charge to operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived tangible assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by determining the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the measurement of the future net cash flows to be generated is subject to management s reasonable expectations with respect to the company s future operations and future economic conditions which may affect those cash flows 
in accordance with sfas no 
 which the company adopted in  goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
the company conducted a transitional goodwill impairment test upon adoption of sfas no 
as of january   and its annual goodwill impairment test as of december  the goodwill impairment test requires the company to identify its reporting units and obtain estimates of the fair values of those units as of the testing date 
the company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models 
the company estimates these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value in both tests conducted in indicating the underlying goodwill of each unit was not impaired at the respective testing dates 
the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment tests are based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the estimated fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for impairment and conduct formal tests when impairment indicators are present 
a decline in the fair value of any reporting units below its carrying value is an indicator that the underlying goodwill of the unit is potentially impaired 
this situation would require the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine whether the unit s goodwill is impaired 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
an impairment loss is required for the amount which the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill would become the new cost basis of the unit s goodwill 
the following table presents goodwill balances at december  and operating income for the years ended december   and for each of our reportable segments in thousands goodwill at operating income december  for the years ended december manufacturing process     information technology    optical plastics   accounting for investments at december  and  the company owned approximately and  respectively of fsp and accounts for its investment in fsp using the equity method 
at december   the company s investment in fsp was  including a  senior unsecured note 
the company currently owns approximately of the outstanding common stock of fsp and would own approximately if certain stock options beneficially owned by the company s officers were exercised 
as of december   three officers of the company served on the board of fsp out of a total of seven directors  one of whom resigned effective march  however  effective august  the company entered into a voting agreement which limits its operating and financial control of fsp 
pursuant to an amendment of such agreement  the company agreed that until june   it would vote its shares of common stock of fsp i such that not more than of fsp s directors will be officers or directors of the company and ii in the same manner and in the same proportion as the remaining stockholders of fsp vote on all matters presented to a vote of stockholders  other than the election of directors 
therefore  the company accounts for its investment in fsp under the equity method 
at december  and  the company owned approximately and  respectively  of gses with a carrying value of  and  respectively  and accounts for its investment in gses using the equity method 
although the company owns approximately of the common stock of gses as of december   the company has accounted for its investment in gses using the equity method of accounting based upon management s conclusion that the company has significant influence with respect to the operations of gses 
the company currently owns of hms s common stock but no longer has financial and operating control of hms 
as a condition of a private placement of preferred stock in december  the company contractually gave up operating control over hms through an investors rights agreement 
therefore  through december   the operating results of hms were consolidated within the consolidated statements of operations 
however  subsequent to that date the company accounts for its investment in hms under the equity method 
due to hms s operating losses during  the company s investment in hms as of december  was written down to zero 
income tax recognition the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon these factors  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance primarily relates to foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which the company does not believe the benefits will be realized 
restructuring reserves the company adopted restructuring plans  primarily related to its open enrollment it business  in and in order to identify and calculate the associated costs to exit this business  management made assumptions regarding estimates of future liabilities for operating leases and other contractual obligations  severance costs and the net realizable value of assets 
management believes its estimates  which are reviewed quarterly  to be reasonable and considers its knowledge of the industry  its previous experience in exiting activities and valuations from independent third parties if necessary  in calculation of such estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate  market risks and currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  the company employs internal processes to manage its exposure to interest rate  market risks and currency fluctuations 
the company s objective in managing its interest rate risk is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company is exposed to the impact of currency fluctuations because of its international operations 
as of december   the company had approximately  of variable rate borrowings 
the company estimates that for every fluctuation in general interest rates  assuming debt levels at december   interest expense would vary by  the company s net investment in its foreign subsidiaries  including intercompany balances  at december  was approximately  and accordingly  fluctuations in foreign currency do not have a material impact on the company s financial position 
the company revenues and profitability are related to general levels of economic activity and employment in the united states and the united kingdom 
as a result  any significant economic downturn or recession in one or both of those countries could harm our business and financial condition 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are derived from fortune level companies and their international equivalents  which historically have adjusted expenditures for external training during economic downturns 
if the economies in which these companies operate weaken in any future period  these companies may not increase or may reduce their expenditures on external training  which could adversely affect the company s business and financial condition
