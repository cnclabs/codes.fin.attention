the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview in  the company s revenues were derived from three primary sources online tuition revenues  development revenues  and other service revenues  online tuition revenues are generated primarily from online tuition derived from corporate  government  and higher education customers 
development revenues consist primarily of fees paid to the company for creating and developing new online courseware and web enabling existing courseware 
other service revenues consist primarily of monthly fees generated by the maintenance of the cybis courseware under contract with the us army 
during  the company changed its pricing model from a platform license fee for hosting services to an asp service fees and subscription model based on course usage commitments 
this pricing structure provides a lower cost of entry and generates a recurring revenue stream for vcampus 
while prior to licensing and support revenues have represented a substantial majority of the company s revenues  online related revenues currently comprise the vast majority of the company s total revenues and the company believes that online related revenues will continue to be the primary source of its revenues in the future 
on june   the company s board of directors approved a one for ten reverse stock split of the company s common stock 
the reverse stock split became effective as of the opening of trading on july  stockholders equity has been restated to give retroactive recognition to the reverse stock split for all periods presented by reclassifying the excess par value resulting from the reduced number of shares from common stock to paid in capital 
all references to common share and per share amounts for all periods presented have been retroactively restated to reflect the stock split 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the company s accounting policies which are significantly affected by management s estimates and assumptions are as follows revenue recognition the company derives its revenues from the following sources online tuition revenues  other service revenues and development and other revenues 
revenue is recognized in accordance with either sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended  or statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
both sab and sop generally require that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain sales  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
development and other revenues earned under courseware conversion contracts are recognized based on the ratio that total costs incurred to date bear to the total estimated costs of the contract 
management s estimates of total costs to complete contracts may be revised in future periods resulting in adjustments to revenue and profit recognized in the period the revisions are made 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of those customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
goodwill and other identifiable intangibles management assesses the recoverability of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when management determines that the carrying value of goodwill or other identifiable intangibles is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value can be estimated using a number of techniques including quoted market prices  valuations by third parties and discounted cash flow analysis 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  the company ceased amortizing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles on january  in lieu of amortization  these assets are subject to an annual impairment review 
the company may determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles have been impaired  resulting in an impairment charge in the period the review is completed 
contingencies we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of potential loss  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability  if any  that could result from an unfavorable outcome of these proceedings 
accordingly  no amount has been accrued as of december  for these matters in the consolidated financial statements 
the outcome of these proceeding may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  or the effectiveness of our settlement or litigation strategies  related to these proceedings
