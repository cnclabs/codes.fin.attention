asset liability management the company s earnings depend primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is affected by net interest spread 
changes in net interest spread interest rate risk are influenced to a significant degree by the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  customer options  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for implementing the interest rate risk policies designed to manage its interest rate risk exposure 
the board of directors approves acceptable interest rate risk levels designed to provide sufficient net interest income and net present value of shareholders equity npv assuming specified changes in interest rates 
npv is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities 
one measure of the company s exposure to interest rate risk is shown in the following table which sets forth the repricing frequency of its major assets and liabilities as of march  repricing frequencies of assets are based upon contractual maturities  repricing opportunities  scheduled principal payments and estimated prepayments 
repricing of liabilities are based upon the contractual maturities  estimated decay rates for core deposits  and the earliest repricing opportunity for variable and floating rate instruments 
the company also had million of putable fhlb advances on the balance sheet as of march  that are assumed to reprice at maturity 
the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used  or if actual experience differed from that assumed 
march  months or less more than months to months more than months to months more than months to years more than years to years more than years total in thousands interest earning assets cash  investment securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and fhlb stock loans and mortgage backed securities mortgage backed securities loans receivable  net total loans and mortgage backed securities total interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities fixed maturity deposits core deposits total deposits borrowings total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing liabilities equity total liabilities and stockholders equity interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities based upon contractual maturities  repricing date and forecasted principal payments assuming normal amortization and  where applicable prepayments 
projected constant prepayment rates cpr range from to based on product type and weighted average coupon rate 
assumes of core deposits are subject to repricing in year one 
putable borrowings are presented based upon their contractual maturity date 
the company s one year gap at march   was ie  more interest bearing liabilities re price within one year than interest earning assets  this compares with at march  the company s one year gap has become less negative less liability sensitive due  in part  to the continued high level of loan  mbs and cmo prepayments 
the reduced liability sensitivity was also impacted by the greater percentage of assets comprised by the four cs which typically have shorter durations and more frequent rate resets 
if cpr speeds were to slow by ie from the to used in the accompanying gap table to to  the march  cumulative one year gap would decrease from to a level which would be comparable to the one year cumulative gap at march  a gap table is limited to measuring timing risk and does not reflect the impact of customer options or basis risk the risk that various indices to which the company s assets and liabilities are tied eg prime and cofi will not move with equal speed and magnitude when the general level of interest rates moves either up or down 
to better measure the company s exposure to these and other components of interest rate risk  management relies on an internally maintained  externally supported asset liability simulation model 
the company forecasts its net interest income for the next twelve months  and its npv  assuming there are no changes in interest rates or the balance sheet structure from the current period end 
once this base case has been established  the company subjects its balance sheet to instantaneous and sustained rate changes to the treasury yield curve 
prepayment speeds and the responsiveness of the various indices are estimated for each rate change level 
the model then re forecasts net interest income and npv 
the table below indicates the results of the company s internal modeling of its balance sheet as of march  and the internal calculation of the company s sensitivity to interest rate changes would vary substantially if different assumptions were used  or if the company s or its customers responses to changes in interest rates resulted in changes in the structure of the company s balance sheet 
march  march  percentage change change in interest rates in basis points net interest income net portfolio value net interest income net portfolio value this percentage change represents the impact to net interest income for a one year period assuming the company does not change the structure of its balance sheet 
this percentage change represents the npv of the company assuming no changes to the structure of its balance sheet 
a basis point shock was not run as of march  or due to the low level of current interest rates 
the results from the asset liability model indicate net interest income was more sensitive to rate movements as of march  than it was at march  the increase in potential volatility of net interest income between march  and  can be attributed to several factors including a shortening of asset durations resulting from higher levels of loan  mbs and cmo prepayments  and the increase in the proportion of the asset base comprised by the four cs 
the four c products are generally of shorter duration and are tied to indices eg prime which exhibit greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates than do traditional mortgage loans 
additionally  an increasing proportion of the mortgage loans currently on the company s balance sheet are hybrid arms which have exhibited a higher level of prepayment activity around the first payment reset than traditional arm loans 
the increase in potential volatility of net interest income from changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prepayment activity is partially offset by an expected reduction in net interest income volatility arising from an increase in the proportion of the deposit portfolio comprised by core deposits 
in modeling net interest income  core deposits are assumed to exhibit lower sensitivity to changes in rates than certificates of deposit cds 
this assumption is supported by empirical data developed from historical analysis of the company s deposit portfolio 
as rates have declined  interest sensitive depositors have been able to obtain higher rates and greater liquidity on certain core deposit products than are available on shorter term cds 
the company believes that a portion of these core deposits will move back into cds in response to an increase in rates 
as a result  the company has assumed that core deposits will exhibit greater sensitivity to changes in rates than they have exhibited historically 
nevertheless  the projected sensitivity of core deposits remains below that expected from cds 
this lower sensitivity to changes in interest rates exhibited by core deposits is of value to the company by providing greater stability to funding costs 
this value is referred to as a deposit intangible and while it is not recognized on the company s financial statements  it is included in the calculation of npv 
the low level of npv sensitivity to interest rate changes of or basis points at march   reflects the fact that the anticipated change in the value of the company s deposit intangible and the anticipated change in market value of the company s assets are expected to approximately offset each other when rates move by or basis points 
when rates rise by basis points  the increase in the value of the deposit intangible is anticipated to be less than the decrease in the market value of the company s assets causing npv to decrease 
among the factors contributing to the greater reduction in asset market value and npv at a basis point rate shock is the duration extension that occurs when rates rise and the incentive for borrowers to refinance is reduced 
for any given change in interest rates  asset market value volatility increases with extension in duration 
therefore  this duration extension accentuates the reduction in the market value of loans  mbs and cmo when rates rise  resulting in a corresponding reduction in post rate shock npv 
additionally  as rates increase more significantly  the likelihood of core deposit customers demanding higher rates and or moving into higher cost cds increases  reducing the value of the deposit intangible 
the value of the deposit intangible moves inversely although not necessarily proportionally with the sensitivity of deposits depositors to movements in interest rates 
as noted above  in response to observed customer behavior with respect to core deposits and cds  between march  and  the company revised its deposit intangible downward in calculating npv 
this downward revision contributed to the reductions in post shock npv for the upward rate shocks between march  and contributing to the generally lower level of npv volatility at march  compared to march  was the shortening of asset durations arising from higher prepayment activity caused by the lower interest rate environment 
the ots produces an analysis of the bank s interest rate risk using its own model  based upon data submitted on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports 
the results of the ots model may vary from the bank s internal model primarily due to differences in assumptions utilized in the two models 
these differences include market rates  prepayment rates  and deposit decay rates 
as of march  the bank s sensitivity measure percentage change in npv  as calculated by the ots  was a negative assuming a downward shock of basis points 
at march   the bank s ots calculated sensitivity measure was a negative 
the ots does not model the volatility of net interest income to changes in interest rates

net interest income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase in net interest income was attributable to an basis point expansion in net interest spread from for fiscal to for fiscal coupled with a million increase in average interest earning assets from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal the provision for credit losses was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal interest income interest income decreased million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal due to a basis point decrease in average yield on interest earning assets from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in average yield on interest earning assets was caused by the lower interest rate environment during fiscal compared to fiscal average yield on loans receivable  net decreased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal approximately billion or percent of the company s loans are adjustable rate in nature 
this includes million or percent of the portfolio that is in hybrid arms 
given the repricing profile of the loan portfolio  its yield will be directionally consistent with changes in the general level of interest rates 
the dramatically lower interest rate environment during fiscal also contributed to a significant increase in the turnover of the loan portfolio 
this turnover created an additional downward bias to the yield on the loan portfolio as older  higher yielding loans were replaced by loans originated or purchased at lower market rates 
loan principal repayments increased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal loan originations increased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal loan purchases were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal continued emphasis on the four cs mitigated some of the interest rate environment driven downward movement in the loan portfolio yield 
the four cs increased million during fiscal from billion or percent of loans receivable  net at march  to billion or percent of loans receivable  net at march  originations of the four cs totaled billion or percent of total originations for fiscal compared to billion or percent of total originations for fiscal the very slight decrease in the percentage of total originations comprised by the four cs reflects a significant increase in turnover in the one to four family residential mortgage portfolio rather than any reduction in the company s emphasis on the four cs 
average yield on securities decreased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in average yield on securities was attributable primarily to the decrease in the general level of interest rates 
the one year cmt index to which of the company s march  securities portfolio is tied averaged during fiscal compared to during fiscal three month libor  to which of the company s march  securities portfolio is tied averaged during fiscal compared to during fiscal prime  to which of the company s march  securities portfolio is tied  averaged during fiscal compared to during fiscal paydowns on the company s cmo portfolio during fiscal totaled million percent of the march  balance compared to million percent of the march  balance during fiscal premium amortization associated with these paydowns was million for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this premium amortization reduced average yield on securities  and average yield on interest earning assets for fiscal by and five basis points respectively  compared to four and one basis point  respectively  for fiscal at march   total unamortized premium on cmo was  and total unamortized premium on the entire securities portfolio was million 
the average balance of loans receivable  net increased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal and the aggregate average balance of securities decreased million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal for the past several years  the company s strategy has emphasized growth in loans and deposits with a corresponding de emphasis on wholesale leverage securities funded with fhlb advances and other borrowings 
this strategy was undertaken in connection with the company s focus on enhancing its net interest spread and earnings stream through asset and liability bases comprised to a greater extent by the four cs and core deposits  respectively 
strong four cs origination volumes have provided an investment alternative for the company which is preferable to securities  and is consistent with its long term strategic objectives 
the proportion of total average interest earning assets comprised by loans receivable increased from percent for fiscal to percent for fiscal the company s current strategy is to attempt to maintain loans receivable  net at approximately percent of total interest earning assets 
interest expense interest expense decreased million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the decrease was attributable to a basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities from for fiscal to for fiscal average cost of deposits decreased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal average cost of cds decreased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal and average cost of core deposits decreased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal contributing to the decrease in average cost of deposits was an increase in the proportion of the portfolio comprised by core deposits 
the average balance of core deposits grew by million from million or percent of average total deposits for fiscal to billion or percent of average total deposits for fiscal at march   core deposits totaled billion or percent of total deposits compared to billion or percent of total deposits one year earlier 
average cost of fhlb advances and other borrowings decreased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal average interest bearing liabilities increased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal the average balance of total deposits increased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal and the average balance of fhlb advances and other borrowings decreased million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal provision for loan losses provision for loan losses was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal non accrual loans were million or of gross loans receivable at march  compared to million or of gross loans receivable at march  the allowance for loan losses decreased from million or of gross loans receivable at march  to million or of gross loans receivable at march  the decrease in the allowance for loan losses was due principally to the charge off of million of a million commercial business loan 
total charge offs for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  consideration is given to levels and trends in the following factors the volume and composition of non accrual loans  the volume  severity and composition of classified assets  and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio by type and by collateral 
each of these factors is discussed more fully below 
between march  and non accrual loans increased by million 
the million of non accrual loans at march  is comprised of million of loans secured by one to four family residential mortgages and million of four cs loans 
the composition of these balances is discussed under lending activities non accrual and past due loans 
total classified assets decreased from million at march  to million at march  the march   balance included a loan in the amount of million to a business equipment leasing company 
during fiscal  this loan was upgraded to special mention and removed from classified assets 
total classified assets at march  and also included loans on the castaic project aggregating million and million  respectively 
between march  and  the disbursed balance of the four cs increased by million 
this increased the proportion of loans receivable  net comprised by the four cs from percent to percent 
it also contributed to an increase in the company s average loan size from  at march   to  at march  for a discussion of the larger credits under each loan type  see lending activities 
while the level of non accrual loans increased between march  and  the allowance for loan losses was maintained at its current level based upon the following the decrease in the level of classified assets  and a reduction in the probable loss exposure on certain segments of the loan portfolio 
see lending activities allowance for loan losses 
non interest income non interest income increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal deposit and related fees increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in deposit and related fees reflects the additional fee opportunities associated with the growth in core deposits 
trust fees were million for both fiscal and assets under management or custody were million at march  compared to million at march  loan and servicing fees increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal due principally to the higher volume of loan payoff activity noted earlier 
included in loan and servicing fees for fiscal and is  and  of expense associated with amortization  and  respectively and impairment  and  respectively of originated mortgage servicing rights msr 
at march   the company s msr asset is  the net loss from trading activity was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increase in net loss from trading activities between fiscal and was due to the direction and magnitude of changes in the equity markets 
during fiscal  the company sold million of available for sale securities  generating a net gain of million compared to a net gain of  from the sale of million of available for sale securities during fiscal the securities sold during fiscal were principally higher coupon mbs that had been experiencing or were expected to experience increased levels of prepayment 
the origination of loans for sale is not an area of primary focus for the company 
however  during fiscal  the company sold fixed rate loans totaling million  generating a net gain of  compared to sales of million at a net gain of  during fiscal non interest expense non interest expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal general and administrative expense increased from million or of average assets for fiscal to million or of average assets for fiscal compensation and benefits accounted for million  or  of the increase in general and administrative expense 
a portion of the increase in compensation and benefits expense from million for fiscal to million for fiscal was attributable to the hiring of experienced personnel to generate and support the higher volumes of four cs and core deposits 
the increase in compensation and benefits also reflects the bank s opening of two new full service retail branches during fiscal  and the formation and staffing of glencrest investment advisors 
included in compensation and benefits expense for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  are non cash charges of million and million associated with the bank s esop and incentive plan 
the stock awarded under the incentive plan vested over a five year period ended october accordingly  the non cash charge to expense associated with the incentive plan decreased from million for fiscal to zero for fiscal the allocation of shares under the bank s esop will continue in generally equal installments through fiscal the amount charged to expense under the esop moves upward or downward with changes in the market price of the company s common stock 
esop expense for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the deterioration in the efficiency ratio from for fiscal to for fiscal reflects the temporary lag between incurring the costs of building infrastructure and bringing on the revenues associated with the increases in loan and deposit volumes 
the constrained growth in net interest income caused by the lower interest rate environment also contributed to the deterioration in the efficiency ratio 
contributing to the increase in compensation and benefits expense was a decrease in pension income expense from  for fiscal to  for fiscal applicable to the bank s frozen defined benefit pension plan the plan 
the decrease in pension income reflects a reduction in the value of plan assets coupled with an increase in the projected plan benefit obligation arising from a reduction in the discount rate used to value the obligation 
as of march   the market value of plan assets was million  compared to million at march  as of march   the projected plan benefit obligation was million compared to million at march  as a result  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of march  and are net minimum pension liabilities of million and million  respectively  arising from the shortfalls between plan assets and liabilities 
during fiscal  the company began moving a substantial portion of plan assets into fixed income investments under an investment immunization program 
this strategy is expected to significantly reduce the future earnings and asset liability value mismatch volatility arising from the plan 
as of march   approximately of plan assets were in fixed income investments whose cash flows are projected to closely match the corresponding benefit obligation payments 
the increase in marketing and professional services expense from million for fiscal to million for fiscal was attributable to the marketing efforts associated with the two new branch openings as well as an increase in expenditures associated with increased marketing efforts directed toward the hispanic segments of the communities served by the bank 
income taxes income taxes were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal comparison of financial condition at march  and march  total assets increased million from billion at march  to billion at march  reflecting the company s strategy of increasing the loan orientation of its asset base  loans receivable  net increased million from billion at march  to billion at march   while securities decreased million from million at march  to million at march  cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million at march  to million at march  the cash balance at march  was high as a result of very strong deposit inflows during the quarter ended march   that materialized faster than the funds could be optimally deployed to fund loans and repay maturing borrowings all of which were subject to prepayment penalties 
total liabilities increased million from billion at march  to billion at march  total deposits increased million from billion at march  to billion at march  the bank s emphasis on growing the lower cost  more stable segments of its deposit portfolio is reflected in a million increase in core deposits from billion or percent of total deposits at march  to billion or percent of total deposits at march  fhlb advances and other borrowings decreased million from million at march  to million at march  total stockholders equity decreased million from million at march  to million at march  the million decrease is comprised principally of a million decrease in retained earnings  substantially restricted and a million decrease in additional paid in capital  partially offset by a million decrease in unearned stock based compensation and a million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the million decrease in retained earnings  substantially restricted reflects net earnings of million for fiscal offset by million attributable to the amount paid to repurchase  shares of common stock at prices in excess of the per share original issuance price of the stock 
the  shares of common stock were repurchased at a weighted average price of per share  and million of cash dividends declared during fiscal cash dividends of per share were declared and paid during the first two quarters of fiscal the cash dividend was increased to per share effective with the december dividend 
the company s increased emphasis on the four cs coupled with a corresponding de emphasis on wholesale leverage has resulted in a relatively low rate of growth in the total asset base over the past several years as growth in loans has been offset to a degree by decreases in securities 
as a result  the company s rate of capital formation through retention of earnings has exceeded the level required to support the growth in the total asset base 
the company has utilized share repurchases as a means of deploying some of this excess capital and enhancing earnings per share and return on average equity 
the million decrease in additional paid in capital was attributable to an million reduction representing the removal from additional paid in capital of the march original purchase price of the shares that were repurchased during fiscal  a million increase representing the amounts paid by directors and officers to exercise stock options granted to them under the and incentive plans along with the tax benefit to the company arising therefrom  and a million increase attributable to amortization of shares under the incentive plan 
during fiscal options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock were exercised at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
the million decrease in unearned stock based compensation was attributable to amortization under the company s esop 
the million decrease in other comprehensive loss was comprised principally of a million change in the unrealized gain loss  net of tax on the company s portfolio of securities available for sale from million at march  to  at march  a million change in the minimum pension liability adjustment was offset by a million tax benefit associated therewith 
comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and march general net earnings rose million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the improvement in operating results between fiscal and was attributable principally to a million increase in net interest income from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in net interest income reflects a basis point expansion in net interest spread from for fiscal to for fiscal total non interest income increased million or percent and total non interest expense increased million or percent between fiscal and interest income interest income decreased million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal attributable principally to a basis point decrease in average yield on interest earning assets from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in average yield on interest earning assets was caused by the lower interest rate environment during fiscal compared to fiscal average interest earning assets remained relatively stable at billion for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal average yield on loans receivable  net decreased basis points from for fiscal to for fiscal  reflecting the adjustable rate nature of the company s loan portfolio 
the dramatically lower interest rate environment during fiscal also contributed to a significant increase in the turnover of the loan portfolio 
this turnover created an additional downward bias to the yield on the loan portfolio as older  higher yielding loans were replaced by originated or purchased loans at lower market rates 
loan principal repayments increased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal loan originations increased million from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal in response to the higher level of loan repayments  loan purchases were increased from million during fiscal to million for fiscal continued emphasis on the four cs mitigated some of the interest rate environment driven downward movement in the loan portfolio yield 
the four cs increased million during fiscal to million or percent of loans receivable  net at march  from million or percent of loans receivable  net at march  originations of the four cs totaled billion or percent of total originations for fiscal compared to million or percent of total originations for fiscal the decrease in the percentage of total originations comprised by the four cs reflects the significant increase in turnover in the single family residential mortgage portfolio rather than any reduction in the company s emphasis on the four cs

during fiscal  this million loan was determined to be impaired and an allowance for loss was established for the full amount of the loan 
during fiscal  this loan was charged off  reducing total non accrual loans and the total allowance for loan losses by million 
as a result  the allowance for loan losses was little changed between march  million and march  million 
growth in the loan portfolio reduced the ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans receivable from at march  to at march  had the million castaic loan been charged off at march   it would have reduced the ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans at that time to  a level that would have been very comparable to the march   ratio of

the net loss from trading activity was  for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the reduction in net loss from trading activities between fiscal and was due  in part  to the direction and magnitude of changes in the equity markets

also contributing to the increase in compensation and benefits expense was a decrease in pension income from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the decrease in pension income reflects a significant reduction in the value of plan assets  the majority of which had been invested in equity securities 
as of march   the market value of plan assets was million  compared to million at march  as of march   the projected plan benefit obligation was million compared to million at march  as a result  included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of march  is million applicable to the march  shortfall between plan assets and liabilities 
the increase in marketing and professional services expense from million for fiscal to million for fiscal was attributable  in part  to an increase in hispanic marketing expenditures and promotional expenditures associated with the bank s opening of its twenty fourth full service branch in la quinta  california in february income taxes income taxes were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal liquidity and capital resources the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the company has the continuing ability to maintain cash flows that are adequate to fund operations and meet other obligations on a timely and cost effective basis 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at march   cash and short term investments totaled million 
effective july  the ots adopted a rule eliminating the statutory liquidity requirement 
in its place  the ots adopted a policy  consistent with that of the other federal banking regulatory agencies  that liquidity be maintained at a level which provides for safe and sound banking practices and financial flexibility 
the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and securities  fhlb advances and other borrowings  and to a lesser extent  proceeds from the sale of loans or securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and security prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
management s strategy is to manage liquidity by investing excess cash flows in higher yielding interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  or paying down fhlb advances and other borrowings  depending on market conditions
