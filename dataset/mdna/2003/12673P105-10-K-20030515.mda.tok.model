back to index introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition  change in financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
the md a is organized as follows nature of business this section provides a general description of our business and our business model 
performance indicators this section discusses several metrics that may be used to assess our financial results and condition 
results of operations this section discusses our results of operations for all three years presented in the consolidated statements of operations 
outlook for fiscal year this section provides forward looking statements about our expected performance for fiscal year based on currently available information 
selected quarterly information this section provides financial information about revenue and net loss on a quarterly basis for the last two fiscal years 
liquidity and capital resources this section provides an analysis of our cash flows  as well as a discussion of our outstanding debt as of march  in addition  this section provides an analysis of the financial capacity available to fund our future commitments  as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements this section discusses commitments that we have that are not accounted for on our balance sheet as of march  contractual obligations and commitments the section provides an analysis of our contractual arrangements  including outstanding debt  as of march  critical accounting policies and business practices this section discusses those accounting policies and business practices that we consider important to our financial results and condition 
generally  these policies and practices require significant judgment and estimates 
in addition  our significant accounting policies  including those considered critical  are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements this section provides an analysis of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
the analysis includes a discussion of when the new pronouncements are effective for us and what the expected impact will be on our financial results and condition 
risk factors this section provides a description of risk factors that could adversely affect our revenue  profitability  and cash flow in the future 
nature of business as described in greater detail in part i of this form k  we license our software products directly to customers as well as to distribution partners  resellers  and vars 
we generate revenues from the following sources license fees licensing our products on a right to use basis  maintenance fees providing customer technical support and product enhancements  and service fees providing professional services such as product implementation  consulting  and education services 
the timing and amount of fees recognized as revenue during a period are determined individually by license agreement  based on its duration and specific terms 
in october  we announced the shift to our existing business model that offers customers greater flexibility to change how they can use and license our software products as their business changes 
this flexibility reduces the customer s risks and up front financial commitment associated with traditional software licensing models 
under our business model  customers can better manage the duration and dollar value of their software licenses 
our business model provides customers with the flexibility to subscribe to software under month to month licenses or fix their costs by committing to longer term agreements 
our business model also permits customers to change their software mix as their business and technology needs change 
this includes the right to receive software in the future within defined product lines for no additional fee 
we believe our business model improves the predictability of our revenue streams  since we recognize license revenue evenly on a monthly basis  or ratably  over the life of the license agreement 
under our prior business model  and as is common practice in the software industry  most of these license fees were recorded up front at the time the license agreement was signed and the software was delivered 
under our business model  the portion of the license revenue that is not recognized currently creates what we refer to as deferred subscription revenue 
this deferred subscription revenue will be recognized as revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the terms of the license agreements 
when recognized  this revenue will be recorded on the subscription revenue line item on our consolidated statements of operations 
if a customer pays for software prior to the recognition of revenue  the amount deferred is reported as a liability titled deferred subscription revenue collected  on our consolidated balance sheets 
otherwise  deferred subscription revenue is reported as a reduction of the accounts receivable the contractual amount due from the customer 

back to index performance indicators the following is a summary of some of the quantitative performance indicators that may be used to assess our financial results and condition for the year ended march  change percent change dollars in millions subscription revenue total revenue subscription revenue as a percent of total revenue new deferred subscription revenue weighted average license agreement duration in years cash from operations net loss as of march  change percent change dollars in millions total debt subscription revenue subscription revenue is the ratable revenue recognized in a period from amounts previously recorded as deferred subscription revenue 
subscription revenue also includes revenue earned from monthly licenses 
the larger the ratio of subscription revenue to total revenue  the more predictable our revenue streams become 
a change in subscription revenue is correlated with a change in deferred subscription revenue  and therefore  since we expect an increase in deferred subscription revenue  we also expect subscription revenue to increase in fiscal year total revenue total revenue is the sum of all revenue line items 
although subscription revenue continues to increase  certain other revenue line items in our consolidated statements of operations are decreasing 
as we noted in our previous filings  these decreases were generally expected 
we expected decreases in the maintenance  financing fees  and professional services line items as described in further detail below 
software fees and other  which largely represents software revenues from our channel and oem business  decreased more than we expected in fiscal year for a more complete description of the reasons why each revenue item increased or decreased  refer to the results of operations section below 
new deferred subscription revenue new deferred subscription revenue represents the total undiscounted incremental value license agreement value of all new software licenses sold in the current period by our direct sales force 
new deferred subscription revenue excludes the value associated with license agreements for maintenance only as well as professional service arrangements 
this new deferred subscription revenue is what we expect to collect from our customers 
this amount is recorded into subscription revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the applicable software license term 
these license agreements represent binding payment commitments from customers over periods generally up to three years 
weighted average license agreement duration in years the weighted average license agreement duration in years represents the sum of the duration of all software licenses executed during a fiscal year  weighted by each individual software license s contract value 
the calculation for fiscal year of years was derived from the following quarterly new deferred subscription revenue amounts recorded and weighted average durations in years  respectively q million  years  q million  years  q million  years  and q million  years 
for fiscal year  the calculation of years was derived from the following quarterly new deferred subscription revenue amounts recorded and weighted average durations in years  respectively q million  years  q million  years  q million  years  and q million  years 
we believe license agreement durations averaging approximately three years  which is lower than the historical duration of our contracts  increase the value the customer receives from our software licenses by giving customers the flexibility to vary their software mix as their needs change 
we also believe this flexibility improves our customer relationships and encourages greater accountability by the company to each of our customers  which in turn may lead to increased future sales opportunities 
cash from operations cash from operations from our consolidated statements of cash flows represents the excess of cash collected from billings to our customers over cash paid for expenses to run our business 
this amount represents what is available to pay for equipment  technology  and other investing activities  to repay debt  pay dividends  buy back stock  or for other financing purposes 
we believe this is an important performance indicator since cash generation over the long term is essential to maintaining a healthy business and providing funds to help fuel growth 
we believe generating consistently strong cash from operations is an indication that we are achieving a high level of customer satisfaction with our products and are appropriately managing our expenses 

back to index net loss under our business model  revenue is deferred and recognized evenly on a monthly basis whereas under the prior business model  license revenue was generally recognized up front 
however  costs continued to be expensed as incurred 
as a result  we have experienced net losses 
as we increase revenue and maintain our cost structure  we anticipate returning to a net profit 
the decrease in net loss from fiscal year to was attributable to  among other things  our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  whereby we no longer amortize goodwill 
goodwill amortization was approximately million in fiscal year total debt total debt includes the current and long term portions of our debt obligations 
we have made a strategic decision to reduce our overall debt level and have achieved a billion reduction during the last two fiscal years 
refer to the discussion of our results of operations and risk factors herein and the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the items discussed in this section 
results of operations the following table presents the percentage of total revenue and the percentage of period over period dollar change for the line items in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended march    and these comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
fiscal year fiscal year percentage of percentage of percentage of percentage of total revenue dollar change total revenue dollar change revenue subscription revenue software fees and other maintenance financing fees professional services total revenue operating expenses amortization of capitalized software costs cost of professional services selling  general and administrative product development and enhancements commission and royalties depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill impairment stock plan total operating expenses loss before other expenses interest expense  net loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net loss note amounts may not add to their respective totals due to rounding 
total revenue total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million from the fiscal year ended march  to billion 
this increase was primarily due to the transition to our business model that began during the third quarter of fiscal year this transition resulted in an increase in subscription revenue from the prior fiscal year  partially offset by a decrease in maintenance and financing fees as described below 
professional services and software fees and other revenue decreased for fiscal year as described below 
in addition  there was a positive impact to revenue of million compared to fiscal year due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
this foreign exchange rate impact was fully offset by the impact of the sale of our interbiz unit in april  which had contributed approximately million of revenue in fiscal year cautious capital spending by our existing and potential customers associated with weak conditions in the overall economy and the it industry adversely impacted bookings of new license agreements and revenue in fiscal year 
back to index total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  decreased billion from the fiscal year ended march   to billion 
this decrease was primarily due to the transition to our business model beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year  which resulted in a decrease in license fees recognized up front compared to the prior year period  partially offset by new subscription revenue 
the period that license agreements were recorded prior to our business model is deemed the prior business model 
in addition  apprehension toward capital spending by our existing and potential customers due to weakened conditions in the overall economy and the technology industry also impacted fiscal year revenue 
during fiscal year  approximately billion was recognized as revenue up front at license agreement signing under our prior business model and was included in the software fees and other line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the total revenue decrease was also attributable to a decline in professional services revenue of million  as described below 
although the transition to our business model and weaker economic conditions contributed to the revenue decrease  quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on such decrease is not readily determinable 
subscription revenue subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million from fiscal year to billion 
subscription revenue represents the ratable portion of revenue recognized on software license agreements entered into under our business model 
many of the licenses recorded between october  when our business model began  and the end of fiscal year  have terms of three years or greater 
therefore  many did not expire during fiscal year  and continue to contribute to subscription revenue on a monthly  ratable basis 
as a result  subscription revenue for fiscal year includes the ratable recognition of bookings recorded in fiscal year  as well as most of the bookings recorded between october and the end of fiscal year this is the main reason for the increase in subscription revenue in fiscal year versus fiscal year during fiscal years and  we added new deferred subscription revenue of billion and billion  respectively 
the approximate duration of license agreements executed under our business model in fiscal year and was a weighted average life of approximately years and years  respectively 
thus  annualized deferred subscription revenue  which represents the total value of all new software license agreements signed during a period divided by the weighted average duration of all such license agreements recorded during the same period  increased approximately million  or  for fiscal year over the prior fiscal year to million 
subscription revenue also increased as a result of how we record maintenance revenue under our business model compared to the prior method 
under our prior business model  maintenance revenue was separately identified and was recorded to the maintenance line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
under our business model  bundled maintenance is not separately identified in our customers license agreements and therefore is included within the subscription revenue line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the increase in subscription revenue is not readily determinable 
subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million from the prior fiscal year to million 
the increase was primarily due to the introduction of our business model that began in the third quarter of fiscal year fiscal year included subscription revenue earned from software license agreements that were completed during the months of fiscal year these license agreements did not contribute to revenue in fiscal year during fiscal years and we added new deferred subscription revenue of billion and billion  respectively 
software fees and other software fees and other primarily consists of royalties and revenue related to distribution and oem partners 
revenue related to distribution partners and oems is sometimes referred to as our indirect or channel revenue 
for the fiscal year ended march   software fees and other decreased million from the fiscal year ended march  to million 
the decrease was primarily due to a difficult economic and competitive environment 
software fees and other decreased during fiscal year by billion from the fiscal year ended march  to million 
during fiscal year  the portion of revenue that we recognized up front at the signing of a new license agreement under our prior business model of approximately billion was recorded to the software fees and other line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we switched to our business model and no longer recorded this revenue up front 
maintenance as expected  maintenance revenue for fiscal years and decreased million and million  respectively  from the respective prior fiscal years to million and million  respectively 
the decrease in maintenance revenue for both years is attributable to additional license agreements signed under our business model where bundled maintenance revenue is now included with license revenue  which is reported in the subscription revenue line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the combined maintenance and license revenue on these types of license agreements is recognized on a monthly basis ratably over the term of the agreement 
the decrease is partially offset by new maintenance revenue earned from customers who elect optional maintenance at the expiration of their non term based license agreements 
the quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the decrease in maintenance revenue is not readily determinable 

back to index financing fees financing fees result from the initial discounting to present value of product sales with extended payment terms under our prior business model  which required up front revenue recognition 
this discount initially reduced the related installment accounts receivable  and was referred to as unamortized discounts 
over the life of the applicable license agreement  the related unamortized discount is amortized and reported as financing fees 
under our business model  additional unamortized discounts are no longer recorded  since we do not account for the present value of product sales as earned revenue when license agreements are signed 
as expected  for fiscal years and  financing fees decreased million and million  respectively  from the prior fiscal years to million and million  respectively 
the decrease for both years is attributable to the discontinuance of offering license agreements under our prior business model 
professional services professional services revenue for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
the decrease was partially attributable to the divestiture of our interbiz unit in april  which generated approximately million of professional services revenue in fiscal year the decrease was also a result of the weak spending environment that affected the it service sector in general  as well as our continued shift in focus to professional services engagements that are focused solely on our software products 
quantification of the impact that these factors had on the decrease in professional services revenue is not readily determinable 
professional services revenue for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million primarily as a result of our shift in focus to professional services engagements that are centered around our products 
the decrease was also attributable to our divestiture in october of sterling s federal systems group fsg  a provider of professional services to governmental agencies  which contributed approximately million to professional services revenue in fiscal year total revenue by geography revenue in the united states represented approximately of overall revenue for fiscal year  as compared to approximately for fiscal year international revenue increased million  or  in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year results in fiscal year included our interbiz operations  which we divested in april those operations contributed approximately million and million of revenue in the prior fiscal year from the united states and international regions  respectively 
the increases in international revenue were primarily attributable to an improvement in our business in europe and asia as well as the million positive impact due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
revenue in the united states represented of overall revenue for fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year consistent with the reasons for the overall decrease in revenue  international revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year price changes did not have a material impact in fiscal years   or amortization of capitalized software costs amortization of capitalized software costs consists of the amortization of both purchased software and capitalized internally generated software development costs 
internally generated capitalized software costs are related to new products and significant enhancements to existing software products that have reached the technological feasibility stage 
amortization of capitalized software costs for fiscal year decreased million from the prior fiscal year to million and for fiscal year  decreased million from fiscal year to million 
we recorded amortization of purchased software products for the fiscal years ended march    and of million  million  and million  respectively 
we recorded amortization of capitalized internally generated software development costs for the fiscal years ended march    and of million  million  and million  respectively 
the total decrease for both years was due primarily to certain purchased software assets becoming fully amortized 
cost of professional services cost of professional services consists primarily of the personnel related costs associated with providing professional services and training to customers 
cost of professional services for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in professional service engagements and related personnel costs 

back to index cost of professional services for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in professional service engagements and related personnel costs  including the divestiture of fsg  which contributed approximately million of such expenses in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative sg a sg a expenses for fiscal year decreased million compared to fiscal year to billion 
the decrease was attributable to our emphasis on overall cost control measures  including a reduction in personnel and personnel related costs 
during fiscal year  we had an average of approximately  employees 
this represents a decrease of approximately  employees from our fiscal year average of  employees  some of which were personnel costs that impacted other line items 
the reduction in headcount consisted of a reduction in workforce of approximately employees in october  approximately employees from the divestiture of certain assets of our interbiz operations in april  and approximately employees from the divestiture of our banking product group in october this reduction was partially offset by headcount additions in the current year primarily due to the opening of a new call center for telemarketing efforts 
our interbiz unit contributed approximately million of sg a expenses in the prior fiscal year  the majority of which were personnel costs 
the decrease in sg a expenses was also attributable to a reduction of the bad debt expense of million  which relates to ongoing operations  and million of bad debt expense that was recorded in fiscal year prior to the divestiture of the interbiz unit in april this reduction reflects a decrease in installment accounts receivable related to the prior business model see the accounts receivable section of critical accounting policies and business practices for additional information 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million capitalized software impairment charge 
this amount was previously recorded as part of the fiscal year total impairment charge of million related to the sale of interbiz 
sg a expenses for fiscal year decreased million compared to fiscal year to billion 
the decrease was largely attributable to our emphasis on overall cost control measures  including a reduction in personnel and personnel related costs  such as reduced travel expenses  in connection with a reduction in our headcount of approximately  employees over the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year  we recorded a charge associated with the bankruptcy of inacom corporation of approximately million 
product development and enhancements product development and enhancement expenditures  also referred to as research and development  for fiscal year decreased million compared to fiscal year to million 
as a percentage of operating expenses  net research and development expenditures increased to approximately in the current fiscal year  compared to approximately in the prior fiscal year  excluding the amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce from fiscal year operating expenses 
we continued to focus on product development and enhancements  emerging technologies such as linux  wireless and web services  and a broadening of our enterprise product offerings 
product development and enhancement expenditures for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
the decrease was a result of general cost containment  primarily related to personnel costs 
we continued our focus on product development and enhancements  with an emphasis on adapting and enhancing products within our focus areas  particularly for the distributed processing and ibm s z os environments  as well as a broadening of our enterprise product offerings 
commissions and royalties commissions and royalties for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
this decrease was due primarily to an million reduction in royalties paid to third parties resulting from continued internal product development and enhancements 
this decrease was also due to the reduction in sales and related commission expense associated with the divestiture of certain assets of our interbiz unit 
that unit contributed approximately million of such expenses in fiscal year commissions and royalties for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
commissions and royalties expense as a percentage of revenue increased due to the lower revenue achievement associated with our transition to our business model without an associated change in the overall sales compensation 
the decrease in commissions and royalties expense was principally the result of a decline in license agreement bookings associated with the weaker economic environment for it spending 
depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
the decrease was primarily a result of adopting sfas no 
in april with sfas no 
 a non amortization fair value based impairment approach is used to account for goodwill and certain intangible assets see note to the consolidated financial statements 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 assembled workforce no longer met the definition of an identifiable intangible asset and  therefore  must be reclassified to goodwill and follow the non amortization impairment approach 
as a result  the assembled workforce net balance of million as of march  was reclassified to goodwill 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we amortized million and million of goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible asset  respectively  during fiscal year on a per share basis  we recorded 
and 
of goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible asset amortization  respectively  during fiscal year 
back to index depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year to million 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was a result of certain intangible assets from past acquisitions becoming fully amortized 
goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we performed our annual goodwill impairment review under sfas no 
and recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to our professional services organization 
the impairment is attributable to our lower than expected results and our projected performance 
see the critical accounting policies and business practices section for additional information 
under the provisions of sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the charge related to the sale of certain assets  under the name interbiz  to ssa in april the million consisted of a million goodwill impairment charge recorded to the goodwill impairment line item on the consolidated statements of operations and a million capitalized software impairment charge recorded to the sg a line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
stock plan in fiscal year  we recorded a gain of million related to the settlement of the key employee stock ownership plan stock plan litigation 
under the terms of the settlement  the stock plan participants returned million shares of ca stock to the company 
net interest expense net interest expense for fiscal year decreased million as compared to fiscal year to million 
of the change  million was due to the decrease in average debt outstanding  million was due to the decrease in the average variable interest rate  and million was the result of gains from the early retirement of portions of our outstanding debt 
see liquidity and capital resources and new accounting pronouncements regarding sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections for additional information 
net interest expense for fiscal year decreased million as compared to fiscal year to million 
of the change  million was due to the decrease in average debt outstanding and million was due to the decrease in the average variable interest rate 
operating margins for fiscal year  our pretax loss was million as compared to a pretax loss of billion in fiscal year the decrease in pretax loss was primarily related to an increase in revenue of million  a reduction in expenses of million  or  for fiscal year  excluding the amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce in fiscal year  and the elimination of amortization of goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible asset as of april   in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
 which totaled million in fiscal year income tax benefit our consolidated effective tax rate benefit was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increased effective tax rate reflects the goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible assets that were amortized for financial statement purposes but not for tax purposes prior to fiscal year  net of the fiscal year goodwill impairment charge 
beginning with adoption of sfas no 
 these assets are no longer amortized for either financial statement or tax purposes 
our effective tax rate benefit is below the statutory rate in fiscal year primarily due to the non tax deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge 
our effective tax rate benefit is below the statutory rate in fiscal year primarily due to the non tax deductibility of goodwill amortization 
outlook for fiscal year this outlook for fiscal year contains certain forward looking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs and assumptions made by management  as well as information currently available to management 
should business conditions change or should our assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those described below 
we do not intend to update these projections 

back to index the outlook for the overall economy and the it environment  complicated by recent international conflicts  continues to be difficult to predict 
the outlook for our fiscal year results comes from the assumption that there will be limited to modest improvement in the current economic and it environments 
we also believe that customers will continue to be cautious with their technology purchases 
our preliminary outlook for fiscal year is to generate revenue in the range of billion to billion  an increase of between to  and loss per share in the range of 
to 
we expect that subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue  as well as annualized deferred subscription revenue  should continue to increase during fiscal year for the same reasons as described in results of operations for the fiscal year increase  our weighted average license agreement duration will continue to be approximately years  the level of business from distribution and oem partners for fiscal year should remain steady or increase slightly from that of fiscal year as new products are brought to market and organizational improvements initiated during the second half of fiscal year are realized  maintenance revenue as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations should continue to decrease as deferred maintenance revenue previously recorded under our prior business model is amortized over the term of the license agreement 
under our business model  maintenance revenue is now included with license revenue and  therefore  will be recorded on the subscription revenue line item 
we expect this decrease to be partially offset by new revenue earned from customers who elect optional maintenance at the expiration of their non term based license agreements  financing fees will continue to decrease  the level of professional service engagements for fiscal year should be similar to that of fiscal year the formation of the cats organization in april should result in increased efficiency in our services organization  the cost control measures implemented to date should enable us to report improved fiscal year sg a costs  both in total and as a percentage of total revenue compared with those reported in fiscal year  product development and enhancement expenditures should remain steady and continue to constitute a significant portion of total operating expenses in fiscal year  since such investment is essential to maintaining and improving our competitive position  our debt level should decrease by approximately million in fiscal year  and the effective tax rate benefit for fiscal year should be approximately 
the increase in the tax rate results from the impact of the non deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in fiscal year we currently maintain stock option plans and restricted stock award plans for fiscal year and all prior years 
we accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation expense for stock options was reported in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended march    and  as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to or above the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective april   we have adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
we will recognize compensation expense related to all option awards granted after march  in the consolidated statements of operations 
we will continue to disclose the effect of option awards granted prior to march  on a pro forma basis in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
beginning in fiscal year  we adopted the fair value based method of recording stock options outlined in sfas no 
as a result of evolving practice  stock options will be considered employee compensation expense  and therefore it is appropriate that the computed value will be recorded in our financial results 
we have historically used the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of each option grant 
the black scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected lives  and risk free interest rates 
these assumptions reflect our best estimates  but these items involve uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control 
the following table sets forth the various estimated effects on future earnings loss per share as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
using the fair market value of our stock as of march  base price 
for purposes of this table  we have assumed million option shares are awarded in the last month of each fiscal year  which is consistent with fiscal year  but may not be indicative of future option grants approved by the board of directors 
we have assumed all other variables to be the same as those used for fiscal year  as detailed in note of the consolidated financial statements 

back to index assumed exercise price year ended march  of stock option award base price below base price above base price above base price as a result of the assumption of issuing stock options in the last month of the fiscal year  the compensation expense is expected to be negligible 
the above table provides sensitivity analysis related to the granting of stock options and the associated expense incurred over the vesting period of the option 
the assumptions used may vary significantly  which can result in a material change to the amounts presented above

net debt repayments approximated million during fiscal year we used cash on hand and cash from operations to repay more than billion in outstanding debt  which was offset by the issuance of million of new  unsecured convertible senior notes 
additionally  we repurchased approximately million in treasury stock in fiscal year cash generated from operations for fiscal year was billion  an increase of million from the prior year s cash from operations of billion 
cash from operations was favorably impacted this fiscal year compared with the prior fiscal year by savings in operating costs 
as of march  and  our debt arrangements consisted of the following maximum outstanding maximum outstanding debt arrangements available balance available balance in millions revolver  term loan revolver commercial paper  senior notes due april senior notes due april senior notes due april convertible senior notes due march senior notes due april convertible senior notes due december international line of credit other total   
back to index revolver on december   we entered into a new  unsecured  bank revolving credit facility the revolver of million 
during the quarter ending march   the revolver was increased to million  and then in april it was further increased to a total capacity of million 
the revolver expires january   and no amount was drawn as of march  the interest rates on the revolver are determined based on a ratings grid  which applies a margin to the prevailing london interbank offered rate libor 
we capitalized the initial transaction fees associated with the revolver  which totaled approximately million 
we are amortizing these fees over the term of the revolver in the interest expense  net line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
revolver and term loan effective december   the amount that may be outstanding at any time under the existing billion  four year revolving credit facility the revolver  which expires on may   was reduced to million 
as of march   million was drawn under the revolver 
the million outstanding balance as of march   on the then existing billion four year term loan the term loan  was repaid in full during fiscal year on december  we repaid million of the balance of the term loan in advance of the first quarter of fiscal year due date 
the interest rates on the revolver and the term loan are determined based on a ratings grid  which applies a margin to the prevailing libor 
we do not intend to renew the revolver upon its expiration based upon our current view that the new  unsecured revolver of million  which was undrawn as of march   should be sufficient to meet future needs 
commercial paper during fiscal year  we reduced our commercial paper cp program from billion to million 
as of march   there were no borrowings outstanding under the cp program 
we expect any future outstanding borrowings under the cp program will be supported by cash and marketable securities on hand and undrawn amounts available under the revolver 
convertible senior notes we also utilize other financial markets in order to maintain our broad sources of liquidity 
in fiscal year  we issued million of unsecured convertible senior notes notes  due december   in a transaction pursuant to rule a of the securities act of rule a 
the notes are senior unsecured indebtedness and rank equally with all existing senior unsecured indebtedness 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we also entered into call spread repurchase option transactions notes call spread 
the entire notes call spread purchase price of million was charged to stockholders equity 
under the terms of the notes call spread  we have the option to receive i outstanding shares equivalent to the number of shares that may be issued if all of the notes are converted into shares million shares upon payment of an exercise price of per share aggregate of million  or ii a net cash settlement  net share settlement or a combination  whereby we will receive cash or shares equal to the increase in the market value of the million shares from the aggregate value at the exercise price aggregate of million  subject to the upper limit of discussed below 
the notes call spread is designed to partially mitigate the potential dilution from conversion of the notes  depending upon the market price of our common stock at such time 
the notes call spread can be exercised during december at an exercise price of per share 
to limit the cost of the notes call spread  an upper limit of per share has been set such that if the price of the common stock is above that limit at the time of exercise  the number of shares eligible to be purchased will be proportionately reduced based on the amount the common share price exceeds at the time of exercise 
we capitalized the initial transaction fees associated with the notes  which totaled approximately million 
these fees are being amortized over the period through maturity of the notes in the interest expense  net line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
convertible senior notes in fiscal year  we issued million of unsecured convertible senior notes notes  due march   in a transaction pursuant to rule a 
the notes are senior unsecured indebtedness and rank equally with all existing senior unsecured indebtedness 
the company capitalized the initial transaction fees associated with the notes  which totaled approximately million

concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we entered into call spread repurchase option transactions notes call spread 
the option purchase price of the notes call spread was million 
the entire purchase price of million was charged to stockholders equity 
under the terms of the notes call spread  we have the option to purchase outstanding shares equivalent to the number of shares that may be issued if all the notes are converted into shares million shares  thereby mitigating dilution to stockholders 
the notes call spreads are designed to partially mitigate the potential dilution from conversion of the notes  depending upon the market price of our common stock at such time

to limit the cost of the notes call spread  an upper limit of per share has been set such that if the price of the common stock is above that limit at the time of exercise  the number of shares eligible to be purchased will be proportionately reduced based on the amount the common share price exceeds at the time of exercise 

back to index fiscal year senior notes in fiscal year  we issued billion of unsecured senior notes in a transaction pursuant to rule a 
amounts borrowed  rates  and maturities for each issue were million at due april   million at due april   and million at due april  during fiscal year  we repurchased million of the senior notes due april  at a discount 
the repurchases resulted in a total gain of approximately million 
the gain was included in the interest expense  net line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
as of march   million  million and million of our  and senior notes  respectively  remained outstanding 
the balance of the senior notes was fully repaid in april fiscal year senior notes in fiscal year  million of unsecured senior notes were issued in a private transaction pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of the senior notes call for annual repayment of million each april  commencing in april with final payment in april as of march   million was outstanding under the senior notes 
the balance of the senior notes was fully repaid in april international line of credit an unsecured and uncommitted multi currency line of credit is available to meet short term working capital needs for subsidiaries operating outside the united states 
this line totals million  and no amount was drawn under this credit line as of march  other matters we pre fund contributions to our broad based  employee defined contribution retirement plan annually each march 
pre funded contributions totaled million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
subsequent to march   we received million in proceeds related to the sale of fixed assets 
since the carrying value of the fixed assets was zero  the entire amount will result in a gain to be recorded in the quarter ended june  debt ratings for our senior unsecured notes and our bank credit facilities are bbb and baa from standard poor s and moody s investors service  respectively 
our cp program is rated a from standard poor s and p from moody s 
peak borrowings under all debt facilities during the fiscal year totaled approximately billion  with a weighted average interest rate of 
as of march   the cumulative number of shares purchased under our various open market common stock repurchase programs since fiscal year was million  including million shares purchased in fiscal year the remaining number of shares authorized for repurchase is approximately million 
capital resource requirements as of march  consisted of lease obligations for office space  equipment  mortgage or loan obligations  and amounts due as a result of product and company acquisitions 
it is expected that existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  the availability of borrowings under existing and renewable credit lines  and cash expected to be provided from operations will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements 
we expect our long standing history of providing extended payment terms to our customers to continue 
off balance sheet arrangements we have commitments to invest approximately million in connection with joint venture agreements 
in prior fiscal years  we sold individual accounts receivable under the prior business model to an external third party subject to certain recourse provisions 
the amounts subject to recourse approximated million and million as of march  and  respectively 
other than the commitments and indemnification described above  we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and  accordingly  off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities are limited 

back to index contractual obligations and commitments we have commitments under certain contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services 
these contractual arrangements secure the rights to various assets and services to be used in the future in the normal course of business 
for example  we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 
in accordance with current accounting rules  the future rights and related obligations pertaining to such contractual arrangements are not reported as assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we expect to fund these contractual arrangements with cash generated from operations in the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at march   and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
in addition  the table summarizes the timing of principal payments on noncurrent debt as reported on our consolidated balance sheet as of march  payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in millions noncurrent debt inclusive of interest noncurrent operating leases noncurrent purchase obligations total the contractual obligations for noncurrent operating leases include sublease income totaling million  expected to be received in the following periods million less than year  million years  million years  and million after years 
as of march   we have no material capital lease obligations  either individually or in the aggregate 
critical accounting policies and business practices note of the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies that we use 
many of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a high degree of judgment  either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements 
the following items are the critical accounting policies and business practices that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
basis of revenue recognition we generate revenue from the following primary sources licensing software products  providing customer technical support hereafter referred to as maintenance  and providing professional services  such as consulting and education 
we recognize revenue pursuant to the requirements of statement of position software revenue recognition  sop issued by the american institute of certified public accountants as amended by sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
while these statements substantially govern the basis for software licensing revenue recognition  we believe that we exercise appropriate judgment in applying criteria set forth in these sops to record deferred subscription revenue and to recognize revenue 
in accordance with sop  we recognize revenue from the licensing of our software products when all of the following criteria are met we have entered into a legally binding agreement with a customer  we deliver the products  license agreement terms are deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that it may not be complete and final  and collection is probable 
the company recognizes revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the term of the license 
our software licenses generally do not include acceptance provisions 
an acceptance provision generally allows a customer to test the software for a defined period of time before they commit to licensing the software 
if a license agreement includes an acceptance provision  we do not record deferred subscription revenue or recognize revenue until the earlier of the receipt of a written customer acceptance or  if not notified by the customer to cancel the license agreement  the expiration of the acceptance period 
beginning in october  we began executing software license agreements that include flexible contractual provisions that  among other things  allow customers to receive unspecified future software products for no additional fee 
these agreements combine the right to use the software product with maintenance for the term of the agreement 
under these agreements  we are required to recognize revenue ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the license agreement beginning upon completion of the four sop recognition criteria noted above 
for license agreements signed prior to october  once all four of the above noted revenue recognition criteria were met  software license fees were recognized as revenue up front and the maintenance fees were deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue over the term of the license 

back to index maintenance revenue is derived from two primary sources combined license and maintenance agreements recorded under our prior business model and standalone maintenance agreements recorded under both our prior business model and our current business model 
under our prior business model  maintenance and license fees were generally combined into a single license agreement 
the maintenance portion was deferred and is amortized into revenue over the initial license agreement term 
many of these license agreements have not reached the end of their initial terms and  therefore  continue to amortize 
this amortization is recorded to the maintenance line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the deferred maintenance portion  which was generally optional to the customer  was determined using its fair value based on annual  fixed maintenance renewal rates stated in the agreement 
since we no longer record license agreements under our prior business model  the amount of maintenance deferred as well as the amount of maintenance revenue recognized from such agreements will continue to decrease 
for license agreements entered into under our current business model  maintenance and license fees continue to be combined  however  the maintenance is no longer optional on an annual basis but rather is inclusive for the entire term 
we recognize such combined fees on the subscription revenue line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
under both our prior business model and our current business model  we record standalone maintenance revenue earned from customers who elect optional maintenance for their non term based license agreements 
maintenance revenue from such renewals is recognized over the term of the renewal agreement 
we have experienced renewal rates of approximately for fiscal years and revenue recognition from professional service arrangements begins when all four of the sop revenue recognition criteria as discussed above are met and as the services are performed 
if it is not probable that a project will be completed or the payment will be received  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed 
revenue from sales to distributors  resellers  and vars is generally recognized when all four of the sop revenue recognition criteria noted above are met and when these entities sell the software products to their customers 
this is commonly referred to as the sell through method 
we have an established business practice of offering installment payment options to customers and have a history of successfully collecting primarily all amounts due under such agreements 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if  in our judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  we will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
our standard licensing agreements include a product warranty provision for all products 
such warranties are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote 
under the terms of substantially all of our license agreements  we have agreed to indemnify customers for costs and damages arising from claims against such customers based on  among other things  allegations that our software product infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
in most cases  in the event of an infringement claim  we retain the right to i procure for the customer the right to continue using the software product  ii replace or modify the software product to eliminate the infringement while providing substantially equivalent functionality  or iii if neither i nor ii can be reasonably achieved  we may terminate the license agreement and refund to the customer a pro rata portion of the fees paid 
such indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote 
the indemnification is limited to the amount paid by the customer 
accounts receivable as detailed in the table included in note to the consolidated financial statements as of march   net trade and installment accounts receivable  after accounting for unearned revenue and the allowance for doubtful accounts  were billion 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account used to reserve for potential impairment of accounts receivable on the balance sheet 
it reflects an accounting estimate of unidentified losses in the accounts receivable portfolio resulting from the expectations of not collecting all of these accounts receivable in full 
the valuation allowance relates to two components of receivables a specifically identified receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment  and b all other receivables 
a specific receivable is reviewed for impairment when  based on current information and events  we do not expect to collect fully amounts due according to the contractual terms of the receivable agreement 
factors considered in assessing collectibility include a customer s extended delinquency  requests for restructuring  and filing for bankruptcy 
a specific allowance is provided based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated amounts to be collected 

back to index we review the adequacy of the general allowance for doubtful accounts attributable to the remaining pool of accounts receivable by performing various analytical procedures and considering our history of collections of long term software agreements  as well as the overall economic environment 
a change in the estimated default rate used to calculate the general allowance for doubtful accounts would have an approximate million effect on the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts as of march  we expect the allowance for doubtful accounts to continue to decline as net installment accounts receivable under the prior business model are billed and collected 
under our business model  amounts due from customers are offset by deferred subscription revenue unearned revenue related to these amounts  resulting in little or no carrying value on the balance sheet 
therefore  less of an allowance for doubtful accounts is required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of accounts receivable  net of unearned revenue  for the past two fiscal years has approximated 
deferred tax assets when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction  estimate differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement purposes versus tax return purposes known as temporary differences  which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we have recognized as a deferred tax asset  a portion of the tax benefits connected with losses related to operations  which are expected to result in a future tax benefit 
as of march   the current and noncurrent deferred tax assets  net of a valuation allowance  totaled million and million  respectively  and have been offset against the respective deferred tax liabilities 
this recognition assumes we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that the carryforward of these losses will be realized 
the factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are primarily a result of acquisition expenses  such as duplicate facility costs  employee severance and other costs  foreign net operating losses nols  and the recognition of subscription revenue pursuant to our business model 
the nols generally expire between and an additional valuation allowance of million was established in fiscal year for certain foreign deferred tax assets we believe might not be realized 
future results may vary from these estimates 
at this time it is not practicable to determine if we will need to increase the valuation allowance or if such future valuations will have a material impact on our financial statements 
goodwill  capitalized software products  and other intangible assets we account for goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill 
as a result of various acquisitions completed under the purchase method  goodwill constitutes a significant portion of our total assets 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
the first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and are based on our best estimate of future revenue and operating costs and general market conditions 
these estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management 
this approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows including timing  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  and a terminal growth rate 

back to index during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we performed our annual impairment review and recorded a non cash charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with our professional services organization to its fair value as of march  this charge resulted from the weak spending environment that affected the it service sector in general  as well as our continued shift in focus to professional services engagements that are focused solely on our software products 
the impairment charge was recorded to the goodwill impairment line item in the consolidated statements of operations 
the carrying value of capitalized software products  both purchased software and internally developed software  and other intangible assets  are reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of internal and external facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment 
such facts and circumstances considered include an assessment of the net realizable value for capitalized software products and the future recoverability of cost for other intangible assets as of the balance sheet date 
it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood of any possible future impairments or  if such an impairment were to occur  the magnitude thereof 
new accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that entities record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
this pronouncement is effective for us beginning april  this pronouncement will not have a material impact on the company upon adoption 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
 among other things  rescinds sfas no 
 which required all gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt to be classified as an extraordinary item  and amends sfas no 
to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
we adopted sfas no 
effective july  as a result  we recorded a million gain in fiscal year from the early retirement of a portion of our debt which was included in the interest expense  net line item on the consolidated statements of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
also established that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we have not entered into any significant exit or disposal activities since the effective date of this statement 
as such  sfas no 
has not had an impact on the company 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
interpretation no 
requires a guarantor to include disclosure of certain obligations  and if applicable  at the inception of the guarantee  recognize a liability for the fair value of other certain obligations undertaken in issuing a guarantee 
the recognition requirement was effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  we adopted interpretation no 
effective december and the applicable disclosures have been made 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
issue provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of issue will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal year periods beginning after june  that are not within the scope of higher level accounting literature  including sop we do not believe that the adoption of issue will have a material impact on the company 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends certain provisions of sfas no 
and is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  beginning in fiscal year  we will adopt the fair value based method of recording stock options outlined in sfas no 
under the fair value based method  we will charge to expense the computed value of all newly granted stock options over the vesting period based on the options fair value at the date of grant 

back to index in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
and applies immediately to any variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an interest is obtained after that date 
this interpretation is applicable for us in the second quarter of fiscal year  which ends september   for interests acquired in variable interest entities prior to february  this interpretation requires variable interest entities to be consolidated if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit an entity to finance its activities without support from other parties or the equity investors lack certain  specified characteristics 
the adoption of this interpretation for variable interest entities created after january  did not have a material impact on the company 
we are continuing to review the provisions of this interpretation to determine its impact  if any  on future reporting periods with respect to interests in variable interest entities created prior to february   but we do not currently anticipate any material accounting or disclosure requirements under the provisions of this interpretation 
i n april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of sfas no 
on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
in particular  this statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative 
it also clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and is not expected to have an impact on the company upon adoption 
risk factors current and potential stockholders should consider carefully the risk factors described below 
any of these factors  or others  many of which are beyond our control  could negatively affect our revenue  profitability  and cash flow in the future 
operating results and revenue are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors 
quarterly and annual results of operations are affected by a number of factors  including those listed below  which in turn could adversely affect our revenue  profitability  and cash flow in the future 
demand for products and services  length of sales cycle  customer implementation of our products  magnitude of price and product competition  introduction of new hardware  general economic conditions in countries in which customers do a substantial amount of business  customer budgets for hardware and software  ability to develop and introduce new or enhanced versions of our products  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  ability to control costs  the size of licensing transactions  reorganizations of the sales and technical services forces  settlement of litigation  ability to retain and attract qualified personnel  and reaction of customers to our business model 
any of the foregoing factors  among others  may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high or cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate 
as a consequence  our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow could be adversely affected 
the success of our international operations is subject to many factors 
international revenue has historically represented approximately of our total worldwide revenue 
continued success in selling our products outside of the united states will depend on a variety of factors  including reorganizations of the sales and technical services forces  fluctuations in foreign exchange currency rates  staffing key managerial positions  general economic conditions in foreign countries  political instability  and trade restrictions such as tariffs  duties  or other controls affecting foreign operations 
increase in tariffs  the imposition of trade restrictions  or other factors could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 

back to index our products must remain compatible with ever changing operating environments 
ibm  hp  sun microsystems  and microsoft are the largest suppliers of systems and computing software and  in most cases  are the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of our customers 
historically  these operating system developers have modified or introduced new operating systems  systems software  and computer hardware 
such new products could in the future incorporate features that perform functions currently performed by our products or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software 
although we have to date been able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and system software developers  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to such changes or customer decisions to forego the use of our products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or operating system could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
the computer software business is highly competitive 
the market in which we compete is marked by rapid and substantial technological change  the steady emergence of new companies and products  evolving industry standards  and changing customer needs 
we compete with many established companies in the markets we serve  and some of these companies may have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources  larger distribution capabilities  earlier access to customers  and greater opportunity to address customers various information technology requirements than us 
we also compete with many smaller  less established companies that may be able to focus more effectively on specific product segments or markets 
historically  we have competed primarily on the basis of our products features and performance 
as product pricing becomes a more important criterion for our customers  we may experience increased competition from certain  low price competitors 
to remain competitive  we must develop new products and continue to enhance existing products 
we may be unsuccessful in our ability to develop new releases or new products that meet the needs of our customers in light of competitive alternatives available in the market 
in addition  the introduction of new products or versions of existing products may not meet with customer acceptance or may be delayed 
our inability to bring new products and enhancements to existing products to the market in a timely manner or the failure for these products to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
certain software is licensed from third parties 
some of our products contain software licensed from third parties 
some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or allow our products to remain competitive 
the loss of these licenses or the ability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or enhancement of existing products 
this could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
failure to protect our intellectual property rights would weaken our competitive position 
our future success is dependent upon our proprietary technology 
we protect our proprietary information through the use of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  policing unauthorized use or copying of our proprietary information is difficult 
unauthorized use or copying occurs from time to time and litigation to enforce intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and diversion of resources 
moreover  the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not afford the same degree of protection to our proprietary rights as do the laws of the united states 
for example  shrink wrap or click on licenses may be unenforceable in whole or in part in some jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  patents we have obtained may be circumvented  challenged  invalidated  or designed around by other companies 
our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property for these or other reasons could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
customers are still adapting to our business model 
our business model affords customers greater flexibility in licensing transactions 
for example  under the business model  we offer software licenses on a month to month or other short term basis in order to allow customers the opportunity to try our software products without committing to a multi year license obligation 
transactions such as these increase the risk that customers will not fully implement our software and will not enter into a long term relationship with us 
this effect could be diminished if customers elect cost certainty by committing to longer license agreement periods 
additionally  customer preference for payment upfront  annual or monthly installments could impact the amount of cash generated from operations in any period 
this could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 

back to index changes to compensation of our sales organization 
we update our compensation plan for the sales organization annually 
these plans are intended to align with our business model objectives of providing customer flexibility and satisfaction 
the compensation plan may encourage behavior not anticipated or intended as it is implemented  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
we have a significant amount of debt 
as of march   we had approximately billion of debt outstanding  which consists of bank credit lines  unsecured fixed rate senior note obligations  convertible senior notes  and unsecured multi currency credit facilities 
we expect that existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  expected cash provided from operations  and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements 
failure to generate sufficient cash as the debt becomes due or to renew credit lines prior to their expiration may adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
we may become dependent upon large transactions 
we have historically been dependent upon large dollar enterprise transactions with individual customers 
as a result of the flexibility afforded by our business model  we anticipate that there will be fewer of these transactions in the future 
there can be no assurances  however  that we will not be reliant on large dollar enterprise transactions in the future  and the failure to close such transactions could adversely affect our business  financial conditions  operating results  and cash flow 
growth depends upon successful integration of acquisitions 
our growth strategy is based upon internal development of technology  selective acquisitions  and integration of such acquisitions into ongoing operations 
implementation of this growth strategy may result in strains on our management team  internal systems  and financial resources 
difficulties encountered in successfully integrating acquired companies and products may adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
we could be subject to fines  penalties  or other sanctions as a result of a joint inquiry by the sec and us attorney s office 
as previously reported  we have been cooperating with an ongoing joint inquiry being conducted by the staff of the northeast regional office of the securities and exchange commission and the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of new york concerning certain of our accounting practices 
see item legal proceedings 
although we are unable at this point to predict the scope or outcome of this inquiry  it is possible that it could result in the institution of administrative  civil injunctive or criminal proceedings  the imposition of fines and penalties  suspensions or disbarments from government contracts  and or other remedies and sanctions 
the conduct of these proceedings could negatively impact our stock price 
in addition  we expect to continue to incur expenses associated with responding to these agencies  regardless of the outcome  and this may divert the efforts and attention of our management team from normal business operations 
our credit ratings could be downgraded 
in march  moody s investors service downgraded our senior unsecured long term debt rating and shifted its rating outlook on us from stable to negative 
in addition  in february standard poor s revised its rating outlook on us from stable to negative 
we cannot assure investors that moody s  standard poor s  or any other rating agency will not further downgrade our credit ratings in the future 
if our credit ratings are downgraded  we could be required to  among other things  pay additional interest under our credit agreements or other debt 
any such downgrades could also affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and will affect the terms of any such financing 
customer decisions are influenced by general economic conditions 
our products are designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of our customers information processing resources 
in a recessionary environment  our products are often a reasonable economic alternative for customers faced with the prospect of incurring expenditures to increase their existing information processing resources 
however  a general slowdown in the world economy or a particular region could cause customers to delay or forgo decisions to license new products or upgrades to their existing environments and this could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 

back to index the software business is marked by easy entry and large  entrenched businesses 
many companies with whom we compete  including ibm  sun microsystems  hp  and other large computer manufacturers  have substantial resources  a larger installed base of customers in any particular market niche  as well as the ability to develop and market software programs similar to and competitive with the products offered by us 
additionally  these producers can bundle hardware  software  and services together  which is a disadvantage for us since we cannot install hardware and have far fewer services offerings 
competitive products are also offered by numerous independent software companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry 
some  like microsoft  oracle  and sap  are the leading developers and vendors in their specialized markets 
in addition  new companies enter the market on a frequent and regular basis  offering products that compete with those offered by us 
increased competition also results from consolidation of existing companies within the industry 
additionally  many customers historically have developed their own products that compete with those offered by us 
competition from any of these sources can result in price reductions  or displacement of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
future product development is dependent upon access to third party operating systems 
in the past  licensees using proprietary operating systems were furnished with source code  which makes the operating system generally understandable to programmers  and object code  which directly controls the hardware and other technical documentation 
since the availability of source code facilitated the development of systems and applications software  which must interface with the operating systems  independent software vendors such as us were able to develop and market compatible software 
microsoft  ibm  and other vendors have a policy of restricting the use or availability of the source code for some of their operating systems 
to date  this policy has not had a material effect on us 
some companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
these restrictions may  in the future  result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products 
although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect  there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
third party microcode could impact product development 
we anticipate ongoing use of microcode or firmware provided by hardware manufacturers 
microcode and firmware are essentially software programs in hardware form and are therefore less flexible than other types of software 
we believe that such continued use will not have a significant impact on our operations and that our products will remain compatible with any changes to such code 
however  there can be no assurance that future technological developments involving such microcode will not have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
the markets for some or all of our key product areas may not grow 
we have identified six product areas enterprise management  security  storage  portal and business intelligence  application life cycle management  and data management and application development 
some or all of these areas may not grow  may decline in growth  or customers may decline or forgo use of products in some or all of these product areas 
this is particularly true in newly emerging areas  such as portal and business intelligence 
a decline in these product areas could result in decreased demand for our products  which would adversely impact our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
third parties could claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
from time to time we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement of various forms of their intellectual property 
investigation of these claims  whether with or without merit  can be expensive and could affect development  marketing  or shipment of our products 
as the number of software patents issued increases  it is likely that additional claims  with or without merit  will be asserted 
defending against such claims is time consuming and could result in significant litigation expense or settlement with unfavorable terms that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
fluctuations in foreign currencies could result in transaction losses 
most of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  it is not possible to predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
given the relatively long sales cycle that is typical for many of our products  foreign currency fluctuations could result in substantial changes in the foreign currency impact on these transactions 
additionally  deterioration of the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the us dollar can affect our ability to increase our revenue within those markets  all of which may adversely impact our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 

back to index acts of terrorism or war may adversely affect our business 
acts of terrorism  acts of war  and other unforeseen events may cause damage or disruption to our properties  business  employees  suppliers  distributors  resellers  and customers  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
such events may also result in an economic slowdown in the united states or elsewhere  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
our stock price is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  the gain or loss of significant license agreements  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in domestic and international economic and business conditions  general conditions in the software and computer industries  and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies in industries that are similar or related to those in which we operate and that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these market fluctuations have in the past adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
potential european union tariffs or united states congressional action in connection with the extraterritorial income case could adversely affect our business 
the world trade organization wto recently authorized sanctions against the united states for operating the extraterritorial income regime 
this regime relates to a provision in the united states tax code providing tax incentives on products manufactured in the united states and exported for sale 
the wto has ruled the regime to be an illegal export subsidy and has now authorized the european union eu to impose tariffs on certain united states made products imported into the eu 
eu officials have indicated that they will not raise tariffs provided that the united states shows substantial progress and a commitment to act within the next year 
we cannot be certain  however  what impact the potential eu tariffs could have on the software industry or the economy in general 
additionally  we cannot be certain that any legislation replacing the extraterritorial income regime will continue to provide us with the level of tax incentives received under the existing regime 
we currently save approximately million per year in united states federal income tax under the current extraterritorial income regime 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio  debt  and installment accounts receivable 
we have a prescribed methodology whereby we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of government agencies and high quality corporate issuers standard poor s single a rating and higher 
to mitigate risk  many of the securities have a maturity date within one year  and holdings of any one issuer  excluding the us government  do not exceed of the portfolio 
periodically  the portfolio is reviewed and adjusted if the credit rating of a security held has deteriorated 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk 
we maintain a blend of both fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
as of march   our outstanding debt approximated billion  with approximately billion in fixed rate obligations 
if market rates were to decline  we could be required to make payments on the fixed rate debt that would exceed those based on current market rates 
each basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million 
each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an approximate million annual effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balances of such debt as of march under our prior business model  we offered financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our software solution sales 
the aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element  which can vary with the interest rate environment 
each basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business on a worldwide basis through subsidiaries in countries 
we are therefore exposed to movement in currency exchange rates 
as part of our risk management strategy and consistent with prior years  we did not enter into any foreign exchange derivative transactions 
in addition  we manage our level of exposure by denominating a majority of international sales and payments of related expense in the local currencies of our subsidiaries 
a change in all foreign currencies against the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our results from operations 

back to index equity price risk as of march   we have minimal investments in marketable equity securities of publicly traded companies 
these investments were considered available for sale with any unrealized gains or temporary losses deferred as a component of stockholders equity 
it is not customary for us to make investments in equity securities as part of our investment strategy
