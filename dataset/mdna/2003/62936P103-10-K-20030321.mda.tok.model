item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our objective is to build a profitable biopharmaceutical company by discovering  developing and commercializing small molecule drugs and recombinant proteins 
our current product candidates are primarily for the treatment of bone and mineral disorders  gastrointestinal disorders and central nervous system disorders 
our product pipeline consists of product candidates in various stages of clinical development and preclinical development 
two of these product candidates  preos and cinacalcet hcl  are in phase iii clinical trials 
a third product candidate  alx  has completed a pilot phase ii clinical trial and plans are underway to commence additional clinical trials 
preos and alx are proprietary to and are being developed by us 
preos is our recombinant  full length parathyroid hormone for the treatment of osteoporosis  and alx is our analog of glucagon like peptide for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders such as short bowel syndrome and crohn s disease 
cinacalcet hcl  our orally active  small molecule compound for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism  is being developed by our licensees  amgen inc and kirin brewery company  ltd 
additional phase i clinical development programs include calcilytic compounds for the treatment of osteoporosis  nps for epilepsy and migraine  and nps for acute depression 
we collaborate on three preclinical programs with astrazeneca ab  glaxosmithkline and janssen pharmaceutica nv  a subsidiary of johnson johnson 
we have incurred cumulative losses from inception through december  of approximately million  net of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as we continue our current and anticipated development projects  particularly our clinical trial programs for preos  alx  and nps  as we maintain our contractual commitment to fund research activities in our metabotropic glutamate receptor program  and as we develop marketing  sales and manufacturing capabilities 
results of operations revenues 
substantially all our revenues have come from license fees  research and development support or milestone payments from our licensees and collaborators 
these revenues fluctuate from year to year 
our revenues were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in revenues from to and the increase from to were primarily due to the recognition of milestone payments from our licensees amgen  kirin  forest  and janssen in similar milestones were not recognized in either or we recognized revenue from our agreements as follows under our agreement with glaxosmithkline  we recognized  in   in  and million in  under our agreement with kirin  we recognized nothing in  million in and million in  under our agreement with amgen  we recognized nothing in  million in  and  in  under our agreement with forest  we recognized nothing in  million in  and  in  under our agreement with lilly canada  we recognized nothing in each of and  and million in  under our agreement with janssen  we recognized nothing in  million in  and million in  and under our research funding agreement with the government of canada  we recognized million in  million in  and  in see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion of payments that we may earn in the future under these agreements 
research and development 
our research and development expenses arise primarily from compensation and other related costs of our personnel who are dedicated to research and development activities and from the fees paid and costs reimbursed to outside professionals to conduct research  clinical studies and trials  and to manufacture drug compounds and related supplies prior to fda approval 
our research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and million in research and development expenses increased from to and from to principally due to the costs of conducting our clinical trials for preos  including the costs of our pivotal phase iii trial for which enrollment began during and was completed in march  increased activities in the development of alx and costs to arrange for manufacturing and to manufacture clinical supplies of preos and alx  including costs related to a commercial manufacturing agreement signed in october with boehringer ingelheim austria gmbh for the manufacture of bulk drug supplies of preos in support of commercial launch 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of our management and administrative staff  business insurance  taxes  professional fees and market research and promotion activities for our product candidates 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and million in the increases in general and administrative expenses from and to are due primarily to increased marketing activities associated with preos and the hiring of additional marketing personnel 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
goodwill and purchased intangibles originated with our december acquisition of allelix biopharmaceuticals  inc allelix 
the remaining intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  at december  totaled approximately million 
amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles decreased from million in and million in to million in the decrease in is the result of our adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  sfas no 
eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
during and  we recorded amortization expense of million and million  respectively  or and  respectively  per basic and diluted share  that would not have been recorded under sfas no 
in process research and development acquired 
we recorded an expense of million in for in process research and development that we acquired as part of our purchase of allelix 
the acquired in process research and development consisted of five drug development programs  of which preos  for osteoporosis  and alx  for gastrointestinal disorders  accounted for percent of the total value 
since the date of the acquisition  we revised our plans for the next series of clinical trials for preos and alx we started a pivotal phase iii clinical trial with preos 
we have also completed a pilot phase ii clinical trial with alx in adults with short bowel syndrome 
since the date of acquisition and through december   we have incurred development costs of approximately million for preos and million for alx total development costs and time to completion for each of these product candidates will depend on the costs we incur to conduct current clinical trials and to perform any additional work we find necessary to obtain fda approval 
we believe the assumptions we used in the valuation of the in process research and development we acquired from allelix were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
however  we have modified our development plans as new data have become available regarding each product candidate 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results in the valuation 
total other income  net 
our total other income  net  decreased from million in to million in the decrease form to was mainly the result of decreased interest income of million and decreased gain on sale of marketable investment securities of million  both the result of lower interest rates and lower average cash  cash equivalent  and marketable investment securities balances 
balances of cash  cash equivalent and marketable investment securities during the fiscal year ended december  decreased as a result of the need to fund current operations and will continue to decrease as we operate our business  however  we were able to increase our cash  cash equivalent and marketable investment securities due primarily to proceeds we received from a public offering of million shares of our common stock  which was completed in october additionally during  we recognized income of million from equity method investments and recognized only  from equity method investments in our total other income  net  increased from million in to million in the increase from to was mainly the result of increased interest income of million in the increase in interest income was the result of higher average balances of cash  cash equivalent and marketable investment securities 
these balances increased primarily due to proceeds we received from our private placement offering of million shares of our common stock which was closed in april and from a public offering of million shares of our common stock which was completed in november in addition  the gain on the sale of marketable investment securities increased by million in due to a decreasing interest rate environment resulting in larger realized gains on marketable investment securities 
finally  during  we recognized income of from equity method investments 
a similar income amount was not recognized in taxes as of december   we had a united states federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a united states federal income tax research credit carryforward of approximately million 
we also had a canadian federal and provincial income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and million  respectively  a canadian research pool carryforward of approximately million and a canadian investment tax credit carryforward of approximately million 
our ability to utilize the united states operating loss and credit carryforwards against future taxable income will be subject to annual limitations in future periods pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue code of cumulative effect on prior years to december  of changing to a different revenue recognition method 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 

sab no 
provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
under our previous accounting policy  revenues from nonrefundable licensing fees were recognized when received when we had no further obligations relative to such licensing fees 
in compliance with sab no 
 we now recognize revenues from nonrefundable licensing fees over the continuing involvement period with each licensee 
the adoption of sab no 
resulted in an increase in operating income of  and no change in the net loss for the year ended december  prior year financial statements have not been restated to reflect the change in accounting principle 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations since inception primarily through payments received under collaborative research and license agreements and the private and public issuance and sale of equity securities 
as of december   we had recognized million of cumulative revenues from payments for research support  license fees and milestone payments and million from the sale of equity securities for cash 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities  which totaled million at december  the primary objectives for our marketable investment securities portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are intended to achieve the highest rate of return to us  consistent with these two objectives 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
we could receive future milestone payments of up to million in the aggregate if each of our current licensees accomplishes the specified research and or development milestones provided in the respective agreements 
in addition  all of the agreements require the licensees to make royalty payments to us if they sell products covered by the terms of our license agreements 
however  we do not control the subject matter  timing or resources applied by our licensees to their development programs 
thus  potential receipt of milestone and royalty payments from these licensees is largely beyond our control 
some of the late stage development milestone payments from astrazeneca will not be due if we elect a co promotion option under which we may commercialize products 
further  each of these agreements may be terminated before its scheduled expiration date by the respective licensee either for any reason or under certain conditions 
prior to the time that we acquired allelix in december  allelix had entered into a research funding agreement with the government of canada pursuant to the technology partnership canada program 
under this agreement  the government of canada is obligated to reimburse us for up to percent of eligible research and development costs we incur for our alx product candidate through december up to a maximum of cdn 
million 
through december   we have invoiced the canadian government for a total of cdn 
million and have received payment on this amount 
during  we have recognized revenue of cnd 
million under the technology partnership s canada program through june in july  we began negotiations with the canadian government to pursue mutually acceptable adjustments to the terms of the agreement 
as these negotiations are still ongoing  the outcome of which is uncertain  we have not recognized any revenue under this agreement during the six months ended december   although we have incurred development costs during this period we believe qualify for reimbursement of the remaining cnd 
 up to the maximum cnd 
million 
the agreement provides the government of canada with a percent royalty on revenues we receive from the sale or license of alx our royalty obligation terminates on december   if we have paid at least cdn 
million 
if we have not paid that amount of royalties by that date  our royalty obligation continues until the earlier of the date we have paid cdn 
million  or december  the agreement imposes a number of obligations on us to conduct certain development activities within canada and use canadian based companies to provide certain services in connection with the development of alx for example  the agreement requires us to produce in canada clinical and commercial supplies of alx in addition  the agreement requires us to enter into a licensing agreement with a pharmaceutical company operating in canada for the conduct of phase iii clinical trials and commercialization of alx the agreement also prohibits us from entering into any licensing agreement for the further development  production and marketing of alx without the prior written consent of the government of canada 
in general  the agreement includes on going commitments to create manufacturing  marketing and sales jobs in canada 
we have used and currently use non canadian based companies for some of these services 
for example  we arranged for a non canadian contract manufacturer to manufacture bulk supplies of alx for our phase ii clinical trials 
certain violations of the terms of the agreement  if pursued by canada  might result in a forfeiture of the technology to canada or other adverse consequences 
we notified the government of canada of our arrangements and received their authorization to proceed 
if we cannot reach an agreement with the government of canada on amending certain provisions of the agreement  we may choose to abandon or find it impractical to continue our development of alx if we do reach an agreement  we could be required to make payments that are material in amount 
we have entered into certain research and license agreements that require us to make research support payments to academic or research institutions when the research is performed 
additional payments may be required upon the accomplishment of research milestones by the institutions or as license fees or royalties to maintain the licenses 
as of december   we have a total commitment of up to million for future research support and milestone payments 
further  depending on the commercial success of certain of our products  we may be required to pay license fees or royalties 
we expect to enter into additional sponsored research and license agreements in the future 
under our agreement with astrazeneca  we are required to co direct the research and pay for an equal share of the preclinical research costs  including capital and a minimum number of personnel  through at least september and  under certain circumstances  through march additionally  as of december   we have a commitment for future manufacturing of preos of approximately million 
we expect to enter into additional collaborative research agreements and manufacturing agreements in the future  which may require up front payments and long term commitments of cash 
the following represents the contractual obligations of the company as of december  in millions contractual obligations total operating leases purchase commitments we expect that our existing capital resources including interest earned thereon  will be sufficient to allow us to maintain our current and planned operations through however  our actual needs will depend on numerous factors  including the progress and scope of our internally funded research  development and commercialization activities  our ability to comply with the terms of our research funding agreements  our ability to maintain existing collaborations  our decision to seek additional collaboration  the success of our collaborators in developing and marketing products under their respective collaborations with us  competing technological and market developments  the time and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  the extent to which we choose to commercialize our future products through our own sales and marketing capabilities  our success in producing clinical supplies of our product candidates on a timely basis sufficient to meet the needs of our clinical trials  the costs we incur in obtaining and enforcing patent and other proprietary rights or gaining the freedom to operate under the patents of others  and our success in acquiring and integrating complementary products  technologies or businesses 
our clinical trials may be modified or terminated for several reasons including the risk that our product candidates will demonstrate safety concerns  the risk that regulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates for further development or may require additional or expanded clinical trials to be performed  and the risk that our manufacturers may not be able to supply sufficient quantities of our drug candidates to support our clinical trials  which could lead to a disruption or cessation of the clinical trials 
we do not have on hand sufficient supplies of our product candidates to meet all of our clinical trial requirements and we are dependent on outside manufacturers to provide these supplies on a timely basis 
we currently have sufficient clinical supplies of preos to complete our top study  but have not yet produced sufficient quantities of preos to meet all of our clinical trial needs 
if any of the events that pose these risks comes to fruition  we may have to substantially modify or terminate current and planned clinical trials  our business may be materially harmed  our stock price may be adversely affected  and our ability to raise additional capital may be impaired 
we need to raise substantial additional funds to support our long term research  product development  and commercialization programs 
the company regularly considers various fund raising alternatives  including  for example  partnering of existing programs  monitizing of potential revenue streams  debt or equity financing and merger and acquisition alternatives 
we may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances  collaborations  or license agreements and other financing mechanisms 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs  or to obtain funds through arrangements with licensees or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates that we may otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own 
on february   we entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization  or merger agreement  with enzon pharmaceuticals  inc  which sets forth the terms and conditions of the proposed merger of nps and enzon 
pursuant to the merger agreement  a subsidiary of a newly organized delaware corporation  momentum merger corporation  will merge with and into nps  with nps surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of momentum merger corporation  and enzon will merge with and into another newly organized  wholly owned subsidiary of momentum merger corporation  with such subsidiary surviving 
we currently plan to complete the proposed mergers during the second quarter of however  we can neither assure you that the mergers will be completed nor can we predict the exact timing of the completion of the mergers because they are subject to governmental and regulatory review processes and other conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
if the mergers are not completed  we will still be required to make substantial payments to service providers and advisors that we have engaged to assist us in the transactions  which will impact our capital resources 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
we earn our revenue from research and development support payments  license fees and milestone payments 
as described below  significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we apply the provisions of sab no 
 to all of our revenue transactions 
we recognize revenue from our research and development support agreements as related research and development costs are incurred and from milestone payments as agreed upon events representing the achievement of substantive steps in the development process are achieved and where the amount of the milestone payment  approximates the value of achieving the milestone 
we recognize nonrefundable license fees over the period we have continuing involvement 
cash received in advance of the performance of the related research and development support and for nonrefundable license fees when we have continuing involvement is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the period of our continuing involvement 
where questions arise about contract interpretation  contract performance  or possible breach  we continue to recognize revenue unless we determine that such circumstances are material and or that payment is not probable 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
our balance sheet reflects net intangible assets of million  long lived assets of million  and goodwill of million as of december  when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
to date  we have not determined the existence of any indication of impairment sufficient to require us to adjust our historical measure of value of such assets 
in  statement on financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we have ceased amortizing goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we performed an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and we will perform an annual impairment review thereafter 
as of january   we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  all of which were subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded amortization expense of million and million  respectively  or and  respectively  per basic and diluted share  that would not have been recorded under sfas no 
the assembled workforce component of identifiable intangible assets was fully amortized as of december  we completed our impairment review of goodwill during and determined that no impairment charge was required 
we did not record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review in the first quarter of  nor on our annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
we are required and plan to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for the quarter ending march  to accomplish this  we must identify legal obligations for asset retirement obligations  if any  and determine the fair value of these obligations on the date of adoption 
we have not completed our analysis of the impact of sfas no 
 but we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others the interpretation  which addresses the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
the interpretation also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees 
the interpretation requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the non contingent component of the guarantee  this is the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception 
the recognition of the liability is required even if it is not probable that payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements 
we made additional disclosures upon adopting the disclosure requirements of the interpretation as of december   and will apply the recognition and measurement provisions for all guarantees entered into or modified after december  the emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables issue no 
 addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
issue no 
addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying issue no 
 separate contracts with the same entity or related parties that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated as a package and should  therefore  be evaluated as a single arrangement in considering whether there are one or more units of accounting 
that presumption may be overcome if there is sufficient evidence to the contrary 
issue no 
also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
we are required and plan to adopt the provisions of issue no 
for the quarter ending september  because of the effort necessary to comply with issue no 
 it is not practicable for management to estimate the impact of adopting this statement as of the date of this report 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation no 
 which addresses consolidation principles for certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties variable interest entities or vie 
the interpretation is effective for all entities or structures created after january  and is effective for us for any existing entities or structures as of july  all entities with significant variable interests in a vie must make certain disclosures depending on the type of involvement with the vie 
if it is reasonably possible that at the effective date we will be required either to consolidate or make disclosure about our involvement with a vie  we must make the applicable disclosures in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we have determined that we have no vie accounting facts or circumstances  and thus we were not required to make any additional disclosures upon adopting the disclosure requirements of interpretation no 
for the year ended december   and will apply prospectively the consolidation provisions for any vie entered into after january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our primary objectives in managing our investment portfolio are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
the securities we hold in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
at any time  sharp changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and its interest earnings 
after a review of our marketable investment securities  we believe that in the event of a hypothetical percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
we have established policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest in highly liquid  investment grade securities and money market funds of various issues  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component in stockholders equity 
foreign currency risk 
some of our research and development operations are in canada 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as a change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  or by weak economic conditions in canada 
when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  the cost of expenses in canada decreases 
when the us dollar weakens against the canadian dollar  the cost of expenses in canada increases 
the monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiary which are impacted by the foreign currency fluctuations are cash  marketable investment securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and certain accrued liabilities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar from the december  rate would cause the fair value of such monetary assets and liabilities in canada to change by an insignificant amount 
we are not currently engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities
