auto other total revenues revenues increased from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of from million to million and increased from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of from million to million 
a significant portion of these increases resulted from growth in the dollar volume of mortgage and home equity loans closed and sold  as well as a steady increase in mortgage revenue earned per loan 
mortgage revenues increased from million to million from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of and from million to million from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of prime refinance mortgages accounted for and of mortgage closed loan volume and and of mortgage revenue in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively

the company also expects that home equity revenues will grow throughout as volumes increase 
auto revenues decreased from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of from million to million and increased from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of from million to million 
the decline in is largely attributed to strong competition from the auto manufacturers in the form of widely available incentive financing rates  such as interest rate specials 
the company lowered interest rates on auto loans to try and remain competitive as evidenced in the decline in average basis points per loan from the first quarter of through the fourth quarter of however  since the company cannot compete with interest rate specials  the company experienced a significant decline in the volume of auto loans funded  most severely from the first quarter in to the second quarter in this resulted in sharp declines in auto revenues from the first quarter of through the fourth quarter of the increase in auto revenues during is largely a result of the new qspe structure introduced in june that improved our ability to offer competitive rates to consumers while increasing our gain on sale execution compared to our prior correspondent loan sales 
the company assumes continued pressure from incentive financing rates coupled with reduced sub prime volume due to the loss of americredit  the company s largest sub prime auto loan purchaser  will result in relatively flat auto revenues as compared to the following table summarizes dollar volume of loans closed and sold and the revenue in both dollars and average basis points bps dollars in thousands except bps march  june  sept

auto  other total direct margin     direct margin increased from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of from million to million and increased from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of from million to million 
the growth in direct margin is due largely to the contribution from increased mortgage and home equity volume  as well as increased revenue per loan  coupled with technology and process improvements 
additionally  the increase in direct margin is due to the positive spread of interest income over interest expense 
the company anticipates that mortgage revenue per loan and the spread of interest income over interest expense will decline throughout  as the overall level of refinance activity declines and competitive pricing pressure increases 
auto direct margin turned negative in the second quarter of as loan volume declined due to the industry s broad use of low interest rate financing incentives 
the company was unable to lower interest rates on auto loans to a competitive level in the heavy interest rate incentive environment and therefore sustained sharp decreases in overall volume and the resulting revenue from that volume 
the decline in auto loan volume and revenue was greater than the company s ability to lower related auto operations expenses and resulted in negative direct margins for the second through the fourth quarters of auto direct margins returned to positive levels in the first quarter of and increased from million to million by the fourth quarter of the increase in auto direct margin during is largely a result of the new qspe structure introduced in june that improved our ability to offer competitive rates to consumers while increasing our gain on sale execution compared to our prior correspondent loan sales

these transactions involve the company surrendering control over these assets to assure that the sold assets have been isolated from the company and its creditors 
as e loan auto has met the appropriate tests to be considered a qspe the assets and liabilities of e loan auto are appropriately not consolidated in financial statements of the company 
e loan auto has obtained a secured borrowing facility from merrill lynch bank usa to finance all purchases of loans from the company 
the company recognizes a gain on the sale of auto loan receivables to e loan auto in the period in which the sale occurs  which represents the difference between the sale proceeds to the company and the company s net carrying value of the receivables 
included in the proceeds received by the company from the sale of loans is a beneficial interest related to loans owned by the qspe  which is reflected on the company s balance sheet as a retained interest asset 
these retained interest assets are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as trading assets  and will be marked to market at each subsequent reporting period 
in order to determine the fair value management estimates future excess cash flows to be received by the company over the life of the loans 
the company makes various assumptions in order to determine the fair value of the estimated future excess cash flows to be generated by the auto loans sold to the qspe 
the most significant assumptions are the cumulative credit losses to be incurred on the pool of auto loan receivables sold  prepayment rates of the auto loans and the rate at which the estimated future excess cash flows are discounted 
the assumptions used represent the company s best estimates  and the use of different assumptions could produce different financial results

 accounting for derivative and hedging activities sfas  as subsequently amended by statement of financial accounting no 
in accounting for its derivative financial instruments  sfas requires an entity to recognize all derivative assets or liabilities in the statement of financial condition and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
an entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use in assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffectiveness of the hedge 
these methods must be consistent with the entity s approach to managing risk

the company is a party to rate lock commitments to fund loans at interest rates previously agreed locked by both the company and the borrower for specified periods of time 
when the borrower locks their interest rate  the company effectively extends a put option to the borrower  whereby the borrower is not obligated to enter into the loan agreement  but the company must honor the interest rate for the specified time period 
under sfas interest rate locks are derivatives 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk during the accumulation of interest rate lock commitments and loans prior to sale 
the company utilizes either a best efforts sell forward commitment or a mandatory sell forward commitment to economically hedge the changes in fair value of the loan due to changes in market interest rates 
both best efforts and mandatory sell forward sale commitments are derivatives under sfas throughout the lock period the changes in the market value of interest rate lock commitments  best efforts and mandatory forward sale commitments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses and are included in the statement of operations 
once the loan is funded the company hedges changes in the fair value of the loan  if not previously hedged at time of lock through use of a best efforts sell forward agreement  by entering into a forward delivery commitment at a specified price 
the company s management has made complex judgments in their application of sfas the judgments include the identification of hedging instruments  hedged items  nature of the risk being hedged  and how the hedging instrument s effectiveness will be assessed 
the company designates forward delivery commitments  where the company intends to deliver the underlying loan into the commitment  as a fair value sfas hedge at the commitment date 
in addition  the company designates all non mandatory forward sale agreements as fair value sfas hedges for underlying loans at funding date 
the company does not designate mandatory sell forward agreements as sfas hedges but does utilize them to economically hedge the changes in fair value of rate lock commitments with borrowers for which a non mandatory forward sale agreement has not been obtained 
the company did not have a material gain or loss representing the amount of hedge ineffectiveness related to non mandatory forward sale agreements or delivery commitments during the twelve months ended december  capitalized software 
in  the company adopted sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  which requires that the company expense computer software costs as they are incurred in the preliminary project stage 
once the capitalization criteria of the sop have been met  external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use computer software and payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use computer software are capitalized

as of december   the company had capitalized approximately million in internally developed software costs of which million had been amortized 
reserves for loan originations 
the company sells loans to loan purchasers on a servicing released basis without recourse 
as such  the risk of loss or default by the borrower has generally been assumed by these purchasers 
however  the company is usually required by these purchasers to make certain representations relating to credit information  loan documentation and collateral 
to the extent that the company does not comply with such representations  or there are early payment defaults  the company may be required to repurchase loans or indemnify these purchasers for any losses from borrower defaults 
in connection with a majority of its loan sales agreements  the company is also responsible for a minimum number of payments to be made on each loan  or else the company may be required to refund the premium paid to it by the loan purchaser 
as such  the company records reserves based on certain assumptions in anticipation of future losses as a result of current activity 
loan loss reserves due to violations of representations and warranties are recorded based on a percentage of current month originations 
the company currently calculates this loss rate exposure based on similar lending portfolios 
once the company has endured a complete economic cycle  the rate will be determined based on actual losses as a percentage of origination volume on a historical basis 
premium repayment reserves  generated through early loan prepayments  are recorded based on a rate determined by calculating actual prepayments as a percentage of originations on a historical basis applied to current month originations

valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
management evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the level of the valuation allowance 
at such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of favorable attributes in future tax returns  the company has recorded a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at december  and the company did not set up a valuation allowance against the state deferred tax asset that arose in because it is expected to be fully realized in the provision for income tax expense represents taxes payable for the current period  plus the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities

in particular  the company must maintain a minimum cash and cash equivalents balance of the higher of million including restricted cash or the highest amount required by any other lender or agreement 
additionally  the company is required to maintain at least one other warehouse facility of no less than million 
failure to comply with these  or any other covenants  could result in the obligation to repay all amounts then outstanding 
the company was in compliance with all debt covenants for this agreement during the year ended and at december  in addition  the company has an uncommitted mortgage loan purchase and sale agreement with greenwich capital 
under the terms of this agreement  mortgage loans which are subject to a take out commitment between the company and an investor  but have not yet been purchased  may be sold to greenwich capital with the accompanying trade assignment 
this allows the company to accelerate turnover and provide additional liquidity to fund additional mortgage loans 
on april   the company entered into a loan agreement with christian a 
larsen  the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer  that provided the company with the ability to draw funds up to an aggregate of million upon demand 
the borrowings had an interest rate of the lower of or the maximum legal rate allowed 
additionally  as provided for in the loan agreement  the million commitment was reduced to million as part of the issuance of a convertible note to the charles schwab corporation 
this facility expired on january  on july  the company issued a million convertible note to the charles schwab corporation  which was convertible into shares of its common stock at a conversion price of per share and which was scheduled to mature on january  the convertible note bore interest at a rate of per annum and was payable quarterly 
on march   the company elected to redeem the note prior to its maturity date 
under the terms of the note  the company notified schwab of its intent to redeem the note on april  by payment of  of the unpaid principal as of the date of redemption 
on april   the charles schwab corporation exercised its option to convert the amount due under the note into  shares of the company s common stock  in lieu of repayment  and therefore the note was converted rather than redeemed 
on june   the company secured a million line of credit facility with merrill lynch mortgage capital  inc to support the interim funding of auto loans prior to the sale to the ultimate auto loan purchaser 
the interest rate charged on this line is based on libor plus various percentage points 
this facility expires on june  upon expiration  management believes it will either renew its existing line or obtain sufficient additional lines 
the company was in compliance with all debt covenants for this agreement during the year ended and at december  in  the company sold the majority of its sub prime auto loans to three auto loan purchasers  americredit  roadloans and transouth 
in october  the company terminated its agreement with americredit  its largest sub prime auto loan purchaser 
the company subsequently entered into an agreement with household international as a sub prime auto loan purchaser to replace americredit 
however  the company s management does not anticipate that its current sub prime auto loan purchasers  without americredit  will support the same loan volume 
in june  the company created a qualified special purpose entity  e loan auto fund one  llc e loan auto  which purchases prime auto loans from the company and then holds the loans 
e loan auto finances its purchases through a million credit facility with merrill lynch bank usa  which expires on june  borrowings are collateralized by the related auto loans held by e loan auto 
the company is not obligated to repay any balance outstanding under the credit facility that exists between e loan auto and merrill lynch bank usa 
upon expiration  the company anticipates that e loan auto will either renew its existing line or obtain sufficient additional lines 
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents as of december  will be sufficient to fund its operating activities  capital expenditures and other obligations for the next twelve months 
however  if during that period or thereafter the company is not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations  or in raising additional funds when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to the company  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of its then current stockholders would be reduced 
the following are the company s return on equity and asset ratios for the years ended december  and december  return on assets return on equity equity to assets net income loss divided by average total assets  multiplied by net income loss divided by average equity  multiplied by average equity divided by average total assets  multiplied by factors affecting future operating results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
while we achieved our first profitable year during fiscal  we have a history of losses  and we may not be able to maintain profitability while we achieved our first profitable year during  as of december   we have an accumulated deficit of million 
because we expect our operating costs will increase to accommodate expected growth in loan applications  we will need to generate significant revenues to maintain profitability 
we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
if revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate  or if operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
we have a limited operating history and consequently face significant risks and challenges in building our business we were incorporated in august  initiated our online mortgage operations in june and acquired our online auto operations in september we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate successfully if a downturn in the mortgage or auto business occurs 
as a result of our limited operating history  our recent growth and our reporting responsibilities as a public company  we may need to expand operational  financial and administrative systems and control procedures to enable us to further train and manage our employees and coordinate the efforts of our underwriting  accounting  finance  marketing  and operations departments 
our quarterly financial results are vulnerable to significant fluctuations and seasonality  which could adversely affect our stock price our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
certain months or quarters have historically experienced a greater volume of purchase money mortgage and auto loan applications and funded loans 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock may fall 
interest rate fluctuations could significantly reduce customers incentive to refinance existing mortgage loans a significant percentage of our mortgage customers use our services to refinance existing mortgages and they are motivated to do so primarily when interest rates fall below the rates of their existing mortgages 
in the event interest rates significantly increase  consumers incentive to refinance will be greatly reduced and the number of loans that we originate could significantly decline 
our ability to engage in profitable secondary sales of loans may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates the mortgage loan purchase commitments we obtain are contingent upon our delivery of the relevant loans to the purchasers within specified periods 
to the extent that we are unable to deliver the loans within the specified periods and interest rates increase during those periods  we may experience no gain or even a loss on the sale of these loans 
in addition  any increase in interest rates will increase the cost of maintaining our warehouse and repurchase lines of credit on which we depend to fund the loans we originate 
the interest direct margin earned on loans held for sale significantly benefited from the spread between long term and short term interest rates during and in based on historical trends  we would not expect the same level of benefit from interest rate spreads in a normal market 
we have implemented a hedging program to manage the risk of loss due to fluctuations in interest rates  but our hedging efforts may not be successful  and no hedging strategy can completely eliminate interest rate risk 
a sharp decrease in interest rates over a short period may cause customers who have interest rates on mortgages committed through us to either delay closing their loans or refinance with another lender 
if this occurs in significant numbers  it may have an adverse effect on our business or quarterly results of operations 
our hedging strategy may not succeed in reducing our exposure to losses caused by fluctuations in interest rates we attempt to manage our interest rate risk exposure through hedging transactions using a combination of forward sales of mortgage backed securities and forward whole loan sales to fix the sales price of loans we expect to fund 
an effective hedging strategy is complex  and we have limited experience administering a hedging program 
a successful hedging program depends in part on our ability to properly estimate the number of loans that will actually close and is subject to fluctuations in the prices of mortgage backed securities  which do not necessarily move in tandem with the prices of loans we originate and close 
to the extent that we implement a hedging strategy but are unable to effectively match our purchases and sales of mortgage backed securities with the sale of the closed loans we have originated  our gains on sales of mortgage loans will be reduced  or we will experience a net loss on those sales 
in addition  we currently do not hedge the interest rate exposure related to our auto loan approvals 
approved auto loan applicants are provided a guaranteed rate for up to a day period 
based upon a variety of factors  we determined that the cost to hedge the potential interest rate risk was not proportional to the benefit derived 
to the extent that we experienced dramatic increases in short term generally two year term interest rates  it is possible that we could experience a net loss on those loan approvals 
uncertainty with respect to the time it takes to close mortgage loans can lead to unpredictable revenue and profitability the time between the date an application for a mortgage loan is received from a customer and the date the loan closes can be lengthy and unpredictable 
the loan application and approval process is often delayed due to factors over which we have little or no control  including the timing of the customer s decision to commit to an available interest rate  the close of escrow date for purchase loans  the timeliness of appraisals and the adequacy of the customer s own disclosure documentation 
purchase mortgage loans generally take longer to close than refinance loans as they are tied to the close of the property sale escrow date 
this uncertain timetable can have a direct impact on our revenue and profitability for any given period 
we may expend substantial funds and management resources supporting the loan completion process and never generate revenue from closed loans 
therefore  our results of operations for a particular period may be adversely affected if the mortgage loans applied for during that period do not close in a timely manner or at all 
we have recently experienced significant growth in our business  and if we are unable to manage this growth  our business will be adversely affected over the past two years we have experienced significant growth  which has placed a strain on our resources and will continue to do so in the future 
our failure to manage this growth effectively could adversely affect our business 
we may not be successful in managing or expanding our operations or maintaining adequate management  financial and operating systems and controls 
our headcount has grown substantially 
at december  and  we had and full time employees  respectively 
our future success is dependent upon increased acceptance of the internet by consumers and lenders as a medium for lending our success will depend in large part on widespread consumer acceptance of obtaining mortgage and auto loans online 
increased consumer use of the internet to provide for their lending needs is subject to uncertainty 
the development of an online market for mortgage and auto loans has only recently begun  is rapidly evolving and likely will be characterized by an increasing number of market entrants 
if consumer acceptance of the internet as a source for mortgage  home equity and auto loans  does not increase  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
a number of factors may inhibit internet usage by consumers  including privacy and security concerns regarding their personal information 
the adoption of online lending requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business  exchanging information and applying for credit by consumers that have historically relied upon traditional lending methods 
as a result  we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete effectively with traditional borrowing and lending methods 
the loss of our marketing agreements could adversely affect our business we rely on internet marketing agreements with other companies to direct a significant number of prospective customers to our website 
in the aggregate  approximately  and of our mortgage  home equity and auto loan applications  respectively  were derived from the websites of our online marketing agreements during the year ended december  our marketing agreements are typically short term  less than one year in length  and most can be terminated for any reason upon to days prior written notice 
we cannot assure you that any or all of these agreements will not be terminated or will be renewed or extended past their current expiration dates 
if a number of our significant marketing agreements were to be terminated or were to lapse without extension  we could lose a considerable number of loan applications and our business could be adversely affected 
the termination of one or more of our mortgage funding sources would adversely affect our business we depend on gmac bank  formerly ge capital mortgage services  inc gmac bank  to finance our self funded mortgage loan activities through the warehouse credit facility they provide 
we also depend on greenwich capital financial products  inc greenwich capital to finance portions of our mortgage loan inventory pending ultimate sale to mortgage loan purchasers 
if either of these warehouse credit facilities becomes unavailable  our business would be adversely affected 
under our agreements with each of these lenders  we make extensive representations  warranties and various operating and financial covenants 
a material breach of these representations  warranties or covenants on either or both lines could result in the termination of our agreements and an obligation to repay all amounts outstanding at the time of termination 
in the past  we have had to obtain waivers from our warehouse lenders as a result of our failure to comply with covenants regarding the issuance of capital stock  excess asset purchases and the breach of financial ratios 
our agreement with greenwich capital expires in march and our agreement with gmac bank expires in september upon expiration of these agreements management believes it will either renew its existing warehouse credit facilities or obtain sufficient additional credit facilities 
however  we cannot assure you that these agreements will be renewed or extended past their current expiration dates  and additional sources of funding for our mortgage loans may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
the termination of our auto line of credit would adversely affect our business we have obtained a line of credit from merrill lynch mortgage capital inc to finance the funding of our auto loans  and this is our sole facility for auto loan fundings 
if this credit facility becomes unavailable  our business could be adversely affected 
under our line of credit agreement  we make extensive representations  warranties and various operating and financial covenants 
a material breach of these representations  warranties or covenants could result in the termination of the facility and an obligation to repay all amounts outstanding at the time of termination 
in the past we have had to obtain waivers from our previous auto line of credit provider bank one  na as a result of our failure to comply with a covenant regarding a debt to tangible net worth ratio 
our line of credit with merrill lynch mortgage capital inc expires june  upon expiration  management believes it will either renew its existing line or obtain sufficient additional lines 
however  we cannot assure you that this agreement will be renewed or extended past its current expiration date  and additional sources of funding for our auto loans may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
we are primarily dependent on one loan purchaser for all of our home equity business in  the majority of our home equity loans were purchased by wells fargo bank pursuant to a home equity loan line purchase agreement 
if wells fargo bank is unable or unwilling to purchase our home equity loans  we may experience delays in our ability to accept or process home equity loan applications until we are able to secure new sources of loan purchasers 
sufficient additional sources of loan purchasers for our home equity loans may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
we are dependent on a limited number of auto loan purchasers for our auto loan business we currently sell the majority of our sub prime auto loans to three auto loan purchasers  household international  roadloans and transouth 
in addition  we currently sell all of our prime auto loans to a qualified special purpose entity qspe 
the qspe is dependent on merrill lynch to provide the necessary financing to continue purchasing loans from us 
if any of the current auto loan purchasers are unable or unwilling to purchase our auto loans  we may experience delays in our ability to accept or process auto loan applications 
we depend on the timely and competent services of various companies involved in the mortgage process  if these companies fail to timely and competently deliver these services  our business and reputation will be directly and adversely affected we rely on other companies to perform services related to the loan underwriting process  including appraisals  credit reporting and title searches 
any interruptions or delays in the provision of these services may cause delays in the processing and closing of loans for our customers 
if we are unsuccessful in managing the timely delivery of these services we will likely experience increased customer dissatisfaction and our business and reputation could be adversely affected 
the loss of our relationship with any of our significant providers of automated underwriting would have an adverse effect on our business we depend on automated underwriting and other services offered by government sponsored and other mortgage investors  including fannie mae and freddie mac agencies  to help ensure that our mortgage services can be offered efficiently and on a timely basis 
we currently have an agreement with the agencies that authorizes our use of their automated underwriting services and enables us to sell qualified first mortgages to these agencies 
we cannot assure you that we will remain in good standing with the agencies or that the agencies will not terminate our relationship 
we expect to continue to process a significant portion of our conforming mortgage loans using the agencies systems 
our agreement with the agencies can be terminated by either party 
the termination of our agreements with the agencies would adversely affect our business by reducing our ability to streamline the mortgage origination process 
any outages  delays or other difficulties experienced by the internet service providers  online service providers or other website operators on which our users depend could adversely affect our business our website has in the past and may in the future experience slower response times or decreased traffic for a variety of reasons 
in addition  our users depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other website operators for access to our websites 
many internet users have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
additionally  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support continued growth in its use 
any of these problems could adversely affect our business 
our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to safeguard the security and privacy of our customers financial data internet usage could decline if any well publicized compromise of security occurred 
we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches that occur 
we also retain on our premises personal financial documents that we receive from prospective borrowers in connection with their loan applications 
these documents are highly sensitive and if a third party were to misappropriate our customers personal information  customers could possibly bring legal claims against us 
we cannot assure you that our privacy policy will be deemed sufficient by our prospective customers or compliant with any federal or state laws governing privacy  which may be adopted in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate movements significantly impact our volume of closed loans and represent the primary component of market risk to us 
in a higher interest rate environment  consumer demand for mortgage loans  particularly refinancing of existing mortgages  declines 
interest rate movements affect the interest income earned on loans held for sale  interest expense on the warehouse lines payable  the value of mortgage loans held for sale and ultimately the gain on sale of mortgage loans 
we attempt to minimize the interest rate risk associated with the time lag between when loans are rate locked and when they are committed for sale or exchanged in the secondary market  through our hedging activities 
individual mortgage loan risks are aggregated by loan type and stage in the pipeline  and are then matched  based on duration  with the appropriate hedging instrument  thus mitigating basis risk until closing and delivery 
we currently hedge our mortgage pipeline through mandatory forward sales of fannie mae mortgage backed securities and both mandatory and non mandatory forward loan sale agreements with the ultimate investor 
we determine which alternative provides the best execution in the secondary market 
in addition  we do not believe our net interest income would be materially affected as a result of concurrent changes in long term and short term interest rates due to the short duration of time loans are held on the balance sheet prior to being sold typically under thirty days 
we believe that we have implemented a cost effective hedging program to provide a high level of protection against changes in the market value of rate lock commitments 
however  an effective strategy is complex and no hedging strategy can completely insulate the company against such changes
