item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and risk factors that may affect future results please see part i  item above for an important discussion about forward looking statements and risk factors that may affect future results 
overview vitalworks inc is a leading provider of information management technology and services targeted to healthcare practices and organizations throughout the united states 
we provide it based solutions for general medical practices and have specialty specific products and services for practices such as radiology  anesthesiology  ophthalmology  emergency medicine  plastic surgery  and dermatology 
we also offer enterprise level systems designed for large physician groups and networks 
our range of software solutions  which include workflow features related to patient encounters  automate the administrative  financial  and clinical information management functions for physicians and other healthcare providers 
we provide our clients with ongoing software support  implementation  training  electronic data interchange  or edi  services for patient billing and claims processing  and a variety of web based services 
software license fees and system revenues are derived from the sale of software product licenses and computer hardware 
maintenance and services revenues come from providing ongoing product support  implementation  training and transaction processing services 
approximately of our total revenues are of a recurring nature 
we market our products and services primarily to three types of physician practices ambulatory imaging centers and radiology practices  as well as anesthesiology practices  large general and emergency medicine practices  such as physician networks  clinics and management service organizations that include ten or more doctors  and small group practices of fewer than ten doctors that serve a local community  including ophthalmology  dermatology and general medicine practices 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from the radiology anesthesiology market and from each of our other markets 
approximately an equal amount of revenues was derived from each of these three markets in revenues from the small group market are skewed more toward maintenance and services 
results of operations revenues year ended december  change change dollars in thousands maintenance and services    percentage of total revenues software licenses and system sales    percentage of total revenues we recognize software license revenues and system computer hardware sales upon execution of the sales contract and delivery of the software off the shelf application software and or hardware 
in all cases  however  the fee must be fixed or determinable  collection of any related receivable must be considered probable  and no significant post contract obligations of ours shall be remaining 
otherwise  we defer the sale until all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
maintenance fees for routine client support and unspecified product updates are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance arrangement 
training  implementation and edi services revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
most of our sales and licensing contracts involve multiple elements  in which case  we allocate the total value of the customer arrangement to each element based on the relative fair values of the respective elements 
the residual method is used to determine revenue recognition with respect to a multiple element arrangement when specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements eg  implementation  training and maintenance services  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of the contract eg  computer software or hardware 
the fair value of an element is determined by the average price charged when that element is sold separately eg  the fair value of maintenance services is determined based on the average renewal price charged to clients for continued maintenance 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered element s of an arrangement  the total value of the customer arrangement is deferred until the undelivered element s is delivered or until objective evidence of fair value is established 
in our contracts and arrangements with our customers  we generally do not include acceptance provisions  which would give the customer the right to accept or reject the product after we ship it 
however  if an acceptance provision is included  revenue is recognized upon the customer s acceptance of the product  which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we provide allowances for estimated future returns and discounts recorded as contra revenue  as well as bad debts  upon recognition of revenues 
recognition of revenues in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments that affect the timing and amount of reported revenues 
if we were to adopt new  or change our current  business practices in response to a preference from the market or otherwise  then our revenue recognition practices may be subject to significant change to comply with the requisite accounting principles 
for example  subscription type arrangements and practices strictly for software services and support would result in the recognition of revenues ratably over the term of the arrangement 
excluding edi services revenues of million recognized in in connection with the settlement of a contract dispute with an edi supplier  maintenance and services revenues in increased million 
the increase is primarily attributable to i an increase in training and implementation services revenues of million  corresponding to the favorable trend in sales of software licenses and systems  and ii additional edi revenues  net of customer attrition  of approximately million  which reflect the conversion of a number of customer accounts to direct billing by us for printing services performed by certain third parties that  in the first nine months of  had been billed directly by the printing vendors 
our revised agreements with these printers now call for us to bill our physician practices directly for printing services and  in turn  remit a specified dollar amount per page to the printer 
accordingly  based on the amended agreements  we recognize of our direct billings as revenue  compared to an amount that previously was net of the printers fees 
moreover  the increases were partly offset by i the loss of revenues totaling million earned in under agreements to promote third party product and services  which agreements were terminated in  and ii a 
million decline in maintenance revenues related to customer attrition 
the increase in maintenance and services revenues in is mainly attributable to i edi services revenues of million recognized in july in connection with the contract settlement referred to above  ii an increase in maintenance fees of approximately 
million resulting from price increases that took effect primarily in the second half of the year  and iii additional edi revenues of approximately million that arose primarily in the fourth quarter from the conversion of a number of customer accounts to direct billing by us for printing services performed by certain third parties that in prior periods had been billed directly by the printing vendors 
software license and system revenues rose in primarily as a result of an increase in the number of licenses and systems sold unit volume versus  for example  price increases 
this increase was led by software sales made primarily to ambulatory imaging centers and radiology practices 
we operate with a minimal amount of software licensing and system sales backlog 
therefore  quarterly and annual revenues and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of the signing of license agreements and product deliveries during each quarter 
a significant portion of our quarterly sales of software product licenses and computer hardware is concluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter  generally with a concentration of our quarterly revenues earned in the final ten business days of that month 
also  our projections for revenues and operating results include significant sales of new product and service offerings  including our new radiology information system  or ris  and sales and services related to the implementation of hipaa  which may not be realized 
due to these and other factors  our revenues and operating results are very difficult to forecast 
as a result  comparison of our period to period financial performance is not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 
in  software license and system revenues rose slightly primarily due to an increase in the number of licenses and systems sold 
the unit volume increase was realized in the last three quarters of the year 
in the first quarter  we experienced a decline in the number of licenses and systems sold  which was the near term result of management s reorganization and redeployment of the sales force and redirection of our marketing focus that was initiated in fiscal cost of revenues year ended december  change change dollars in thousands maintenance and services    percentage of maintenance and services revenues software licenses and system sales    percentage of software licenses and system sales cost of maintenance and services revenues consists primarily of the cost of edi claims processing  outsourced hardware maintenance and billing and statement printing services  and postage 
the increase in principally reflects additional costs of edi services incurred in connection with the conversion of a number of customers to direct billing for printing services  as discussed above regarding edi revenues 
in addition  in we recovered certain edi processing costs and recognized a credit of 
million in connection with the contract settlement referred to above 
the decrease in the cost of maintenance and services revenues in primarily reflects the recovery of certain edi processing costs of 
million referred to above  a decline in hardware maintenance costs of approximately 
million  and reductions in the per transaction cost of providing patient statement  invoicing and claims processing services 
the decreases were partially offset by additional costs of edi services of approximately 
million incurred primarily in the fourth quarter in connection with the conversion of a number of customers to direct billing by us for printing services  as discussed above regarding edi revenues 
cost of software license and system revenues consists primarily of costs incurred to purchase computer hardware  third party software and other items for resale in connection with sales of new systems and software and  in  amortization of product development costs 
the increase in is mainly attributable to million in additional costs associated with an increase in the number of computer hardware units sold  and amortization of product development costs of 
million 
in  the decrease in the cost of software licenses and system revenues principally reflects a decline in the number of computer hardware units sold which generally yield lower margins compared to software sales 
operating expenses year ended december  change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative    percentage of total revenues research and development    percentage of total revenues depreciation and amortization    percentage of total revenues selling  general and administrative expenses include fixed and variable compensation and benefits of all personnel other than research and development personnel  facilities  travel  communications  bad debt  legal  marketing  insurance and other administrative expenses 
the decreases in both and are related to the savings that resulted from a major restructuring plan that we initiated in august we closed offices  the last five of which were closed in march and april  and our employee base average was reduced to for  from for and for the decrease in also reflects declines in legal fees of million  bad debt expense of 
million and contract labor costs of 
million 
the increase in research and development expenses in is mainly attributable to additional personnel costs and third party software developer fees associated with our expanded product research and development activities 
in and  we capitalized million or of total research and development expenditures and million or of total research and development expenditures of third party programmer fees  respectively  in conformity with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
the amounts capitalized relate to our development of web based applications  including a radiology information system  or ris  which is a workflow solution for medical imaging centers 
we amortize capitalized software development costs over the estimated economic life of the products 
depending on the nature and success of the product  we generally expect to amortize these deferred costs over a three to five year period 
amortization commences when the product is made commercially available 
two of the five products under development were made commercially available in we expect the remaining products to become commercially available in the decrease in research and development expenses in reflects the reduction in staff that commenced in august as part of the restructuring plan 
in and  depreciation and amortization expense consisted mainly of million and million of goodwill amortization  respectively 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in is due primarily to the cessation of goodwill amortization in conformity with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement  which provides that  upon adoption  we shall no longer amortize our goodwill assets 
rather  we are required to test these assets for impairment of value on at least an annual basis 
pursuant to statement  we discontinued amortizing goodwill on january  the adoption of statement has not had a negative impact on our financial statements 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in pertains to the closing of office facilities in connection with the restructuring plan 
loss on headquarters building held for sale 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million relating to our former headquarters building in atlanta 
we sold the building in august for proceeds of million  after closing costs 
a portion of the proceeds from the sale was used to repay the million mortgage loan on the building 
approximately 
million of the proceeds is being held in escrow to partially guarantee to the new owner the monetary performance of practiceworks  inc  a tenant of the building  through december under their lease agreement 
we spun off practiceworks in march in connection with the sale  we entered into a market rate lease with the new owner of the building ending december for approximately  square feet of office space  or less than of the building 
in  we recognized a gain of 
million from the sale of the building included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the amount held in escrow has been deferred and may be recognized in impairment charges credits and other nonrecurring costs 
in the june and september quarters  we received final payments from three former directors satisfying their outstanding loans from us  including interest 
consequently  we recorded a credit of million  reflecting a complete reversal of the allowance for loan losses established in march in  we recognized impairment charges and incurred other nonrecurring costs of million 
these costs and expenses included the million provision for loan losses relating to the notes receivable from former directors  
million for unused equity financing paid in  
million of executive severance for separation benefits paid to our former chairman pursuant to the terms of a mutual separation agreement and a pre existing employment agreement  and retention bonuses of 
million for terminated employees 
as of march   management determined that collection was doubtful with respect to approximately million of the outstanding balance of the director loans and  accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance and ceased accruing interest on the loans 
in  concurrent with the restructuring plan  we recognized impairment charges and incurred other nonrecurring costs of million consisting of i million relating to fixed assets that were abandoned due to the closing of facilities  ii million to write down computer hardware held for resale to its estimated net realizable value based on a planned bulk lot disposal as a result of our decision to discontinue selling hardware and hardware support in certain of our business lines  iii million for compensation and other termination benefits  iv 
million for other asset write downs  and v 
million for professional services and other related costs 
restructuring costs credits 
on august   we announced our intention to restructure our operations through a plan of employee reductions and consolidation of office facilities 
since then  we closed facilities and terminated approximately employees 
the offices that were closed are subject to operating leases that expire at various dates through accordingly  in we incurred restructuring charges of million primarily associated with employee severance and other termination benefits  and facility closure costs 
in  we recorded 
million resulting from credits for changes in accounting estimates relating to facility closure and employee severance costs incurred in in  we recognized an additional credit of 
million reflecting a savings in connection with the early termination of an office lease for a facility closed in march as part of the restructuring 
interest income expense year ended december  change change dollars in thousands interest income  interest expense    the increase in interest income in reflects interest of million not previously recognized on the notes receivable from former directors 
in the june and september quarters  we received final payments from the former directors satisfying their outstanding loans  including interest 
interest expense consists primarily of interest costs incurred in connection with our outstanding term loan and real estate mortgage loans 
as of august  the mortgage loans have been repaid in full 
the decrease in interest expense in is due to a decline in both the outstanding principal balances and associated interest rates under our credit agreement 
income taxes for  we recorded an income tax provision of 
million 
no income tax provision or benefit was recognized in due to the significant loss generated in  we recognized an income tax benefit of million 
management has assessed the realizable value of our deferred tax assets of million and determined that a valuation allowance of million was necessary as of december  to  along with deferred tax liabilities of million  reduce the net deferred tax asset to million  an amount which we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in reaching this conclusion  management noted that internal projections indicate that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets within three to four years 
our effective income tax rate was less than for and is expected to remain at less than for due primarily to utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
loss from discontinued operations discontinued operations represent the results of practiceworks  inc  a provider of practice management software for dental and oral surgery practices  through march  on that date  we distributed of the common stock of practiceworks to our stockholders 
for the period january  to march  and for the year ended december   our net loss from discontinued operations was million and million  respectively 
for further details regarding the distribution of shares of practiceworks to our stockholders  see note c of the accompanying financial statements 
net income loss as a result of the above factors  our operating results for increased to net income of million from a net loss of million in and a net loss of million in to date  the overall impact of inflation on us has not been material 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our business through positive cash flows from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock and long term borrowings 
for  and  we generated positive cash flows from operations of million  million and million  respectively 
days sales outstanding calculated as accounts receivable  net of allowances  divided by annual revenues multiplied by days for was days  up from days for and down from days for looking forward  assuming license and systems sales increase  we would expect our days sales outstanding to range from to days 
cash provided by investing activities amounted to million for this total includes net proceeds of million from the sale of office buildings and 
million related to the spin off of practiceworks  offset partially by million used for software development costs and 
million used primarily for purchases of computer equipment and software 
financing activities for provided cash of million  consisting of proceeds of million received in connection with a new four year credit agreement  million of loan payments received from former directors  and million of payments received in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees  partly offset by million of principal payments of long term debt and million of cash used to repurchase our common stock 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million of total long term debt 
cash equivalents are comprised primarily of investment grade commercial paper  time deposits  and us federal  state and political subdivision obligations with varying terms of three months or less 
in march  we entered into a new four year credit agreement with foothill capital corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of wells fargo company 
the new agreement included a term loan of million at an interest rate of prime plus  and a mortgage loan of million 
we repaid the mortgage loan in august in connection with the sale of our atlanta property 
subject to achieving certain specified earnings targets  the margin by which our interest rate on the term loan exceeds prime may be reduced by as much as over the life of the loan 
interest is payable monthly in arrears 
principal is payable over the life of the agreement  including a balloon payment in march should we decide to prepay the term loan in full prior to year four  we would incur a prepayment fee equal to in year two and in year three of the then outstanding principal balance of the term loan 
the prepayment fee may be reduced should the loan be prepaid in connection with a change of control of vitalworks 
the loans  which are collateralized by substantially all of our assets and intellectual property rights  subject us to certain restrictive covenants  including i the required maintenance of minimum levels of recurring revenues and earnings  as defined  ii an annual limit on the amount of capital expenditures  and iii the prohibition of dividend payments to shareholders 
the following table summarizes  as of december   the general timing of future payments under our outstanding loan agreement and under lease agreements that include noncancellable terms 
payments due by period totals thereafter in thousands long term debt     operating leases 
      capital leases in may  we entered into a five year agreement with a third party provider of edi services for patient claims processing 
for the first year of the agreement  we are committed to pay 
million for processing services 
thereafter  the annual services fee will range from 
million to 
million based on our volume usage in the last month of the preceding year 
in connection with our employee savings plan  we have committed  for the plan year  to contribute to the plan 
our matching contribution  estimated to be approximately 
million  will be made half in cash and half in shares of our common stock 
in october  we expanded our august agreement with national data corporation  or ndc  for outsourcing much of our patient statement and invoice printing work 
we will continue  for a fee  to provide printing services for our physicians under the subcontracting arrangement with ndc 
the amended arrangement  which extends for a period of up to seven and a half years  provides for  among other things  the attainment of certain quarterly transaction processing volume levels during the term 
in exchange  we received million in cash in connection with the august agreement  we received million in  which represent unearned discounts see accompanying balance sheet that are recognized as an offset to cost of maintenance and services revenues as the minimum volume commitments are fulfilled 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million for  including software development costs of approximately million 
we intend to review potential strategic acquisitions and other business alliances 
in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock from time to time 
the timing and amount of any shares repurchased are determined by management based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
repurchased shares are available for use in connection with stock plans and for other corporate purposes 
the repurchase program is funded using our existing cash resources 
as of march   we repurchased  shares of our common stock under the program for an aggregate cost of million 
from time to time  in the normal course of business  various claims are made against us 
except for proceedings described below  there are no material proceedings to which we are a party  and management is unaware of any material contemplated actions against us 
on february   a purported class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the district of connecticut against vitalworks inc and three of our executive officers 
the action was brought by plaintiff bernard frazier  on behalf of purchasers of our securities between april  and october  the class period 
the complaint alleges  among other things  violations of section b of the securities exchange act of  rule b promulgated thereunder and breach of fiduciary duties 
the complaint alleges that the defendants made misleading statements and omissions regarding our business and operations  principally in press releases and public conference calls in april and july  which allegedly had the effect of artificially inflating the market price of our common stock during the class period  and that six of our officers  including the defendant officers  sold shares of our common stock during the class period 
the plaintiff seeks recovery of an unstated amount of compensatory damages  attorneys fees and costs 
we understand that an additional lawsuit or lawsuits containing substantially similar causes of action as the above referenced matter has been filed against us  although we have not yet been served with any complaint 
on april   a lawsuit styled david and susan jones v 
infocure corporation now known as vitalworks inc  et al  was filed in boone county superior court in indiana 
the defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of indiana 
the complaint alleges state securities law violations  breach of contract  and fraud claims against the defendants 
the complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought by plaintiffs  but seeks rescission of a transaction that the plaintiffs value at million  as well as punitive damages and reimbursement for the plaintiffs attorneys fees and associated costs and expenses of the lawsuit 
in a decision from the court dated october   the plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction to preserve their remedy of rescission was denied  part of their complaint was dismissed and the case was transferred to the northern district court of georgia 
on october   the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the th circuit court of appeals 
on november   the th circuit court affirmed the denial of the preliminary injunction and dismissed the remainder of the appeal 
the case is now pending in the northern district court of georgia and the plaintiffs have obtained leave of the court to file an amended complaint 
while management believes that we have meritorious defenses in each of the foregoing matters and we intend to pursue our positions vigorously  litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties 
thus  the outcome of these matters is uncertain and could be adverse to us 
however  even if the outcome of these cases is adverse  we do not believe that the outcome of these cases  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
however  depending on the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution s of the contingencies  it is possible that our future results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected in a particular reporting period s 
we were named as a defendant as successor to cdl healthcare systems  inc cdl  a company acquired by us in december  in a complaint filed in the circuit court of the eleventh judicial circuit in dade county  florida on february  by sonia abutog  individually  angelo abutog  individually  and sonia and angelo abutog  as parents and next best friends to aaron abutog  a minor 
gary weiner  former president of cdl  and his daughter  elisha weiner  were also named as defendants 
plaintiffs alleged that they were injured at a time  prior to the merger between us and cdl  when a motor vehicle operated by elisha weiner collided with plaintiff sonia abutog  a pedestrian 
the plaintiff contended that she and her unborn child suffered severe personal injuries as a result of the accident and sought to recover damages in an unspecified amount in excess of  plus interest and costs 
our motion for final summary judgment dismissing the action against us was granted by order of the court dated july  the plaintiffs did not file a notice of appeal of this decision and the time to do so has expired 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances  together with the funds we expect to generate from our operations  will be sufficient to finance our business for the next twelve months  including the repurchase  as the case may be see discussion above regarding our stock repurchase program  of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which we believe have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for future returns  discounts and bad debts  tangible and intangible assets  deferred costs  income taxes  restructurings  commitments  contingencies  claims and litigation 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  our actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize software license revenues and system computer hardware sales upon execution of the sales contract and delivery of the software off the shelf application software and or hardware 
in all cases  however  the fee must be fixed or determinable  collection of any related receivable must be considered probable  and no significant post contract obligations of ours shall be remaining 
otherwise  we defer the sale until all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
maintenance fees for routine client support and unspecified product updates are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance arrangement 
training  implementation and edi services revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
most of our sales and licensing contracts involve multiple elements  in which case  we allocate the total value of the customer arrangement to each element based on the relative fair values of the respective elements 
the residual method is used to determine revenue recognition with respect to a multiple element arrangement when specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements eg  implementation  training and maintenance services  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of the contract eg  computer software or hardware 
the fair value of an element is determined by the average price charged when that element is sold separately eg  the fair value of maintenance services is determined based on the average renewal price charged to clients for continued maintenance 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered element s of an arrangement  the total value of the customer arrangement is deferred until the undelivered element s is delivered or until objective evidence of fair value is established 
in our contracts and arrangements with our customers  we generally do not include acceptance provisions  which would give the customer the right to accept or reject the product after we ship it 
however  if an acceptance provision is included  revenue is recognized upon the customer s acceptance of the product  which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we provide allowances for estimated future returns and discounts recorded as contra revenue  as well as bad debts  upon recognition of revenues 
recognition of revenues in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments that affect the timing and amount of reported revenues 
accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms carried at their face value  less allowances for estimated future returns and discounts  as well as bad debts 
we evaluate the carrying amount of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and establish a valuation allowance based on a number of factors  including specific customer circumstances  historical rate of write offs and the past due status of the accounts 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  the allowance is reviewed and analyzed for adequacy and is often adjusted based on the findings 
the allowance is increased through a reduction of revenues  an increase in bad debt expense and or recovery of amounts previously written off 
the allowance is reduced by write offs of amounts deemed uncollectible and adjustments to revenue and or bad debt expense  if any  based on management s determination as to the adequacy of the recorded allowance 
goodwill assets and business combinations 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired and accounted for as purchase transactions 
in  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement provides that  upon adoption  we shall no longer amortize our goodwill assets 
rather  we are required to test our goodwill for impairment of value on at least an annual basis 
pursuant to statement  we discontinued amortizing goodwill on january  the adoption of statement has not had a negative impact on our financial statements 
excluding goodwill amortization of million and million for the years ended december  and  our net loss would have been million  or per share  and million  or per share  respectively  compared to net income of million  or 
per diluted share  for also in  the fasb issued statement  business combinations 
statement requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations 
statement also requires that we recognize acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill if the acquired intangible assets meet certain criteria 
statement applies to all business combinations initiated after june  our business combinations were completed prior to and were accounted for using both the pooling of interests and purchase methods 
the pooling of interests method does not result in the recognition of acquired goodwill or other intangible assets 
as a result  the adoption of statements and did not affect the results of past transactions accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
however  all future business combinations would be accounted for under the purchase method  which may result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  some of which would be recognized through operations  either by amortization or impairment charges  in the future 
product development costs 
we begin capitalizing product development costs  exclusively third party programmer fees  only after establishing commercial and technical viability 
annual amortization of these costs represents the greater of the amount computed using i the ratio that current gross revenues for the product s bear to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues of the product s  or ii the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product s  generally  depending on the nature and success of the product  such deferred costs are amortized over a three to five year period 
amortization commences when the product is made commercially available 
two of the five products under development were made commercially available in stock based compensation 
statement  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by statement  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we account for stock option grants and stock awards  based on their intrinsic value  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense is only recognized if the exercise price of the employee stock option is less than the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
the weighted average estimated grant date fair value  as defined by statement  of options granted in  and was  and  respectively  as calculated using the black scholes option valuation model 
we price our stock options at fair market value on the date of grant  and therefore  under opinion  no compensation expense is recognized for stock options granted 
the following table illustrates the effect on income loss from continuing operations and the related earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of statement  as amended  to stock based employee compensation in thousands  except per share data year ended december  income loss from continuing operations  as reported    less total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards  net of related tax effects    pro forma income loss from continuing operations    earnings loss per share continuing operations basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma the fair value of our employee stock options was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions year ended december  risk free interest rate expected dividend yield expected stock price volatility weighted average expected life in years the black scholes option valuation model was not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
instead  this model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  which differ significantly from our stock option awards 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
income taxes 
we provide for taxes based on current taxable income  and the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax carrying values of our assets and liabilities deferred income taxes 
quarterly  management assesses the realizable value of deferred tax assets based on  among other things  estimates of future taxable income  and adjusts the related valuation allowance as necessary 
earnings per share 
the following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings loss per share eps in thousands  except per share data year ended december  numerator income loss continuing operations    discontinued operations   denominator basic eps weighted average shares    effect of dilutive securities  stock option and warrant rights  diluted eps adjusted weighted average shares and assumed conversions    basic eps continuing operations discontinued operations diluted eps continuing operations discontinued operations because their effect would be antidilutive  stock option and warrant rights for up to million common shares with exercise prices ranging from to per share were excluded from the diluted eps calculation for for the same reason  all options and warrants were excluded from the diluted calculation for years and recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by statement include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  facility closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
statement is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in april  the fasb issued statement  rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
for most companies  statement will require gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under statement extraordinary treatment will be required for certain extinguishments as provided in accounting principles board opinion no 
statement also amends statement for certain sales leaseback and sublease accounting

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk consists of fluctuations in the prime rate of interest announced from time to time by wells fargo bank na approximately million of our outstanding debt at december  related to long term indebtedness under our credit agreement with foothill capital corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of wells fargo company 
we expect interest on the outstanding balance of the loan to be charged based on a variable rate related to the prime rate 
thus  our interest expense is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in the prime rate of interest 
the effect of a hypothetical one hundred basis point increase across all maturities of variable rate debt would result in an annual decrease of approximately 
million in pre tax operating results assuming no further changes in the amount of our borrowings subject to variable rate interest from amounts outstanding at december  we do not hold derivative securities and have not entered into contracts embedded with derivative instruments  such as foreign currency and interest rate swaps  options  forwards  futures  collars  and warrants  either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes
