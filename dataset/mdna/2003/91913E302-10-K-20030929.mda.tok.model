item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in particular part i  item business additional factors that may affect future results  for a detailed description of these significant risks  uncertainties and other factors 
company overview valentis  inc valentis is converting biologic discoveries into innovative products 
the company s lead product that is currently in human testing is the del angiogenesis gene formulated with one of the company s proprietary polymer delivery systems 
the company is developing its other technologies  the geneswitch and dna vaccine delivery technologies  through partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the merger of megabios corp 
and genemedicine  inc in march formed valentis inc  a delaware corporation 
in august  valentis acquired uk based polymasc pharmaceuticals plc 
valentis is located in burlingame  california  which is the company s headquarters  as well as the center for manufacturing  and clinical and preclinical development 
previously  valentis had locations in the woodlands  texas and london  england 
in april  the company announced that it would consolidate all of its pegylation research activities from its facilities in london  england into its preclinical center in the woodlands  texas 
the consolidation was substantially completed in september in january and october  valentis implemented restructuring plans to better align the company s cost structure with current market conditions 
these plans significantly reduced its preclinical product development efforts and suspended its clinical programs in oncology in an effort to lower future expenditures and conserve cash 
a total of positions  primarily in preclinical  clinical and manufacturing research and development  and associated general and administrative staff  were eliminated as a result of the restructurings 
as a result of its restructurings  the company exited the woodlands facility  which housed the company s preclinical development  in june in september  the company entered into a lease termination agreement with the landlord of the woodlands facility 
pursuant to the lease termination agreement  the woodlands facility lease was terminated on september  also  as a result of its restructurings  the company will exit  square feet of the burlingame facility in october pursuant to a lease termination agreement with the landlord of the burlingame facility  executed in july technologies valentis technologies provide novel ways to achieve production of therapeutic proteins in their most natural and active forms at specific sites within the body 
our products  genes formulated with synthetic delivery systems  are administered to specific tissues where they enter targeted cells 
these cells then produce the therapeutic proteins or vaccine antigens 
the fidelity  specificity and duration of expression within the target cells may also be controlled by valentis proprietary gene regulation systems 
synthetic gene delivery systems valentis has developed synthetic gene delivery systems based on several classes of polymers and lipids 
our pinc polymeric  non condensing polymers are designed to provide efficient delivery to a variety of tissues  including muscle and solid tumors 
they provide for higher and more consistent levels of protein production 
valentis cationic lipid formulations provide efficient delivery after intravenous or intratumoral administration 
the ability of both delivery systems to enhance cellular distribution and uptake of genes in vivo has resulted in the production of therapeutic levels of proteins 
gene regulation systems valentis geneswitch technologies permit therapeutic protein production that is controlled via an orally administered drug 
products incorporating our geneswitch technology are delivered with a polymer delivery system and electroporation 
this results in controlled production of therapeutic proteins from muscle tissue for prolonged periods 
the geneswitch gene regulation system is available for licensing as a functional genomics research tool 
non exclusive licensees of the geneswitch system include glaxosmithkline  lexicon genetics  larnax gmbh  pfizer  schering ag  senomyx and wyeth ayerst laboratories the pharmaceutical division of american home products 
synthetic vaccine delivery systems valentis has developed synthetic vaccine delivery systems based on several classes of polymers 
our proprietary pinc polymer based delivery technologies for intramuscular administration provide for higher and more consistent levels of antigen production 
current good manufacturing practices manufacturing valentis has developed proprietary scalable processes for the manufacture of plasmid dna and gene based products 
through a strategy of using a contract manufacturing organization cmo for plasmid dna production of our products  we are able to produce material from lab to commercial scale using the same process 
most recently  cangene corporation has been our primary cmo 
in addition  in june  valentis entered into a new agreement that reinstates a license to dsm biologics dsm to use valentis manufacturing technology 
the terms of the original agreement between valentis and dsm  entered into in september   were modified to add a royalty to valentis in addition to the previously agreed upon profit sharing arrangement

research includes the development of animal models and assay systems  discovery of prototype gene delivery systems and evaluation and refinement of prototype gene delivery systems in in vitro and in vivo testing 
products del an angiogenic product for cardiovascular disease valentis most advanced clinical product is the del angiogenesis gene for vascular disease 
the company completed its phase i testing  and a phase ii trial in peripheral arterial disease is currently under way 
the analysis of the data of the phase i clinical trial demonstrated an absence of drug related severe adverse effects 
the data also showed improvements in efficacy endpoints that were affected by both the dose and the pattern of product administration 
the phase i trial requires the company to complete one year follow ups for all subjects 
the del protein is involved in embryonic growth and development of blood vessels 
it is a unique angiogenic factor that promotes vascular growth and inhibits endothelial cell death 
the del protein has a distinct mechanism of action from other angiogenic factors such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and fibroblast growth factor fgf families 
the del product is formulated using novel  proprietary technology 
by stimulating angiogenesis  del has demonstrated the potential to be effective in the treatment of a variety of vascular diseases including peripheral arterial disease pad and ischemic heart disease ihd 
in june  valentis announced that its del gene product elicited development of new blood vessels in studies of rabbits and mice 
a single administration of the del gene in muscle had similar effects on development of new blood vessels in rabbit and mouse models as a vegf 
gene used as a comparator in both studies 
acute toxicities observed with the vegf 
gene in dose response studies were not observed with the del gene at similar doses  suggesting that the del gene may have safety advantages over vegf 
in june  valentis initiated a phase i clinical trial for the del gene product for the treatment of pad 
the goal of this open label  multi center  dose escalation trial was to evaluate safety and to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the del gene product in patients with pad  where the patients suffer from a blockage of the blood vessels in their legs 
the secondary objective of the trial was to obtain preliminary efficacy data and evidence of angiogenic activity 
for pad  valentis del product is administered by intramuscular injection 
in the del pad phase i clinical trial  patients with pad were enrolled to determine product safety in humans 
the patients  divided into seven groups  received intra muscular doses of product ranging from to mg administered to a diseased leg 
the results of this trial allowed the company to choose a dose and dosing pattern for the phase ii safety and efficacy trial  which began in june in june  valentis presented data from its phase i clinical trial for the del gene product at a conference for the american society of gene therapy 
in the trial  there were no observed severe adverse events from the drug and del was well tolerated at all doses tested 
although the number of patients in each dose group was small  there appeared to be evidence of dose related product activity 
in july  valentis announced the initiation of a phase ii clinical trial of its del gene product 
the trial is randomized  double blind and placebo controlled 
one hundred patients with pad  specifically intermittent claudication  are being randomized to receive either the del product or placebo 
the trial is being conducted in seventeen centers in the united states 
enrollment is expected to be completed in the first quarter of and data are expected in the third quarter of eposwitch a hematology product suspended anemia resulting from insufficient or ineffective erythropoietin epo occurs in patients with end stage renal disease  cancer or other chronic diseases 
the eposwitch product is designed to produce epo from skeletal muscle when an oral drug is given 
the oral drug turns on the geneswitch gene regulation system and the resulting epo may increase hematocrit  thereby avoiding the need for transfusions or repeat intramuscular or intravenous administration of recombinant human epo  and thus improve symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath associated with anemia 
the eposwitch product is administered as an intramuscular injection followed by electroporation 
the use of electroporation increases the uptake of the gene into the muscle cells and results in a marked increase in protein production 
plasmids encoding epo and the geneswitch proteins have been administered to mice  rats  dogs and pigs 
when the oral drug was given  significant increases in epo and or hematocrit levels were observed 
expression of erythropoietin has been seen up to days after treatment 
these studies demonstrated that the level and duration of erythropoietin expression could be controlled using the eposwitch product 
due to a focusing of the company s resources on the clinical development of its del product  in october  valentis suspended active development of its eposwitch product 
eposwitch remains a product development candidate if a change in resources enables the company to resume this program in the future 
il a product for cancer suspended the company suspended clinical development of its cancer immunotherapy products following release of clinical data from the phase ii clinical trial of an il product 
consistent with these developments and a decision by roche not to initiate a phase iii clinical trial  the company s alliance with roche ended in accordance with terms of the agreement 
scientific and industry background gene based therapeutics is an approach to the treatment or prevention of certain diseases in which therapeutic genes are introduced into the body to cause the production of specific proteins needed to bring about a therapeutic effect 
for gene based therapeutics to be effective  the therapeutic gene must be delivered to  and transported across  the outer membrane of a targeted cell and into the nucleus where it can be expressed 
the expressed protein may remain within the cell for an intracellular effect  be transported to the cell membrane to exert a cell surface effect  or be secreted into the bloodstream to have a systemic effect 
most gene based therapeutics utilize a delivery system  or vector  into which the therapeutic gene is incorporated to facilitate its delivery to  uptake by and expression in  the target cell 
genes provide the instructions or code for the productions of proteins  which determine the nature and function of cells and tissues in all living organisms 
the study of genes and their function genomics provides the fundamental basis for understanding human health and disease and has led to the identification of many genes with potential therapeutic utility therapeutic genes 
the entire genetic content of an organism is known as its genome 
in humans  the genome is believed to contain approximately  genes 
these genes encode approximately  proteins 
proteins enable cells to carry out their normal biological functions 
the process by which an organism utilizes genetic instructions and produces proteins is known as gene expression 
the expression of a defective gene  or the defective expression of a normal gene  is responsible for certain disease conditions 
for example  the expression of a single defective gene is known to cause cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia  and the defective expression of multiple genes is believed to be involved in the progression of diseases such as cancer  diabetes  and cardiovascular and neurological diseases 
the worldwide effort to decipher the human genome and to understand the function of its constituent genes is yielding important insights into the roles that genes play in disease conditions  as well as how genes may be useful in the treatment of such diseases 
it is estimated that about of genes have a known function  many of which have been identified as potential therapeutic genes 
various companies and academic institutions are investing substantial financial and human resources to identify additional therapeutic genes  and valentis believes that this process will create future opportunities for gene therapies 
gene delivery approaches to date  a limiting factor in gene based therapeutics has been the lack of safe  effective gene delivery systems 
a number of gene delivery approaches are being developed  each of which has exhibited certain limitations 
these approaches may be categorized by their mode of administration as ex vivo outside the body or in vivo inside the body and by the nature of the gene delivery system viral or plasmid based synthetic 
the first clinical trials of potential gene therapeutics used ex vivo viral gene delivery 
ex vivo gene therapies involve procedures in which selected cells are removed from the patient  transduced with the therapeutic gene  expanded in number  cleansed of contaminants and then reintroduced into the same patient 
this lengthy and labor intensive process significantly differs from traditional pharmaceutical administration and may result in a complex  high cost procedure 
valentis is developing its pinc delivery technologies consisting of synthetic  non toxic  poloxamer delivery systems 
each product consists primarily of two components i a plasmid dna a circular segment of dna that contains a therapeutic gene and components that regulate its expression in the cell  and ii polymers  which are synthetic  non viral agents to facilitate the delivery of the plasmid dna into target cells following intramuscular administration 
this traditional mode of administration is familiar to physicians and may be more convenient and cost effective than ex vivo approaches 
valentis believes its proprietary gene delivery systems have advantages over other gene delivery systems 
dna formulated with our pinc formulations have been shown to produce high protein levels with decreased variability as compared to protein levels obtained after naked dna administration 
in addition  valentis pinc gene delivery systems can be handled and administered like traditional pharmaceuticals 
we have demonstrated that we can produce clinical grade plasmid dna and plasmid based dna formulations under controlled conditions  and we have developed proprietary manufacturing and production methods designed to be scaled to meet commercial requirements 
we have tested our gene delivery systems in hundreds of animal experiments and in clinical trials 
our pinc delivery systems should allow for repeat administration of our products for the treatment of chronic diseases  such as cardiovascular disease 
while the results of preclinical animal studies may not predict safety or efficacy in humans  when further clinical trials are conducted  valentis believes that our experience in research and development will enable us to accelerate future development of products  and thereby attract corporate partners 
we believe our proprietary pinc delivery system may have the following benefits therapeutically relevant gene expression valentis has developed plasmid dna and delivery formulations which  following administration to animals  produce therapeutically relevant protein levels 
valentis has demonstrated that the use of pinc gene delivery systems in muscle can lead to a significant increase in both the level and the consistency of proteins produced compared to the administration of plasmids formulated in saline  or naked dna 
ease of handling and administration  stability and scalable manufacturing methods valentis pinc gene delivery systems are designed to be handled and administered like traditional pharmaceuticals 
these gene delivery systems are also designed to be stable when refrigerated and are intended to be distributed like other pharmaceuticals 
improved safety profile valentis tested its pinc gene delivery systems in hundreds of preclinical studies and in clinical trials 
valentis believes that its pinc gene delivery systems will allow for repeat administration of gene products for the treatment of chronic diseases 
additional technologies valentis has shown that gene delivery systems containing cationic lipids combined with neutral lipids enhance the cellular uptake of plasmid based gene expression systems 
these lipid based gene delivery systems have been demonstrated to enhance the entry of genes into tumor cells after intratumoral administration  and to deliver genes to the endothelium and epithelium of the lung after intravenous administration and inhalation  respectively 
although the company is not actively pursuing their use internally  the technologies are being out licensed for development by corporate partners 
to control the level and duration of selected genes in transgenic animals and cell cultures  valentis researchers have developed the geneswitch gene regulation system 
the geneswitch technology may accelerate the throughput of genomics research because it has the unique ability to control gene expression via an orally administered drug  and to assist in the identification and characterization of the function of selected genes 
this gene expression regulatory system has been licensed to a number of corporate partners who are successfully developing the technology in a variety of applications 
corporate collaborations valentis is actively seeking collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
in entering corporate collaborations  valentis seeks license fees  funding for research and development  milestone payments and royalties on product sales in exchange for worldwide commercial licenses to specific gene therapeutics and access to our development expertise 
the del product is our lead candidate for such collaboration 
also available are our delivery and plasmid expression systems 
since  valentis has experience with corporate research and development collaborations including roche holdings ltd  boehringer ingelheim international gmbh  eli lilly company and glaxo wellcome plc 
currently the company has a manufacturing collaborative license agreement with dsm biologics 
dsm biologics dsm in september  valentis and dsm biologics formerly gist brocades bio intermediair announced the formation of a broad  strategic collaboration focused on the manufacture and supply of plasmid dna and formulated dna to the industry 
in may  qiagen nv joined the manufacturing alliance to perform marketing 
the goal of this alliance was to provide the emerging gene therapy and genetic vaccination industry with early access to reliable  accepted plasmid dna contract manufacturing services and to produce high quality  ultra pure material for plasmid based therapeutics on every scale  from preclinical toxicology studies to commercial products 
under the agreement  valentis licensed its proprietary manufacturing technology for use in dsm facilities in montreal  canada and groningen  the netherlands for license and milestone fees 
to date  valentis has earned  in milestone fees under the agreement 
in june  valentis completed an agreement with dsm biologics under which the license granted by valentis to dsm biologics for valentis plasmid dna manufacturing technology was affirmed on revised financial terms 
the agreement further resolved outstanding disputes between valentis and dsm biologics regarding prior plasmid dna manufacturing services performed by dsm biologics for valentis 
under the new agreement  the palliance plasmid dna contract manufacturing alliance that had included valentis  dsm biologics and qiagen gmbh is dissolved 
the new agreement reinstates the license to dsm biologics under the terms of the original agreement between valentis and dsm biologics  modified to add a royalty to valentis in addition to the previously agreed upon profit sharing arrangement 
in consideration for the license reinstatement  dsm biologics paid a million milestone payment 
the net amount of this milestone payment and approximately million of outstanding debt owed to dsm biologics by valentis  which had been accrued by valentis as of june   was received in cash during fiscal the company recorded an expense reversal of approximately million during fiscal for the remaining amount accrued by valentis as of june   which the company is no longer obligated to pay to dsm biologics as a result of the new agreement

patents and proprietary technologies patents and other proprietary rights are important to valentis business 
our policy is to file patent applications and protect inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business 
valentis also relies on trade secrets  know how  confidentiality agreements  continuing technology innovations and licensing opportunities to protect its technology and develop and maintain its competitive position 
to date  valentis has filed  or participated as a licensee in the filing of  numerous patent applications in the united states relating to our technology  as well as counterparts of certain of these applications in many foreign countries 
our failure to obtain patent protection or otherwise protect our proprietary technology or proposed products may have a material adverse effect on valentis competitive position and business prospects 
the patent application process takes several years and entails considerable expense 
there is no assurance that additional patents will issue from these applications or  if patents do issue  that the claims allowed will be sufficient to protect our technology 
valentis has numerous patents and patent applications worldwide covering its gene expression and delivery technology  and pegylation technology  as well as use patents for various therapeutic applications  and patents and patent applications on its manufacturing technology 
in addition to patents and patent applications filed and owned by valentis  we have exclusive rights under our licenses with baylor college of medicine  roche biosciences  university of pittsburgh and vanderbilt university to patents and patent applications worldwide 
valentis has licensed from roche biosciences rights under certain us and foreign patents claiming the use of dotma for in vivo gene delivery 
we have licensed from vanderbilt exclusive rights to patents and patent applications covering the use of cationic lipids for gene delivery by systemic administration or by inhalation 
in a separate license with vanderbilt  we have licensed rights to vanderbilt s interest in the patents covering the del l gene and protein 
valentis has licensed from baylor patent rights covering our geneswitch gene regulation technology  patent rights on the use of certain muscle specific gene expression  and patent rights covering gene delivery to the joint 
we have licensed from the university of pittsburgh patent rights to the use of mnsod for damage caused by radiation or chemotherapy 
a number of the biopharmaceuticals that valentis and its corporate partners are investigating or may use in its products are or may become patented by others 
as a result  valentis or its corporate partners may be required to obtain licenses to gene sequences  proteins  or other technology to which it currently has no proprietary rights in order to use or market such products 
in addition  some of the products based on our delivery systems may require the use of multiple proprietary technologies 
consequently  valentis or its corporate partners may be required to make cumulative royalty payments to several third parties 
such cumulative royalties could reduce amounts paid to valentis or be commercially prohibitive 
in connection with our efforts to obtain rights to gene sequences  proteins  or other proprietary technology  valentis may find it necessary to convey rights to its technology to others 
there can be no assurance that valentis or its corporate partners will be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if required licenses are not available to valentis  we may not be able to develop or market certain products 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms are often uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
furthermore  the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents is unpredictable 
valentis cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology that is the subject of such patent applications 
competitors may have filed applications for  or may have received  patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to compounds  products or processes that block or compete with those of valentis 
valentis is aware of patent applications filed and patents issued to third parties relating to genes  gene delivery technologies and gene therapeutics  and there can be no assurance that any patent applications or patents will not have a material adverse effect on products valentis or its corporate partners are developing or may seek to develop in the future 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against valentis with respect to its products or technology or other matters 
patent litigation is widespread in the biotechnology industry 
litigation may be necessary to defend against or assert claims of infringement  to enforce patents issued to valentis  to protect trade secrets or know how owned or licensed by valentis  or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of third parties 
although no third party has asserted that valentis is infringing such third party s patent rights or other intellectual property  there can be no assurance that litigation asserting such claims will not be initiated  that valentis would prevail in any such litigation or that valentis would be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms  if at all 
any such claims against valentis  with or without merit  as well as claims initiated by valentis against third parties  can be time consuming and expensive to defend or prosecute and to resolve 
if other companies prepare and file patent applications in the united states that claim technology also claimed by valentis  we may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine priority of invention which could result in substantial cost to valentis even if the outcome is favorable to us 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques  will not gain access to valentis trade secrets or disclose such technology to the public or that we can maintain and protect unpatented proprietary technology 
valentis typically requires its employees  consultants  collaborators  advisors and corporate partners to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of employment or other relationships with valentis 
there can be no assurance  however  that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for valentis technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information  that the parties to such agreements will not breach such agreements or that valentis trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be discovered independently by its competitors 
for a description of our current patent litigation  see item legal proceedings later in this document 
manufacturing and commercialization valentis commercialization strategy is based on establishing corporate collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies whereby we will primarily pursue development up through phase ii clinical trials  while our partners will be responsible for late stage clinical trials  sales  marketing and large scale clinical and commercial manufacturing 
valentis intends that its large scale manufacturing of plasmid dna will be conducted either through contract manufacturing organizations cmos or at our corporate partners site after technology transfer 
through previous work at several cmos  we have demonstrated that we can manufacture plasmid dna at scales required for clinical trials using conventional and proprietary fermentation and purification processes 
the facilitating agents of valentis gene delivery systems can be synthesized using readily scalable  organic synthesis procedures 
to date  we have obtained access to manufacturing of facilitating agents through arrangements with cmos 
preparation of the final formulations has been carried out at our pilot manufacturing facility and at contract manufacturers 
valentis intends that manufacturing  if any  of pegylation products will be conducted with cmos or at potential corporate partner facilities 
valentis itself does not currently operate manufacturing facilities for commercial production of its products 
we have no experience in  and currently lack the resources and capability needed for  the manufacture or marketing of any of our products on a commercial scale 
accordingly  valentis will be dependent initially on corporate partners  licensees or other third parties for commercial scale manufacturing of our products 
we are not aware of third parties that have demonstrated sustained large scale commercial manufacturing of gene therapeutics 
there can be no assurance that our corporate partners will be able to develop adequate manufacturing capabilities for production of commercial scale quantities of our products 
government regulation the production and marketing of valentis products and our research and development activities are subject to extensive regulation for safety  efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  pharmaceutical products are subject to rigorous regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda 
we believe that the fda and comparable foreign regulatory bodies will regulate the commercial uses of our products as biologics 
biologics are regulated under certain provisions of the public health service act and the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
these laws and the related regulations govern  among other things  the testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  and the promotion  marketing and distribution of biological products 
at the fda  the center for biologics evaluation and research is responsible for the regulation of biological products and has handled the fda s regulation of most gene therapeutics to date 
gene therapy  however  is a relatively new technology  and it is uncertain whether any unique regulatory requirements may be imposed upon gene therapeutics 
we are not aware of any gene therapeutics that have received marketing approval from the fda or any comparable foreign authorities 
the necessary steps to take before a new biological product may be marketed in the united states include the following i laboratory tests and animal studies  ii the submission to the fda of an investigational new drug ind for clinical testing  which must become effective before clinical trials commence  iii under certain circumstances  approval by a special advisory committee convened to review clinical trial protocols involving gene therapeutics  iv adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product  v the submission to the fda of a biologics license application bla  and vi fda approval of the bla prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the biologic 
facilities used for the manufacture of biologics are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other authorities  where applicable  and must comply with the fda s good manufacturing practice gmp regulations 
manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the fda s general biological product standards and may also be subject to state regulation 
failure to comply with gmp or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in withdrawal of marketing approval  criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  warning letters  total or partial suspension of production  suspension of clinical trials  fda refusal to review pending marketing approval applications or supplements to approved applications  or injunctions  as well as other legal or regulatory action against valentis or its corporate partners 
clinical trials are conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
in phase i the initial introduction of the product into human subjects or patients  the drug is tested to assess safety  metabolism  pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions associated with increasing doses 
phase ii usually involves studies in a limited patient population to i determine the efficacy of the potential product for specific  targeted indications  ii determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  and iii further identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
if a compound is found to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  phase iii trials are undertaken to further evaluate clinical efficacy and test for safety within a broader patient population at geographically dispersed clinical sites 
there can be no assurance that phase i  phase ii or phase iii testing will be completed successfully within any specific time period  if at all  with respect to any of valentis or its corporate partners products subject to such testing 
in addition  after marketing approval is granted  the fda may require post marketing clinical studies that typically entail extensive patient monitoring and may result in restricted marketing of the product for an extended period of time 
the results of product development  preclinical animal studies  and human studies are submitted to the fda as part of the bla 
the bla must also contain extensive manufacturing information  and each manufacturing facility must be inspected and approved by the fda before the bla will be approved 
similar regulatory approval requirements exist for the marketing of these products outside the united states eg  europe and japan 
the testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time  effort and financial and human resources  and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all  or that any product developed by valentis and its corporate partners will prove safe and effective in clinical trials or will meet all the applicable regulatory requirements necessary to receive marketing approval from the fda or the comparable regulatory body of other countries 
data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials are subject to interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the fda may deny the bla if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied  require additional testing or information  or require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product 
moreover  if regulatory approval of a biological product is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
finally  product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing 
among the conditions for bla approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to the appropriate gmp regulations  which must be followed at all times 
in complying with standards set forth in these regulations  manufacturers must continue to expend time  financial resources and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance 
for clinical investigation and marketing outside the united states  valentis and our corporate partners may be subject to fda as well as regulatory requirements of other countries 
the fda regulates the export of biological products  whether for clinical investigation or commercial sale 
in europe  the approval process for the commencement of clinical trials varies from country to country 
the regulatory approval process in other countries includes requirements similar to those associated with fda approval set forth above 
approval by the fda does not ensure approval by the regulatory authorities of other countries 
valentis research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and radioactive materials and produce waste products 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by such laws and regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated completely 
in the event of such an accident  valentis could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could exceed our resources 
although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future or that any of the operations  business or assets of valentis will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations 
competition gene delivery and gene based therapeutics are relatively new  rapidly evolving areas of science in which significant and unexpected technological advances are likely 
rapid technological development could result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete before we recover a significant portion of our related research  development and capital expenditures 
we are aware that several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are actively engaged in research and development in areas related to gene therapy or have commenced clinical trials of gene therapeutics 
many of these companies are addressing diseases that have been targeted by valentis or our corporate partners 
valentis also may experience competition from companies that have acquired or may acquire gene technology from universities and other research institutions 
as competitors develop their technologies  they may develop proprietary positions in certain aspects of gene delivery and gene therapeutics that may materially and adversely affect us 
in addition  we face and will continue to face competition from other companies for corporate collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to proprietary technology  including intellectual property related to gene delivery systems 
corporate partners may also elect to internally develop gene therapeutics that compete with our products 
lastly  other companies are developing non gene therapies to treat these same diseases 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive 
we are aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are pursuing gene based therapeutics for example  we are aware that vical inc  targeted genetics corp  genvec  inc  cell genesys  inc  avigen  inc  introgen and corautus are also engaged in developing gene based therapies 
many of these companies are addressing diseases that have been targeted by us directly or through our corporate partners  and many of them may have more experience in these areas 
we also face competition from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies using more traditional approaches to treating human diseases 
our competitors may develop safer  more effective or less costly biologic delivery systems  gene based therapeutics or chemical based therapies 
in addition  competitors may achieve superior patent protection or obtain regulatory approval or product commercialization earlier than we do 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater product development capabilities and financial  scientific  manufacturing  managerial and human resources than valentis 
there can be no assurance that research and development by others will not render our gene delivery systems  or the products developed by corporate partners using our gene delivery systems obsolete  or non competitive  or that any product we or our corporate partners develop will be preferred to any existing or newly developed technologies 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop safer  more effective or less costly gene delivery systems  gene therapeutics  non gene therapies  or other therapies  achieve superior patent protection or obtain regulatory approval or product commercialization earlier than valentis  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
product liability insurance the manufacture and sale of human therapeutic products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity 
valentis currently has only limited product liability insurance  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain existing or obtain additional product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
such insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
an inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products by valentis 
a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage  if any  or a product withdrawal  could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
employees as of september   valentis employed individuals full time  including who hold doctoral degrees 
of our total work force  employees are engaged in or directly support research and development activities  and are engaged in business development  finance and administrative activities 
valentis employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe our relationships with our employees are good 
additional factors that may affect future results the following risk factors outline certain risks and uncertainties concerning future results and should be read in conjunction with the information contained in this annual report on form k 
any of these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or those we currently deem immaterial  may also materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have received a going concern opinion from our independent auditors and this may negatively impact our business and stock price 
we have experienced net losses since our inception through june   and reported a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended june   and our accumulated deficit was million at june  the company expects such losses to continue into the foreseeable future as it proceeds with the research  development and commercialization of its technologies 
the company s cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at june  to million at june  we have received a report from our independent auditors covering the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  that included an explanatory paragraph  which stated that the financial statements have been prepared assuming valentis  will continue as a going concern 
the explanatory paragraph stated the following conditions which raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern i we have incurred recurring operating losses since inception  and ii we have declining cash and investment balances 
we will need to raise additional funds to continue our operations 
we will have insufficient working capital to fund our near term cash needs unless we are able to raise additional capital in the near future 
based upon the company s current operating plan  we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents as of june   together with projected interest income and the million received from johnson johnson in july as settlement for the patent infringement litigation see note subsequent event in our notes to consolidated financial statements  will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations at least through march   in the absence of additional financial resources 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
any failure to obtain an adequate and timely amount of additional capital on commercially reasonable terms will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including our viability as an enterprise 
as a result of these concerns  we are pursuing strategic alternatives  which may include the sale or merger of our business  sale of certain assets or other actions 
there are no assurances that we can maintain our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
effective with the open of business on january   the company s common stock began trading on the nasdaq smallcap market pursuant to an exception which requires the company to  among other things  on or before september   file with the sec and nasdaq the form k for the fiscal year ending june  evidencing the company s continued compliance with the million minimum stockholders equity requirement and all other requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
in addition to the foregoing  the company must be able to demonstrate an ability to sustain compliance with all requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
as evidenced by this annual report on form k  the company is currently in compliance with the million minimum stockholders equity requirement  and the company believes that it is currently in compliance with all other requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
nasdaq has notified the company that in the event the company fails to demonstrate compliance  as well as an ability to sustain compliance  with all requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  including nasdaq s corporate governance criteria  the company s securities will be delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
if the company s securities are delisted from the nasdaq stock market  the trading of the company s common stock is likely to be conducted on the otc bulletin board 
the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq stock market will result in decreased liquidity of our outstanding shares of common stock and a resulting inability of our stockholders to sell our common stock or obtain accurate quotations as to their market value  and  consequently  would reduce the price at which our shares trade 
the delisting of our common stock could also deter broker dealers from making a market in or otherwise generating interest in our common stock and would adversely affect our ability to attract investors in our common stock 
furthermore  our ability to raise additional capital would be severely impaired 
as a result of these factors  the value of the common stock would decline significantly  and our stockholders could lose some or all of their investment 
we must be able to continue to secure additional financing in order to continue our operations 
we will have insufficient working capital to fund our near term cash needs unless we are able to raise additional capital in the near future 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
any failure to obtain an adequate and timely amount of additional capital on commercially reasonable terms will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including our viability as an enterprise 
as a result of these concerns  we are pursuing strategic alternatives  which may include the sale or merger of our business  or the sale of certain assets or other actions 
we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and through corporate collaborations 
we raised million in our initial public offering in september  million through a private placement of our common stock in april  million through the sale of series a preferred stock and common stock warrants in december and million from a public offering of common stock in december since september  we have received million from corporate collaborations  of which million was from roche holdings and  from boehringer ingelheim 
in addition  since september  we have received million from licensing our technologies to others 
we have not generated significant royalty revenues from product sales  and we do not expect to do so for the foreseeable future  if ever 
our cash and cash equivalents at june  were million 
based upon the company s current operating plan  we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents as of june   together with projected interest income and the million received from johnson johnson in july as settlement for the patent infringement litigation see note subsequent event in our notes to consolidated financial statements  will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations at least through march   in the absence of additional financial resources 
in order to maintain our current and planned operations beyond march   we will be seeking additional corporate transactions  such as corporate partnership agreements  licenses and or asset sales  as well as additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing or merger of our business 
we may not be able to enter into any such corporate transactions  however or  if entered into  the terms of any such agreements may not generate near term revenues 
moreover  additional financing to meet our funding requirements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
actions we may take to conserve our cash resources include a reduction in our personnel  delaying or scaling back our development program or relinquishing greater or all rights to products at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we otherwise would 
any or all of these actions would materially adversely affect valentis business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
in addition  the development and marketing of our potential products will require substantial additional financial resources 
because we cannot expect internally generated cash flow to fund the development and marketing of our products  we must look to outside sources for funding 
these sources could involve one or more of the following types of transactions  which we continue to actively seek technology partnerships  technology sales  technology licenses  issuance of debt securities  or sales of common or preferred stock 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in our research and development programs  size and complexity of such programs  scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  ability to establish and maintain corporate collaborations  time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  time and costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and the cost of manufacturing material for preclinical  clinical and commercial purposes 
the future success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain corporate partners to develop and market our gene therapy or other products 
our business strategy is to attract business partners to fund or conduct research and development  clinical trials  manufacturing  marketing and sales of our gene therapy or other products 
this strategy makes us highly dependent upon corporate collaborations as a source of funding for our research and development and clinical trials 
we currently have no corporate partners for our del product  and are seeking partners to develop and market it 
we face intense competition from many other companies for corporate collaborations  as well as for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for obtaining licenses to proprietary technology 
if we are unable to attract and retain corporate partners to develop and market our products  or if our corporate partnerships are not successful  our business will fail 
we have a history of losses and may never be profitable 
we have engaged in research and development activities since our inception 
we have generated only small amounts of revenue and have experienced significant operating losses since we began business 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded total revenues of approximately million and a net loss of approximately million 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit totaling approximately million 
the development of our products will require significant additional research and development activities 
these activities  together with general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in operating losses for the foreseeable future 
if the market price of our common stock continues to be highly volatile  the value of your investment in the common stock could decline 
within the last months  our common stock has traded between a high of and a low of as adjusted for the one for thirty reverse stock split effected january  
the market price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile  particularly in light of the recent one for thirty reverse stock split of our common stock  which has significantly reduced the number  and liquidity  of the freely tradable shares of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors  most of which are beyond our control  including the following results of our clinical trials and preclinical studies  or those of our corporate partners or competitors  our operating results  including results below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  developments in our relationships with corporate partners  developments affecting our corporate partners  negative regulatory action or regulatory approval with respect to our announcement or our competitors announcement of new products  developments related to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors  changes in the position of securities analysts with respect to our stock  fluctuations in the trading volume of our stock  acquisition or merger of the company by or with another company  changes in our eligibility for continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market  and market conditions for biopharmaceutical or biotechnology stock in general 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price of our common stock 
the sale and issuance of the series a preferred stock impacts earnings available to common stockholders 
under accounting rules  approximately million of the proceeds from our sale of series a preferred stock was allocated to the common stock purchase warrants  the beneficial conversion feature and issuance costs and are reflected as additional paid in capital 
this million was being accreted to the preferred stock amount and recorded as deemed dividends over the term of the initial year redemption period 
this accretion  along with the preferred stock dividend  increases the net loss reduces the net income available to common stockholders 
upon conversion of the series a preferred stock to common stock in january  the remaining million of unaccreted deemed dividends representing the balance of amounts attributed to common stock purchase warrants  beneficial conversion feature and issuance costs related to the series a preferred stock were accreted and recorded as a deemed dividend 
this deemed dividend is included in the calculation of net loss applicable to common stockholders in the financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  additionally  as a result of the simultaneous conversion of the series a preferred stock to common stock and the reduction in the series a preferred stock conversion price  the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued to the series a preferred stockholders over the fair value of the common stock issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms was approximately million 
this amount also is included in the calculation of net loss applicable to common stockholders in the financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  concentration of ownership among our existing principal stockholders  executive officers  directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 
our existing principal stockholders  executive officers  directors and their affiliates beneficially own or control in excess of of the outstanding shares of common stock  with over of the outstanding shares held by two such entities  perseus soros biopharmaceutical fund  lp and diaz altschul capital management  llc 
as a result  such entities may have the ability to effectively control the company and direct its affairs and business 
such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
development and commercial introduction of our gene therapy and other products will require several years of research and development and clinical trials and must satisfy applicable government regulations 
all of our potential products currently are in research  preclinical development or the early stages of clinical testing  and commercialization of those products will not occur for at least the next several years  if at all 
gene therapeutics is a new field and may not lead to commercially viable pharmaceutical products 
prior to commercialization  a potential drug or biological product must undergo rigorous clinical trials that meet the requirements of the food and drug administration  or fda  in order to demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans 
we have limited experience in conducting clinical trials  and we may encounter problems that cause us  or the fda  to delay  suspend or terminate these studies and trials 
problems we may encounter include the unavailability of preferred sites for conducting the trials  an insufficient number of test subjects and other factors which may delay the advancement of our clinical trials  lead to increased costs or result in the termination of the clinical trials altogether 
furthermore  the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time if it believes the subjects participating in the trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or if it finds deficiencies in the clinical trial process or the conduct of the investigation 
while many of these risks are common to biotechnology companies in general  in light of the issues raised in when the fda stopped a gene therapy clinical trial due to the death of a patient  we may face greater risks in this area than other biotechnology companies because of our focus on gene based therapeutics 
even if we successfully complete the required preclinical testing and clinical trials  we may not be able to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to market our gene therapy and other products in the united states or abroad 
the approval procedures for marketing outside the united states vary among countries and can involve additional testing 
we and other gene therapy companies have limited experience with the regulatory process  which for our industry tends to be costly  time consuming and subject to unpredictable delays 
accordingly  we cannot predict with any certainty how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for manufacturing and marketing our products or whether we will be able to obtain those regulatory approvals at all 
we must rely on our partners to demonstrate large scale manufacturing capabilities in order to be successful 
our limited manufacturing experience makes our ability to successfully introduce our potential products more difficult than it would be otherwise 
although we have a license agreement with dsm biologics dsm for manufacturing and supplying plasmid dna to the gene therapy industry  neither dsm nor any third party has successfully manufactured plasmid dna on a sustained large scale commercial basis 
we will depend on our contract manufacturing organization cmo  cangene corporation cangene  another cmo or a future corporate partner for commercial scale manufacturing of our products 
cangene and or our corporate partners may be unable to develop adequate manufacturing capabilities for commercial scale quantities of gene products 
if cangene or third parties are unable to establish and maintain large scale manufacturing capabilities  we will be unable to introduce sufficient products to sustain our business 
problems in our cmo s manufacturing facilities may delay clinical trials or regulatory approval for del or future products 
drug manufacturing facilities regulated by the fda must comply with the fda s good manufacturing practice regulations 
such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and state authorities 
manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the fda s general biological product standards and also may be subject to state regulation 
we may be unable to ensure that our contract manufacturers attain or maintain compliance with current or future good manufacturing practice requirements 
as we have experienced  the failure of our contract manufacturer to comply with good manufacturing practice requirements could cause significant delay of important clinical trials 
for example  in august  we discovered manufacturing issues at our contract manufacturer that resulted in a delay in our del peripheral arterial disease pad clinical trial 
when we discovered the issues  we postponed enrollment in the clinical trial until we could fully assess their impact 
we also informed the fda of the issues 
on september   the fda placed a clinical hold on our del pad clinical trial 
on february   the fda allowed us to proceed with our pad safety trial using newly manufactured material 
since that time  we have manufactured new material at another manufacturing site 
if we were to discover other problems  the fda could suspend or further delay our clinical trials or place restrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials  including the mandatory withdrawal of the product from the clinical trials 
this  or an unexpected increase in the cost of compliance  could hinder our ability to develop products for commercialization 
if the success of our potential products in animal models is not replicated in our human trials  the development of our products will be negatively impacted 
although a number of our potential products  including del  have shown successful results in early stage animal models  these results may not be replicated in our human trials for those products 
in addition  human results could be different from our expectations following our preclinical studies with large animals 
if results in our human trials for a particular product are not consistent with the results in the animal models  then we may have to return the product to preclinical development or abandon development of the potential product 
the results of our early clinical trials are based on a small number of patients over a short period of time  and our success may not be indicative of results in a large number of patients or long term efficacy 
the results in early phases of clinical testing are based upon limited numbers of patients and a limited follow up period 
typically  our phase i clinical trials for indications of safety enroll less than patients 
our phase ii clinical trials for efficacy typically enroll approximately patients 
actual results with more data points may not confirm favorable results from earlier stage trials 
in addition  we do not yet know if early results will have a lasting effect 
if a larger population of patients does not experience positive results  or if these results do not have a lasting effect  our products may not receive approval from the fda 
moreover  any report of clinical trial results that are below the expectations of financial analysts or investors would most likely cause our stock price to drop dramatically 
there can be no assurance that phase i  phase ii or phase iii clinical testing will be completed successfully within any specific time period 
there can be no assurance that phase i  phase ii or phase iii clinical testing will be completed successfully within any specific time period  if at all  with respect to any of valentis or its corporate partners products subject to such testing 
in addition  after marketing approval is granted  the fda may require post marketing clinical studies that typically entail extensive patient monitoring and may result in restricted marketing of the product for an extended period of time 
the clinical testing and fda approval process is likely to require substantial time  effort and financial and human resources  and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis 
the clinical testing and fda approval process is likely to require substantial time  effort and financial and human resources  and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all  or that any product developed by valentis and its corporate partners will prove safe and effective in clinical trials or will meet all the applicable regulatory requirements necessary to receive marketing approval from the fda or the comparable regulatory body of other countries 
data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials are subject to interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
adverse events in the field of gene therapy may negatively impact regulatory approval or public perception of our potential products 
the death in of a patient undergoing a physician sponsored  viral based gene therapy trial has been widely publicized 
following this death and publicity surrounding the field of gene therapy  the fda appears to have become more conservative regarding the conduct of gene therapy clinical trials 
this approach by the fda can lead to delays in the timelines for regulatory review  as well as potential delays in the conduct of our gene therapy clinical trials 
in addition  the negative publicity around the field of gene therapy appears to have affected patients willingness to participate in some gene therapy clinical trials 
if fewer patients are willing to participate in our clinical trials  the timelines for recruiting patients and conducting the trials will be delayed 
the commercial success of our potential products will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of gene therapy for the prevention or treatment of human diseases 
negative public reaction to gene therapy in general could result in stricter labeling requirements of gene therapy products  including any of our products  and could cause a decrease in the demand for products we may develop 
intense competition in the biopharmaceuticals market may adversely impact our business 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive 
we are aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are pursuing gene based therapeutics for example  we are aware that vical inc  targeted genetics corp  genvec  inc  cell genesys  inc  avigen  inc  introgen and corautus are also engaged in developing gene based therapies 
many of these companies are addressing diseases that have been targeted by us directly or through our corporate partners  and many of them may have more experience in these areas 
we also face competition from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies using more traditional approaches to treating human diseases 
our competitors may develop safer  more effective or less costly biologic delivery systems  gene based therapeutics or chemical based therapies 
in addition  competitors may achieve superior patent protection or obtain regulatory approval or product commercialization earlier than we do 
many of our competitors have substantially more experience and financial and infrastructure resources than we do in the following areas research  development  including clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and manufacturing  marketing and distribution 
gene therapy is a new and rapidly evolving field and is expected to continue to undergo significant and rapid technological change 
rapid technological development by our competitors could result in our actual and proposed technologies  products or processes losing market share or becoming obsolete 
we face intense competition and other obstacles in recruiting the limited number of qualified personnel for key management  scientific and technical positions 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain management  scientific and technical staff to develop our potential products and formulate our research and development strategy 
the san francisco bay area  where our corporate headquarters and clinical development center is located  is home to a large number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  and there is a limited number of qualified individuals to fill key scientific and technical positions 
our recruiting efforts are further hampered by the high cost of living in the bay area and the competing opportunities in academia that may attract individuals with advanced scientific degrees 
although we have programs in place to retain personnel  including programs to create a positive work environment and competitive compensation packages  competition for key scientific and technical employees in our field is intense  and it may be difficult for us to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees 
additionally  after the corporate reorganization announced in january that resulted in the termination of positions and the subsequent corporate reorganization announced in october that resulted in the termination of positions  it may be more difficult to recruit personnel in the future 
if we do not attract and retain qualified personnel  our research and development programs could be delayed  and we could experience difficulties in generating sufficient revenue to maintain our business 
if we are unable to obtain rights to proprietary genes  proteins or other technologies  we will be unable to operate our business 
our gene based products involve multiple component technologies  many of which may be patented by others 
for example  our products use gene sequences  some of which have been  or may be  patented by others 
as a result  we may be required to obtain licenses to those gene sequences  proteins or other technologies 
we may not be able to obtain a license to those technologies on reasonable terms  if at all 
as a consequence  we might be prohibited from developing potential products or we might have to make cumulative royalty payments to several companies 
these cumulative royalties would reduce amounts paid to us or could make our products too expensive to develop or market 
an inability to protect our patents and proprietary rights may adversely impact our business 
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights  which may limit our ability to compete effectively 
our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to obtain patents and patent licenses  preserve trade secrets  and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we own or have licenses to patents on a number of genes  processes  practices and techniques critical to our existing and potential gene therapy or other products 
patent positions in the field of biotechnology are highly uncertain and involve complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
even if we secure a patent  the patent may not afford adequate protection against our competitors 
if we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies  our competitors may market competing products that threaten our market position 
in addition  the failure of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection for technology they license to us could similarly harm our business 
in july  polymasc announced that it settled its patent infringement litigation against alza corporation  a unit of johnson johnson 
under the settlement  polymasc received million  and granted a worldwide license to alza under its peg liposome patents 
the agreement settles pending patent infringement litigation in the united states and germany  as well as opposition proceedings in japan and before the european patent office 
for a description of our current patent litigation  see item legal proceedings later in this document 
in any event  intellectual property disputes could be costly  could divert management s attention and resources away from our operations  and could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidation of our patent rights 
as the biotechnology industry expands  the risks increase that other companies may challenge our proprietary rights or claim that our processes and potential products infringe on their patents 
if we infringe on another company s patented processes or technology  we may have to obtain a license in order to continue manufacturing or marketing the affected product or using the affected process or have to pay damages 
we may be unable to obtain a license on acceptable terms or at all 
we also rely on unpatented trade secret technologies 
because these technologies do not benefit from the protection of patents  we may be unable to meaningfully protect these trade secret technologies from unauthorized use or misappropriation by a third party 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and radioactive materials and produce waste products 
valentis research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and radioactive materials and produce waste products 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by such laws and regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated completely 
in the event of such an accident  valentis could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could exceed our resources 
although we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future or that any of the operations  business or assets of valentis will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations

company overview valentis  inc valentis is converting biologic discoveries into innovative products 
the company s lead product that is currently in human testing is the del angiogenesis gene formulated with one of the company s proprietary polymer delivery systems 
the company is developing its other technologies  the geneswitch and dna vaccine delivery technologies  through partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the merger of megabios corp 
and genemedicine  inc in march formed valentis inc  a delaware corporation 
in august  valentis acquired uk based polymasc pharmaceuticals plc 
valentis is located in burlingame  california  which is the company s headquarters  as well as the center for manufacturing  and clinical and preclinical development 
previously  valentis had locations in the woodlands  texas and london  england 
in april  the company announced that it would consolidate all of its pegylation research activities from its facilities in london  england into its preclinical center in the woodlands  texas 
the consolidation was substantially completed in september in january and october  valentis implemented restructuring plans to better align the company s cost structure with current market conditions 
these plans significantly reduced its preclinical product development efforts and suspended its clinical programs in oncology in an effort to lower future expenditures and conserve cash 
a total of positions  primarily in preclinical  clinical and manufacturing research and development  and associated general and administrative staff  were eliminated as a result of the restructurings 
as a result of its restructurings  the company exited the woodlands facility  which housed the company s preclinical development  in june in september  the company entered into a lease termination agreement with the landlord of the woodlands facility 
pursuant to the lease termination agreement  the woodlands facility lease was terminated on september  also  as a result of its restructurings  the company will exit  square feet of the burlingame facility in october pursuant to a lease termination agreement with the landlord of the burlingame facility  executed in july technologies valentis technologies provide novel ways to achieve production of therapeutic proteins in their most natural and active forms at specific sites within the body 
our products  genes formulated with synthetic delivery systems  are administered to specific tissues where they enter targeted cells 
these cells then produce the therapeutic proteins or vaccine antigens 
the fidelity  specificity and duration of expression within the target cells may also be controlled by valentis proprietary gene regulation systems 
synthetic gene delivery systems valentis has developed synthetic gene delivery systems based on several classes of polymers and lipids 
our pinc polymeric  non condensing polymers are designed to provide efficient delivery to a variety of tissues  including muscle and solid tumors 
they provide for higher and more consistent levels of protein production 
valentis cationic lipid formulations provide efficient delivery after intravenous or intratumoral administration 
the ability of both delivery systems to enhance cellular distribution and uptake of genes in vivo has resulted in the production of therapeutic levels of proteins 
gene regulation systems valentis geneswitch technologies permit therapeutic protein production that is controlled via an orally administered drug 
products incorporating our geneswitch technology are delivered with a polymer delivery system and electroporation 
this results in controlled production of therapeutic proteins from muscle tissue for prolonged periods 
the geneswitch gene regulation system is available for licensing as a functional genomics research tool 
non exclusive licensees of the geneswitch system include glaxosmithkline  lexicon genetics  larnax gmbh  pfizer  schering ag  senomyx and wyeth ayerst laboratories the pharmaceutical division of american home products 
synthetic vaccine delivery systems valentis has developed synthetic vaccine delivery systems based on several classes of polymers 
our proprietary pinc polymer based delivery technologies for intramuscular administration provide for higher and more consistent levels of antigen production 
current good manufacturing practices manufacturing valentis has developed proprietary scalable processes for the manufacture of plasmid dna and gene based products 
through a strategy of using a contract manufacturing organization cmo for plasmid dna production of our products  we are able to produce material from lab to commercial scale using the same process 
most recently  cangene corporation has been our primary cmo 
in addition  in june  valentis entered into a new agreement that reinstates a license to dsm biologics dsm to use valentis manufacturing technology 
the terms of the original agreement between valentis and dsm  entered into in september   were modified to add a royalty to valentis in addition to the previously agreed upon profit sharing arrangement 
technology licenses valentis currently licenses technology to epimmune inc for the license of valentis proprietary pinc gene delivery technology for hiv and hcv vaccines  and cancer immunotherapies 
genencor international for the license of valentis proprietary pinc gene delivery technology for hbv and hpv vaccines 
heska corporation for gene immunotherapeutics for cancer and allergies in companion animals 
invitrogen corporation to sell valentis proprietary geneswitch gene regulation system to the research market 
juvaris biotherapeutics  inc for valentis proprietary plasmid backbone and cationic lipid delivery technologies for the development and commercialization of therapeutic vaccine products 
prolong pharmaceuticals for use of its proprietary optipeg pegylation platform in the development and commercialization of pegylated protein therapeutics 
schering ag for the exclusive  world wide rights to valentis pinc polymer based synthetic gene delivery and the geneswitch gene regulation technologies for use with up to two genes proprietary to schering  and an option for non exclusive rights to the pinc technology for a third gene 
valentis has licensed its proprietary geneswitch gene regulation technology on a non exclusive basis to genzyme corporation  glaxosmithkline  lexicon genetics  medigene ag  pfizer inc  senomyx  inc  and wyeth ayerst laboratories the pharmaceutical division of american home products  in each case  for research 
further  valentis has established a non exclusive cross license with genzyme corporation in which genzyme receives rights to geneswitch gene regulation technology for research use  and valentis receives certain rights to genzyme s plasmid dna manufacturing technology 
valentis also has licensed technology from genetronics biomedical corp 
for in vivo electroporation technology for use in the development of certain gene based products 
critical accounting policies clinical trial expenses valentis believes the clinical trial expense accounting policy represents its most significant estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
valentis accruals for clinical trial expenses are based in part on estimates of services received and efforts expended pursuant to agreements established with clinical research organizations and clinical trial sites 
we have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on behalf of valentis in the ongoing development of our biopharmaceutical drugs 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
the company determines its estimates through discussion with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
the objective of valentis clinical trial accrual policy is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in our financial statements by matching period expenses with period services and efforts expended 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we accrue expenses associated with an estimate of the remaining  non cancelable obligations associated with the winding down of the trial 
revenue recognition non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology advancement funding that is intended for the development of the company s core technology  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
revenue related to collaborative research with the company s corporate collaborators is recognized as research services are performed over the related funding periods for each contract 
under these agreements  the company is required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement 
the payments received under each respective agreement are not refundable and are generally based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the terms of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result when the company does not incur the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective contracts 
payments received relative to substantive  at risk incentive milestones  if any  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone event because the company has no future performance obligations related to the payment 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by results of the company s research efforts or by events external to the company  such as regulatory approval to market a product 
the company also has licensed technology to various biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
under these arrangements  the company receives nonrefundable license payments in cash 
these payments are recognized as revenue when received  provided the company has no future performance or delivery obligations under these agreements 
otherwise  revenue is deferred until performance or delivery is satisfied 
certain of these license agreements also provide the licensee an option to acquire additional licenses or technology rights for a fixed period of time 
fees received for such options are deferred and recognized at the time the option is exercised or expires unexercised 
additionally  certain of these license agreements involve technology that the company has licensed or otherwise acquired through arrangements with third parties pursuant to which the company is required to pay a royalty equal to a fixed percentage of amounts received by the company as a result of licensing this technology to others 
such royalty obligations are recorded as a reduction of the related revenue 
results of operations fiscal years ended june   and revenue revenue recognized in the years ended june   and is as follows in thousands year ended june  collaborative research and development revenue roche holdings  ltd 
  boehringer ingelheim license and other collaborative revenue dsm biologics  schering ag glaxosmithkline  other grant revenue total revenue    changes in revenue for each of the fiscal years ended june   and are explained below no revenue was recognized from roche in fiscal  as the collaboration with roche ended in the prior year in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
revenue from roche for fiscal years and was recognized in accordance with the performance of research obligations under the agreement 
no revenue was recognized from boehringer ingelheim for fiscal years and due to the completion of the agreement in november in january  valentis reinstated  on revised financial terms  the original manufacturing technology license agreement with dsm biologics 
in fiscal  a total of million was recognized as license revenue  which included million derived from the newly reinstated agreement and  derived from the original agreement 
in december  valentis entered into a multi product license and option agreement with schering ag 
revenue of  was recognized from this agreement in fiscal revenue from glaxosmithkline was approximately million in fiscal this primarily reflects amounts earned under an expanded geneswitch licensing agreement with glaxosmithkline  which was entered into in december other revenue recognized in fiscal and resulted primarily from several license agreements for valentis geneswitch technology  totaling approximately  and  respectively 
other revenue in fiscal resulted primarily from license revenue derived from an agreement with heska of approximately  revenue generated by several license agreements for valentis geneswitch technology of approximately  and revenue derived from the licensing of pegylation technology of approximately grant revenue recognized in and was due to work performed under small business innovation research sbir grants  which was completed in august revenue derived from corporate collaborations and grants may increase in the future if we are successful in establishing new collaborations and are awarded additional sbir grants 
if we are unsuccessful in establishing new collaborations and grants  revenues will decline 
likewise  a reduction in funds for conducting our research and development  clinical trial  manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts will occur 
expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended june   million in  and million in the decrease in expenses in fiscal compared to  as well as compared to  was primarily attributable to staff reductions and savings resulting from the reduction of preclinical product development efforts and suspension of clinical programs in oncology in january  and lower expenditures resulting from the further reduction of staff in october valentis expects its total annual research and development expenses to decrease in the future reflecting the full benefits of its corporate restructurings and cost reductions actions  and its prioritization of its del product 
however  research and development expenses may increase if the company is successful in securing additional new strategic partnerships and funding to support increased spending levels 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animal studies and phase i  ii  and iii clinical studies in humans each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
our research and development expenses currently include costs for scientific personnel  animal studies  supplies  equipment  consultants  patent filings  overhead allocation  human clinical trials and sponsored research at academic and research institutions 
as a result of its restructuring efforts  valentis currently operates in one business segment  the research and development of biopharmaceutical products and associated delivery systems 
prior to its restructuring efforts  valentis operated in two business segments i the research and development of biopharmaceutical products and associated delivery systems  and ii pegylation products 
for the years ended june   and  we estimate that the division of research and development expenses between biopharmaceutical products and associated delivery systems and pegylation products was million and zero  million and million  and million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million in the increase was attributable primarily to increased professional fees resulting from the company s capital restructuring efforts  the patent infringement lawsuit with alza corporation and lease exit expenses  partially offset by savings resulting from the reduction of general and administrative staff associated with our restructuring actions 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended june  from million in the decrease was attributable primarily to savings resulting from the reduction of general and administrative staff associated with our reductions in preclinical product development and suspended clinical programs in oncology 
we expect our future annual general and administrative expenses to decrease to reflect the company s overall cost reduction plans 
however  general and administrative expenses may increase due to the addition of staff and facilities to support increased research and development efforts if the company is successful in securing new strategic partnerships and funding to support increased research and development activities 
valentis recorded million and million for amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets for fiscal and  respectively  which is associated with the acquisitions of genemedicine in fiscal and polymasc in fiscal we adopted sfas see note organizations and summary of significant accounting policies in our notes to consolidated financial statements on july  as of june   the company had a net goodwill and other intangible assets balance of approximately  consisting solely of goodwill  which is no longer being amortized but is subject to an impairment analysis on at least an annual basis in accordance with the requirements of sfas we completed the initial required impairment analyses in accordance with sfas as of july   and further analyses as of december  and during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and determined in each case that goodwill was not impaired 
corporate restructuring in conjunction with the company s announcement in january that it would suspend clinical development of its cancer immunotherapy products  valentis implemented a restructuring plan to better align the company s cost structure with current market conditions 
this plan significantly reduced the company s preclinical product development efforts and suspended its clinical programs in oncology in an effort to lower future expenditures and conserve cash 
a total of positions  primarily in preclinical and manufacturing research and development  and associated general and administrative staff  were eliminated as a result of the restructuring 
for the year ended june   we recorded restructuring and related charges of approximately million  of which approximately million was recorded for employee severance 
of the million charge  approximately  was paid as of june  and the remaining approximately  was fully paid during the year ended june  all of the employees whose positions were eliminated were terminated as of june  in addition  the company wrote off certain equipment and furniture located in the company s research facility in the woodlands  texas that would no longer be used due to the restructuring 
the net book value of these assets totaled approximately  and was recorded in the year ended june  as an impairment charge associated with the company s restructuring plan 
in october  the company announced that it had further reduced its staff and planned expenditures to allow it to continue the development of its two lead products del product for the treatment of a variety of cardiovascular diseases including peripheral arterial disease pad and ischemic heart disease ihd  and the geneswitch product through the licensing of this technology to other companies 
in connection therewith  the company reduced staff by individuals in order to reduce the company s cash expenditures 
this reduction included j 
tyler martin  md  senior vice president  research and development  and margaret m 
snowden  general counsel  who left the company 
ms 
snowden currently serves in a consulting capacity to valentis 
for the year ended june   we recorded restructuring and related charges in the consolidated statements of operations of approximately  for employee severance 
this entire amount was paid during the year ended june  in connection with the reduction in workforce in january and october  the company modified the terms of vested options to allow for an extended exercise period of months 
this modification did not result in the company recording any stock based compensation charges  as the exercise prices of the options exceeded the per share price of the company s common stock at the date of the modification 
the estimated savings as a result of our combined restructurings has the effect of reducing our operating expenses from approximately million per quarter before the combined restructurings to approximately million per quarter after the combined restructurings 
the company expects to incur operating expenses of approximately million per quarter for the foreseeable future 
other income and interest expense  net interest and other income expense  net was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in interest and other income expense  net in fiscal compared to resulted primarily from decreased interest income derived from lower investment balances  partially offset by decreased interest expense derived form lower loan balances and favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
the increase in interest and other income expense  net in fiscal compared to resulted primarily from decreased interest expense derived form lower loan balances and favorable foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by decreased interest income derived from lower investment balances interest expense for fiscal  and were approximately   and  respectively

this amount also was included in the calculation of net loss applicable to common stockholders for the year ended june  dividends on series a redeemable convertible preferred stock dividends on the series a preferred stock see note redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity in our notes to consolidated financial statements were calculated at value at the rate of per annum  and were approximately  million and  for the years ended june   and  respectively  and were charged against additional paid in capital and included in the calculation of net loss applicable to common stockholders 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas prohibits the use of the pooling of interest method for business combinations initiated after june  and also applies to all business combinations that are completed after june  there was no impact to the company upon adoption of sfas under sfas  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to a test for impairment on at least an annual basis 
the company adopted sfas on july   and at such time the company had approximately  of unamortized goodwill resulting from the acquisition of polymasc pharmaceuticals plc in september  which is subject to the new accounting rules 
as a result of adopting sfas  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of the company s goodwill as of july  and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we completed the initial required impairment analyses in accordance with sfas as of july   and further analyses as of december  and during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and determined in each case that goodwill was not impaired 
however  there can be no assurance that when other periodic reviews are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  that is applicable to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   with transition provisions for certain matters 
sfas supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
although retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement provisions of statement  the new rules significantly change the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
the new rules also supersede the provisions of apb opinion with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business 
the company adopted sfas on july  the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement supercedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the statement further establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the liability and that employee benefit arrangements requiring future service beyond a minimum retention period be recognized over the future service period 
this statement is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company accounted for the exit of its facility in the woodlands  texas under sfas during the year ended june  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with operating lease agreements 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company s adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no

we will need to raise additional funds to continue our operations 
we will have insufficient working capital to fund our near term cash needs unless we are able to raise additional capital in the near future 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
any failure to obtain an adequate and timely amount of additional capital on commercially reasonable terms will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including our viability as an enterprise 
as a result of these concerns  we are pursuing strategic alternatives  which may include the sale of securities  the sale or merger of our business  the sale of certain assets or other actions 
the company will be required to seek additional sources of funding to complete development and commercialization of its products 
based upon the company s current operating plan  it anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents as of june   together with projected interest income and the million received from johnson johnson in july as settlement for the patent infringement litigation see note subsequent event in our notes to consolidated financial statements  will enable it to maintain its current and planned operations at least through march   in the absence of additional financial resources 
in an effort to seek additional sources of financing  the company may have to relinquish greater or all rights to products at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than it would otherwise seek to obtain 
the company is currently seeking additional collaborative agreements and licenses with corporate partners and may seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing or merger of its business 
the company may not be able to enter into any such agreements  however  or if entered into  any such agreements may not reduce or eliminate the company s requirements to seek additional funding 
additional financing to meet the company s funding requirements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if the company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the matters discussed above
