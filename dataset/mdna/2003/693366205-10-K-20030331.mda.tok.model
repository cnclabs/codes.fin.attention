item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the consolidated financial statements and other portions of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  including item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  reflect the effects of the restatements of our consolidated financial statements for all years from to inclusive as filed on march  on form k a for the fiscal year ended december   and presenting sequoia insurance company as discontinued operations 
company summary  recent developments  and future outlook vidler water company  inc 
water rights arizona at december   vidler owned or had the right to acquire approximately  acre feet of transferable ground water in the harquahala valley  approximately miles northwest of metropolitan phoenix  arizona 
vidler owns  acre feet  and we have the option to purchase a further  acre feet 
we believe that vidler s water rights in the harquahala valley represent the most practical and competitive source of water to support the growth of greater metropolitan phoenix  which is one of the fastest growing areas in the nation 
vidler s water rights in the harquahala valley are primarily located in maricopa county 
according to census data  maricopa county was the fastest growing county in the us between april  and july   with  new homes added  an increase of in months 
vidler anticipates that there will be municipal demand for water from the harquahala valley to support the growth of the west side cities in maricopa county  which are part of greater metropolitan phoenix 
any new residential development in arizona must obtain a permit from the arizona department of water resources certifying a designated assured water supply sufficient to sustain the development for at least years 
the harquahala valley ground water meets the designation of assured water supply 
in order for the ground water to be used by municipalities in the heavily populated parts of arizona  the water must be wheeled  or transported  from the harquahala valley to the end users 
the arizona state legislature has passed legislation which allows harquahala valley ground water to be made available as assured water supply to cities and communities in arizona through agreements with the central arizona groundwater replenishment district 
in march  vidler concluded its first sale of harquahala valley ground water for municipal use  with the sale of  acre feet of water rights and  acres of land in the harquahala valley ground water basin  to golf course developers near scottsdale 
the sale price represents  per acre foot of water 
the sale added million to revenues and approximately million to gross margin in the arizona state legislature has passed several pieces of legislation which recognize the harquahala valley ground water as a future municipal supply for the phoenix metropolitan area 
in  the expansion of irrigated farming in the valley was prohibited  and the transfer of the ground water to municipalities was authorized 
in order to protect the harquahala valley ground water from large commercial and industrial users which were moving into the basin  legislation was enacted in placing restrictions on commercial and industrial users utilizing more than acre feet of water annually 
these users are required to purchase irrigable land and to withdraw the water that they need from the land at no more than acre feet per annum per acre of land 
vidler has closed two sales of harquahala valley ground water to an industrial user within the harquahala basin in march  vidler sold  acre feet of water rights and  acres of land 
this transaction added million to revenues and million to gross margin in  and in may  vidler sold acre feet of water rights and acres of land 
this transaction added million to revenues and  to gross margin in vidler is working on further sales of harquahala valley ground water to both industrial users and communities and developers in the phoenix metropolitan area who need to secure further water to support expected growth 
nevada vidler has been increasing its ownership of water rights in northern nevada through the purchase of ranch properties and entering into joint ventures with parties owning water rights  which they wish to maximize the value of 
nevada is the state experiencing the most rapid population growth and new home construction in the united states 
the population is concentrated in southern nevada  which includes the las vegas metropolitan area 
lincoln county vidler is working jointly with lincoln county to locate and develop water resources in lincoln county  nevada 
lincoln county and vidler have filed applications for more than  acre feet of water rights  covering substantially all of the unappropriated water in the county  with the intention of supplying water to rapidly growing communities and industrial users 
we believe that this is the only known new source of water for lincoln county 
vidler anticipates that up to  acre feet of water rights will ultimately be permitted from these applications  and put to use in lincoln county 
we anticipate demand from industrial users locating new facilities in lincoln county  and from municipalities 
under the lincoln county land act  more than  acres of publicly owned land in southern lincoln county will be offered for sale near the fast growing city of mesquite 
additional water will be required if this land is to be developed 
in  lincoln vidler filed for  acre feet of water rights for industrial use from the tule desert groundwater basin 
in november  the nevada state engineer granted an application for  acre feet of water rights  and ruled that another  acre feet could be granted  but would be held in abeyance while lincoln nevada pursues additional studies 
as previously disclosed  lincoln vidler had reached conditional agreement to sell an electricity generating company between  and  acre feet of water  at  per acre foot  for a new power plant to be located in southern lincoln county on a site which was to be acquired from nevada land 
due to the unprecedented instability in the energy market and capital market conditions affecting the electricity sector  the electricity generating company decided not to move forward with the project 
recognizing that a permitted site with permitted water rights will have value once the energy market stabilizes  vidler purchased the project for  in february vidler is currently reviewing the project with energy companies and utilities 
if a financial closing with a third party occurs within two years of the purchase  vidler is required to make an additional payment to the seller of the project 
the lincoln county undertaking is an example of a transaction where vidler can partner with an entity  in this case a governmental entity  to provide the necessary capital and skills to commercially develop water assets 
sandy valley  nevada in  vidler filed an application for approximately  acre feet of water rights near sandy valley  nevada 
in june  the nevada state engineer awarded vidler acre feet of the water rights 
vidler has filed an appeal regarding the balance of the water applied for 
pending resolution of the final amount of water to be permitted  vidler has reached tentative agreement to put this water to beneficial use within nevada  to support additional growth at primm  nevada 
primm is a resort town on the border between california and nevada  in the interstate corridor 
the water rights awarded to vidler are the only known water to support future growth in primm and surrounding areas in nevada near the california state line 
muddy river water rights the muddy river is a perennial river fed by the muddy springs in southern nevada  originating in nevada and flowing into lake mead 
currently  muddy river water rights are utilized for agriculture and electricity generation 
at december   vidler owned approximately acre feet of muddy river water rights  and had the right to acquire an additional acre feet 
the southern nevada water authority has been acquiring muddy river water rights as a water resource for future growth 
fish springs ranch during  vidler purchased a interest in fish springs ranch  llc fish springs and a interest in v b  llc 
these companies own the fish springs ranch and other properties totaling approximately  acres in honey lake valley in washoe county  miles north of reno  nevada 
approximately  acre feet of permitted water rights associated with fish springs ranch are transferable to the reno sparks area 
the water rights at fish springs have been identified as the most economical and proven new source of supply to support new growth in the north valley communities of washoe county 
this county was in the top of all counties in the us for new home construction between april  and july  according to census data  almost  new homes were constructed over that month period  a increase 
vidler is holding discussions with a number of potential users for the fish springs water rights  including developers and industrial users 
there is strong demand for water in the north valleys  and few alternative sources of supply 
the future demand of the north valleys area is estimated to exceed  acre feet annually 
if water from fish springs could be supplied to the north valleys  this would reduce their reliance on truckee river water which comes through reno  thereby providing environmental benefits and additional water to support growth in and around reno  an area which has been experiencing consistent growth 
in october  the regional water planning committee accepted the north valley water supply comparison report 
this study re evaluated the feasibility and potential cost of supplying future north valleys water demands with continued exportation of water from the truckee river basin  or  alternatively  meeting the demands from fish springs and two other basins 
the study indicated that groundwater from fish springs would be the most economical source of supply 
alternatively  if the capacity of nearby transmission lines can be expanded  we believe that fish springs ranch would be an attractive site for gas fired electricity generation 
big springs ranch big springs ranch consists of approximately  acres of deeded ranch land  located approximately miles east of elko  nevada  in the northeastern part of the state 
currently the ranch land is leased to farmers  although parts of the property have the potential for a higher and better use 
there are  acre feet of certificated water rights at big springs ranch  which are the only known practical source of water to support new growth for west wendover  nevada and wendover  utah 
in addition  there are  acre feet of permitted water rights related to the ranch  and vidler has filed applications for an additional  acre feet of water rights 
west wendover  nevada in  a land exchange was completed in which approximately  acres of ranchland at big springs ranch was exchanged with the bureau of land management for several parcels of developable land near west wendover  nevada  totaling approximately  acres 
west wendover is adjacent to the nevada utah border in the interstate corridor 
governmental officials are considering a proposal to adjust the state line and then merge the cities of west wendover  nevada and wendover  utah 
west wendover is approximately miles from salt lake city  utah  and attracts a significant number of drive in visitors from utah  a state where gaming is prohibited 
the land owned by vidler will stay in nevada 
the first parcel to be developed is approximately acres of industrial land 
in september  vidler sold acres of unimproved land for  or approximately  per acre  to a developer who is responsible for installing offsite utilities and access road improvements for an industrial park 
we anticipate that these improvements will allow vidler to sell the remaining acres as higher value industrial land 
vidler is examining alternatives for the remaining parcels  including industrial  commercial  hotel casino  and residential development 
colorado vidler has almost completed the process of monetizing its water rights in colorado  through sale or lease 
in  vidler closed the sale of various water rights and related assets to the city of golden  colorado for million  and granted the city options to acquire other water rights over the next years 
the city exercised options to acquire water assets for  in and  in if the remaining options are exercised  the present value of the aggregate purchase price is approximately million 
during  vidler closed on two previously disclosed agreements to sell colorado assets in march  vidler sold its interest in cline ranch to centennial water and sanitation district  which added million to revenues and  to gross margin  and in december  vidler completed the sale of acre feet of water rights to the east dillon water district  which added million to revenues and  to gross margin 
an agreement to sell the wet mountain water rights for approximately  is in escrow  and scheduled to close in discussions are continuing to either lease or sell the remaining water rights in colorado 
water storage vidler arizona recharge facility during  vidler completed the second stage of construction at its facility to bank  or store  water underground in the harquahala valley  and received the necessary permits to operate a full scale water recharge facility 
recharge is the process of placing water into storage underground 
vidler has the permitted right to recharge  acre feet of water per year at the vidler arizona recharge facility  and anticipates being able to store in excess of million acre feet of water in the aquifer underlying much of the valley 
when needed  the water will be recovered  or removed from storage  by ground water wells 
vidler has the only permitted  complete private water storage facility in arizona 
given that arizona is the only southwestern state with surplus flows of water available for storage  we believe that vidler s is the only private water storage facility where it is practical to bank  or store  water for users in other states  which is known as interstate banking 
having a permitted water storage facility also allows vidler to acquire  and store  surplus water for re sale in future years 
the vidler arizona recharge facility is the first privately owned water storage facility for the colorado river system  which is a primary source of water for the lower division states of arizona  california  and nevada 
the water storage facility is strategically located adjacent to the central arizona project cap aqueduct  a conveyance canal running from lake havasu to phoenix and tucson 
the water to be recharged will come from surplus flows of cap water 
we believe that proximity to the cap is a competitive advantage  because it minimizes the cost of water conveyance 
vidler is able to provide storage for users located both within arizona and out of state 
potential users include industrial companies  developers  and local governmental political subdivisions in arizona  and out of state users such as municipalities and water agencies in nevada and california 
the arizona water banking authority awba has the responsibility for intrastate and interstate storage of water for governmental entities 
vidler intends to charge customers a fee based on the amount of water recharged  and then an additional fee when the water is recovered 
the revenues generated from this asset will depend on the quantity of water which the awba  and private users  store at the facility 
the quantity of water stored will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of water and available storage capacity at publicly owned facilities 
we believe that a number of events in recent years have increased the scarcity value of the project s storage capacity 
at a public hearing in march  the awba disclosed that the bureau of reclamation has indicated that  before permits are issued for new facilities to store water for interstate users  extensive environmental impact studies will be required 
the awba also indicated that the first priority for publicly owned storage capacity in arizona is to store water for arizona users 
at the same hearing  the states of california and nevada again confirmed that their demand for storage far exceeds the total amount of storage available at existing facilities in arizona 
consequently  interstate users will need to rely  at least in part  on privately owned storage capacity 
the southern nevada water authority water resource plan  which can be viewed at www 
snwa 
com  calls for million acre feet of water to be stored in arizona in order to meet forecast demand after the awba is currently finalizing agreements to store water on behalf of nevada 
once these agreements have been concluded  the awba can begin to negotiate storage for california 
the awba will be able to store water at existing publicly owned sites and at the vidler arizona recharge facility  which is one of the largest water storage facilities 
vidler has agreed on a price of per acre foot of water recharged in  if any of the users represented by the awba store water at the facility in in addition to the potential demand from the public users represented by the awba  demand from private users could potentially utilize up to of the site s storage capacity 
vidler has not yet stored water for customers at the facility  but the company has been recharging water for its own account since  when the pilot plant was constructed 
vidler purchased the water from the cap  and intends to resell this water at an appropriate time 
at december   vidler has net recharge credits of approximately  acre feet of water at the facility 
once vidler has concluded agreements to store water  it will know the rate at which customers will need to be able to recover water 
at that time  vidler will be able to design  construct  and finance the final stage of the project which will allow full scale recovery 
the users of the facility will bear the capital cost of the improvements required to recover water at commercial rates 
vidler anticipates being able to recharge  acre feet of water per year at the facility  and to store in excess of million acre feet of water in the aquifer 
vidler s estimate of the aquifer s storage volume is primarily based on a hydrological report prepared by an independent engineering firm for the central arizona water conservation district in  which concluded that there is storage capacity of million acre feet 
recharge and recovery capacity is critical  because it indicates how quickly water can be put into storage or recovered from storage 
in wet years  it is important to have a high recharge capacity  so that as much available water as possible may be stored 
in dry years  the crucial factor is the ability to recover water as quickly as possible 
there is a long history of farmers recovering significant quantities of water from the harquahala valley ground water aquifer for irrigation purposes 
semitropic vidler originally had an right to participate in the semitropic water banking and exchange program  which operates a  acre foot water storage facility at semitropic  near the california aqueduct  northwest of bakersfield  california 
the strategic value of the guaranteed right to recover an amount of water from semitropic every year even in drought years became clear to water agencies  developers  and other parties seeking a reliable water supply 
for example  developers of large residential projects in kern county and los angeles county must now be able to demonstrate that they have sufficient back up supplies of water in the case of a drought year before they are permitted to begin development 
accordingly  during  vidler took advantage of current demand for water storage capacity with guaranteed recovery  and began to sell its interest in semitropic 
the strategic value of the guaranteed right to recover water was again highlighted by two court decisions in february which held that developers could not rely on water from state water projects 
in may  vidler closed the sale of of its original interest ie  approximately  acre feet of water storage capacity to the newhall land and farming company for million  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
this transaction added million to revenues and segment income in in september  vidler closed the sale of another of its original interest ie  approximately  acre feet of water storage capacity to the alameda county water district for million  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
this transaction added million to revenues and segment income in vidler s remaining interest includes approximately  acre feet of storage capacity 
we have the guaranteed right to recover a minimum of approximately  acre feet every year 
in some circumstances  we have the right to recover up to approximately  acre feet in any one year 
we are considering various alternatives for the remaining interest  including sale to developers or industrial users 
currently vidler is not storing any water at semitropic for third parties 
vilder is required to make annual payments of  under its agreement with semitropic water storage district 
other projects vidler routinely evaluates the purchase of further water righted properties in arizona and nevada 
vidler also continues to be approached by parties who are interested in obtaining a water supply  or discussing joint ventures to commercially develop water assets and or develop water storage facilities in arizona  nevada  and other states 
nevada land resource company  llc the majority of nevada land s revenues come from the sale of land and water rights 
in addition  various types of recurring revenue are generated from use of the company s lands  including leasing  easements  and mineral royalties 
nevada land also generates interest revenue from land sales contracts where the company has provided partial financing  and from temporary investment of the proceeds of land and water rights sales 
nevada land recognizes revenue from land sales  and the resulting gross profit or loss  when transactions close 
on closing  the entire sales price is recorded as revenue  and a gross margin is recognized depending on the cost basis attributed to the land which was sold 
since the date of closing determines the accounting period in which the sales revenue and gain are recorded  nevada land s reported revenues and income fluctuate from period to period  depending on the dates when specific transactions close 
in  nevada land generated million in revenues from the sale of  acres of former railroad land 
the average sales price of per acre compares to our average basis of per acre in the parcels which were sold  and our average cost of per acre for all of nevada land s land  water  and mineral assets 
in addition  nevada land sold  acre feet of permitted water rights for  as well as acres of surplus land at spring valley ranches for  in  of land sales were settled for cash  and nevada land provided partial financing for the balance 
vendor financing has been collateralized by the land conveyed  typically carries a interest rate  and is subject to a minimum down payment 
business acquisitions and financing this section describes the most significant interests in public companies included in this segment during australian oil gas corporation limited during    and  we accumulated a shareholding in aog  a public company which provides on shore oil rig services in australia and internationally 
in january  aog announced that it was raising additional capital to purchase a new deep capacity drilling rig and to refit two existing rigs to perform new long term drilling contracts with exxonmobil indonesia and petroleum development oman 
we assisted aog with the capital raising  providing the company with a short term us million bridging facility  which was repaid with the proceeds of a rights offering which we partly underwrote 
as compensation we received  common shares of aog valued at  which were issued as fees for establishing the loan facility and underwriting the rights offering in july  pico accepted ensign australia holdings pty 
ltd s cash offer of a us for the aog common shares and a us for the aog options owned by pico 
the sale proceeds were million 
over the life of the investment  pico recorded a total of million in pre tax income and realized gains from aog  including realized gains of million in hyperfeed technologies  inc 
hyperfeed provides financial market data and data delivery solutions to the financial services industry 
pico first invested in hyperfeed in through the purchase of common stock 
we invested further capital in hyperfeed as debt  which was later converted to equity  and received warrants for providing financing 
in and  we further increased our holding through open market purchases and the conversion of preferred stock 
in august  we exercised warrants to buy  new shares of hyperfeed for approximately  or per share  being the average closing bid price on the nasdaq national market for the trading days preceding the exercise date 
pico now owns  hyperfeed common shares  increasing our voting ownership to approximately 
in  hyperfeed generated revenues of million  gross margin of million  and a net loss from operations of million 
net cash flow from operating activities was million 
at december   hyperfeed had million in cash and cash equivalents 
in the fourth quarter of  hyperfeed generated revenues of million  gross margin of million  and a net loss of million 
net cash flow from operating activities was  we use the equity method to account for the common shares 
hyperfeed contributed an equity loss of million to the business acquisitions and financing segment in the equity loss and other events affecting equity recorded in reduced our carrying value of the hyperfeed common shares to pico still holds warrants to buy  shares of hyperfeed common stock at an average price of per share 
at december   the warrants were carried at estimated fair value of  on august   hyperfeed disclosed in a press release that the company s board of directors recently rejected two conditional and non binding offers to purchase hypr at prices that the company felt did not fully recognize the intrinsic value of its technology and the opportunities available for more substantial creation of shareholder value by more aggressively capitalizing on its technological advantages 
during august and september  hyperfeed announced a number of changes to senior management 
on october   hyperfeed announced a series of restructuring measures  including a work force reduction  the consolidation of excess facilities  and a refocusing on profitable business segments  which hyperfeed expected to result in million in annual net expense reductions 
jungfraubahn holding ag pico owns  shares of jungfraubahn  which represents approximately of the company 
at december   the market carrying value of our holding was million 
in september  we acquired  shares for approximately million  and became the largest shareholder in jungfraubahn 
despite the increase in our shareholding to more than  we continue to account for this investment under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
at this time  we do not believe that we have the requisite ability to exercise significant influence over the financial and operating policies of jungfraubahn  and therefore do not apply the equity method of accounting 
in february  jungfraubahn issued a press release containing an initial review of operations  using swiss accounting principles 
the full text is available on jungfraubahn s web site www 
jungfraubahn 
com in the shareholders tab of the inside section 
in the press release  jungfraubahn indicated that it expected transport revenues of approximately chf swiss francs million us million for on a comparable basis  transport revenues declined by chf million us million year over year to approximately chf million us million  however the consolidation of grindelwald first aerial cableway ag bgf for the first time in added transport revenues of approximately chf million us million 
as expected  visitor numbers from japan  jungfraubahn s most important inbound market  and the usa were down significantly  but the shortfall was partly made up by increased numbers of passengers from other countries 
for example  the number of visitors to jungfraujoch top of europe declined year over year 
in addition  domestic passenger numbers were down during the summer season due to prolonged poor weather and the competing attraction of expo 
in september  jungfraubahn announced its results for the six months to june  in the accompanying letter to shareholders  jungfraubahn explained that the results could not be directly compared to the previous year due to the consolidation of bgf for the first time 
reported revenues were chf swiss francs million us million 
ebitda ie  earnings before depreciation  interest  and taxes  a non gaap measure which investors frequently use as a proxy for gross cash flow  as calculated by jungfraubahn was chf million us million  and net income was chf million us million  or approximately chf per share us 
jungfraubahn disclosed that without bgf  passenger revenues would have declined by approximately chf  us 
jungfraubahn announced its results for the financial year on may   so the results will not be released until after this k has been filed 
jungfraubahn s results were the second best in jungfraubahn s history 
revenues were chf million us million  ebitda as calculated by jungfraubahn was chf million us million  and net income was chf million us million  or chf per share us 
jungfraubahn s operating activities generated net cash flow of chf million us million 
in the most recent published balance sheet december  jungfraubahn had book value of approximately chf us per share 
at december   jungfraubahn s stock price was chf us 
other european investments accu holding ag pico owns  shares in accu holding  which represents a voting ownership interest of approximately of the company 
due to a number of factors  we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over accu holding s activities  so the investment is carried at market value under sfas no 
accu holding manufactures batteries at two plants in switzerland 
accu is adjusting its production and cost structure following a decline in demand for batteries during the economic slowdown 
the company is also preparing to redevelop the site of a former factory near zurich  which could have significant value 
over the past years  there has been a protracted downturn in global stock markets  which has affected the stock prices of many publicly traded companies 
according to bloomberg data  during   and  the wilshire index the best known indicator of the performance of the broad us stock market declined by 
as part of our regular review of securities in an unrealized loss position for the year ended december   we have determined that the decline in market value of three unrelated investments in the business acquisitions financing segment is other than temporary 
the total charge recorded is million see business acquisitions and financing segment in results of operations years ended december    and 
by definition  the recording of a charge for other than temporary decline in accordance with gaap does not necessarily mean that we believe that the current decline in value is permanent in economic terms 
a charge for other than temporary impairment is a non cash charge recorded as a realized loss 
the basis of the investment is written down from its original cost to current carrying value  which typically is the market price at the balance sheet date when the provision is recorded 
it should be noted that such charges for other than temporary impairments do not affect book value per share  as the after tax decline in the market value of investments carried under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  is already reflected in shareholders equity in our balance sheet  and the carrying book value of the holding does not change 
the impairment simply reclassifies the decline from an unrealized decrease in shareholders equity to a realized loss in the statement of operations 
the written down value becomes our new basis in the investment 
in future accounting periods  unrealized gains or losses from that level will be recorded in shareholders equity  and when the investment is sold a realized gain or loss from that level will be recorded in the statement of operations 
see results of operations years ended december    and given the recent deterioration in accu holdings core business  and our assessment that there would continue to be downward pressure on accu s stock price in the short to medium term  during we concluded that the decline in accu s market value is other than temporary  primarily due to the extent and duration of the decline in the market value of the security 
we recorded a million pre tax impairment of our investment 
this impairment was recorded as a realized loss and has reduced the basis of the investment to its market carrying value of million at december  this other than temporary impairment did not affect pico s shareholders equity or book value per share 
raetie energie ag pico owns  shares in raetie energie  which is a producer of hydro electricity 
at december   our investment in raetia energie had a basis of million and a market value of million 
sihl in and  we acquired approximately of sihl for million  through participation in a restructuring capital raising and open market purchases 
sihl s core business is digital imaging  but the company has surplus property assets in and around zurich  including a major development project known as sihlcity 
our investment in sihl is accounted for under sfas no 
sihl s operations were adversely affected by the economic downturn in late and  and sihl was unable to improve profitability and reduce debt as previously expected 
in  we recorded a pre tax impairment of million for an other than temporary decline in the market value of this security  primarily due to the extent and duration of the decline in the market value of the security 
during  the stock continued to decline which  combined with an announcement from sihl that a total sale of the company for more than the current market value of the stock was unlikely  caused us to record a further million pre tax impairment for an other than temporary decline 
the impairments have reduced our basis in sihl to  which is equivalent to our carrying market value at december  such other than temporary impairments recorded in and did not affect pico s shareholders equity or book value per share 
insurance operations in run off although run off insurance companies no longer write policies  earned premiums can still arise  for example from policies which were still in force when the company went into run off  or related to reinsurance 
our insurance companies have purchased reinsurance from specialized insurance companies to limit our potential losses on the insurance coverage we have provided to our policyholders 
there are various types of reinsurance contracts  including swing rated contracts  where the premium we pay is adjusted retroactively based on the actual loss experience on the block of business which was reinsured 
under us gaap  if we need to pay for additional reinsurance this is recorded as a reduction in earned premiums  and if reinsurance premiums are returned to us  this is recorded as an increase in earned premiums 
typically most of the revenues of an insurance company in run off come from investment income ie  interest from fixed income securities and dividends from stocks earned on funds held as part of their insurance business 
in addition  from time to time  gains or losses are realized from the sale of investments 
apart from bonds issued by the us treasury and government sponsored enterprises eg  freddie mac and fnma which are held as capital and as deposits or collateral with state regulators  the fixed income component of our insurance company portfolios consists of high grade corporate issues with or less years to maturity 
every bond we own is rated or by the national association of insurance commissioners  which is the equivalent of investment grade from the ratings agencies 
as of december   none of our bond holdings had declined significantly from cost 
we do not own any municipal bonds  or any corporate bonds in the telecommunications  technology  utilities  energy trading  automotive  and consumer finance sectors  and conglomerates which experienced difficulties in and the duration of a bond portfolio measures the amount of time it would take for the cash flows from scheduled interest payments and bond maturities to equal the current value of the portfolio 
duration is an important measure because it indicates the sensitivity of the market value of a bond portfolio to changes in interest rates 
if interest rates increase  the market value of existing bonds will decline 
during periods when market interest rates decline  such as and  the market value of existing bonds increases 
typically  the longer the duration  the greater the sensitivity of the value of the bond portfolio to changes in interest rates 
the maturity of securities in citation s bond portfolio is structured to match the projected pattern of claims payouts 
at december   the duration of citation s bond portfolio was years  and the duration of the physicians bond portfolio was years 
a duration of years is generally regarded as medium term 
the equities portion of the insurance company portfolios primarily consists of positions in a limited number of small capitalization value stocks in the us these positions have been accumulated at a significant discount to our estimate of the private market value of each company s underlying hard assets ie  land and other tangible assets 
to a lesser extent  the insurance companies buy smaller interests in fundamentally undervalued stocks with high dividend yields  in the us and selected foreign markets 
dividends and realized gains or losses from stocks held in the insurance company portfolios are reported in the insurance operations in run off segment and in the case of sequoia  in discontinued operations 
the investment income  and therefore revenue  of a run off insurance company is expected to decline over time as fixed income investments mature or are sold to provide the funds to pay down the company s claims reserves 
unless there is adverse development in prior year loss reserves  typically the expenses of an insurance company in run off will be lower than the expenses of an insurance company which is actively writing business 
physicians insurance company of ohio physicians wrote its last policy in  however  claims can be filed until resulting from events allegedly occurring during the period when physicians provided coverage 
by its nature  medical professional liability insurance involves a relatively small number frequency of relatively large severity claims 
we have purchased excess of loss reinsurance to limit our potential losses 
the amount of risk we have retained on each claim varies depending on the accident year but  in general  we are liable for the first million to million per claim 
due to the long tail ie  period of time between the occurrence of the alleged event giving rise to the claim  and the claim being reported to us in the medical professional liability insurance business  it is difficult to accurately quantify future claims liabilities and establish appropriate loss reserves 
our loss reserves are adjusted in the fourth quarter of each year  based on independent actuarial analysis of past  current  and projected claims trends in the months ended september of each year 
the actuarial study is carried out annually  as data for a shorter period would be insufficient to form valid estimates 
at december   medical professional liability reserves totaled million  net of reinsurance  compared to million net of reinsurance at december   and million net of reinsurance at december  physicians insurance company of ohio loss and loss adjustment expense reserves year ended december  direct reserves million million million ceded reserves net medical professional liability insurance reserves million million million at december   our direct reserves  or reserves before reinsurance  essentially equaled the independent actuary s best estimate 
the independent actuary is continually reviewing our claims experience and projected claims trends in order to arrive at the most accurate estimate possible 
the independent actuary did not explicitly forecast a range of reserves  but arrived at a best estimate through weighting the results of five different projection methods for each accident year  and in total 
under the different projection methods  the lowest direct reserve calculation was approximately million  and the highest direct reserve calculation was million 
consequently  our loss reserves could be materially different depending on the particular method of calculation chosen 
changes in assumptions about future claims trends and the cost of handling claims can lead to significant increases and decreases in our loss reserves 
when loss reserves are reduced  this is referred to as favorable development 
if loss reserves are increased  the development is adverse 
at december   approximately million  or of our direct reserves were case reserves  which are the loss reserves established when a claim is reported to us 
our provision for ibnr claims ie  the event giving rise to the claim has allegedly occurred  but the claim has not been reported to us were million  or of our direct reserves 
the loss adjustment expense reserves  totaling million  or of direct reserves  recognize the cost of handling claims over the next years while the physicians loss reserves run off 
over the past years  the trends in open claims and claims paid have been year ended december  open claims at the start of the year new claims reported during the year claims closed during the year open claims at the end of the year total claims closed during the year claims closed with no indemnity payment claims closed with an indemnity payment net indemnity payments    net loss adjustment expense payments    total claims payments during the year    average indemnity payment    during  our medical professional liability insurance claims reserves  net of reinsurance  decreased from million to million 
claims payments for the year were approximately million  accounting for of the net decrease in reserves during due to continued favorable trends in the severity size of claims  and  to a lesser extent  the frequency number of claims  independent actuarial analysis of physicians loss reserves as of september  concluded that physicians reserves against claims were greater than the actuary s projections of future claims payments 
reserves were increased in of physicians accident years from until by million  and reduced in the other accident years by million  resulting in a net reduction of approximately million  or of reserves at the start of the year 
the net reduction in reserves of approximately million was primarily a product of the following factors due to a decrease in claims severity  physicians reduced its reserve for ibnr claims by approximately million  this was partially offset by a million increase in the provision for unallocated loss adjustment expense  which effectively recognized the cost of handling physicians claims over the remaining run off  and in addition  two adjustments related to reinsurance had a net effect of  an increase in ceded reserves of  and a decrease in reserves related to retroactive reinsurance of  there were no changes in key actuarial assumption in it should be noted that such actuarial analyses involves estimation of future trends in many factors which may vary significantly from expectation  which could lead to further reserve adjustments either increases or decreases in future years 
see critical accounting policies and risk factors 
the decline in severity is illustrated by the average indemnity payment declining from approximately  in to approximately  in we are currently projecting further decreases in severity in future years at december   the average case reserve per open claim was approximately physicians insurance company of ohio change in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves year ended december  beginning reserves million million million accounting change no longer discounting loss loss adjustment expense payments re estimation of prior year loss reserves net medical professional liability insurance reserves million million million re estimation as a percentage of undiscounted beginning reserves during  our medical professional liability insurance claims reserves  net of reinsurance  decreased from million to million 
claims payments for the year were million  accounting for of the net decrease in reserves during actuarial analysis of physicians loss reserves as of september  concluded that physicians reserves against claims were significantly greater than the actuary s projections of future claims payments in of accident years  due to favorable trends in both the frequency and severity of claims 
consequently  physicians reduced its reserve for ibnr claims by approximately million  which accounted for the remaining of the net decrease in reserves for the year 
there was a change in a key actuarial assumption in when estimating the reserves required for losses greater than  per claim  the independent actuary began to use physicians own claims experience  rather than industry averages 
since physicians own experience had been less severe than the industry averages  the actuary reduced the reserves required for losses in excess of  per claim  which contributed to the reduction in reserves 
in reaching the best estimate  the appointed actuary also took note of both a decrease in the number of open claims  and favorable development in known claims during in  our medical professional liability insurance claims reserves  net of reinsurance  decreased from million to million 
an accounting change  implemented as of january   eliminated the discounting of loss reserves  which increased reserves by million  to million 
claims payments for the year were million 
actuarial analysis of physicians loss reserves as of september  concluded that physicians direct reserves contained approximately million in redundancy  however  this was more than offset by million of redundancy in reserves ceded to our reinsurance companies 
consequently  physicians increased reserves by approximately million 
there were no changes to key actuarial assumptions in since it is almost seven years since physicians wrote its last policy  and the direct ibnr claims reserve at december  is million  it is conceivable that further favorable development could be recorded in future years if claims trends remain favorable  particularly claims severity 
however  we caution that claims can be reported until  and against over emphasizing claims count statistics for example  the last claims to be resolved by a run off insurance company could be the most complex and the most severe 
citation insurance company citation went into run off from january  at december   after two years of run off  citation had million in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves after reinsurance 
approximately of citation s reserves are related to one line of business  artisans contractors liability insurance 
the remaining relate to the remaining lines of commercial property and casualty insurance business 
the last of citation s commercial property and casualty insurance policies expired in as a general rule  based on state statutes of limitations  we believe that new commercial property and casualty insurance claims can be filed in arizona until the end of  but no new commercial property and casualty insurance claims can be filed in california 
however  in certain limited circumstances  claims filing periods may be extended 
we have purchased excess of loss reinsurance to limit our potential losses 
the amount of risk we have retained on each claim varies depending on the accident year  but we can be liable for the first  to  per claim 
citation wrote artisans contractors insurance until  the year before physicians merged with citation s parent company 
no artisans contractors business was renewed after the merger 
artisans contractors liability insurance has been a problematic line of business for all insurers who offered this type of coverage in california during the s and s 
california experienced a severe recession in the early s  which caused a steep downturn in real estate values 
in an attempt to improve their position  many homeowners filed claims against developers of new home communities and condominiums  and related parties such as general contractors  for alleged construction defects 
citation s average loss ratio ie  the cost of making provision to pay claims as a percentage of earned premium for all years from to for this insurance coverage is over 
the nature of this line of business is that we receive a large number high frequency of small low severity claims 
citation primarily insured subcontractors  and only rarely insured general contractors 
a large percentage of the claims received in related to additional insured endorsements aie 
in general  these represent claims from general contractors who were not direct policyholders of citation s  but were named as insureds on policies issued to the company s subcontractor policyholders 
most of citation s subcontractor insureds are not initially named as defendants in construction defect law suits  but are drawn into litigation against general contractors  typically when the general contractor s legal expenses reach the limit of their own insurance policy 
the courts have held that subcontractors who performed only a minor role in the construction can be held in on complicated litigation against general contractors 
accordingly  the cost of legal defenses can be as significant as claims payments 
typically aei claims are shared among more than one subcontractor and more than one insurance carrier 
this reduces the expense to any one carrier  so aei claims typically involve smaller claims payments than claims from actual policyholders 
since citation sets an initial case reserve of  on most claims received  and many aie claims are closed for a smaller amount  citation experienced favorable loss development in citation s independent actuary has assumed that the reporting of new artisan contractors claims has peaked  and that new claims will decline in future years 
although citation wrote its last artisans contractors policy in and the statute of limitations in california is years  this can be extended in some situations 
over the past years  the trends in open claims and claims paid in the artisans contractors line of business has been year ended december  open claims at the start of the year new claims reported during the year claims closed during the year open claims at the end of the year total claims closed during the year claims closed with no payment claims closed with lae payment only no indemnity payment claims closed with an indemnity payment due to the long tail ie  period between the occurrence of the alleged event giving rise to the claim and the claim being reported to us in the artisans contractors line of business  it is difficult to accurately quantify future claims liabilities and establish appropriate loss reserves 
our loss reserves are reviewed at september and december of each year by an independent actuary who issues an opinion annually  as required by california state law 
the independent actuary analyzes past  current  and projected claims trends for all active accident years  using several forecasting methods 
the appointed actuary believes this will result in more accurate reserve estimates than using a single method 
we typically book our reserves to the actuary s best estimate  or above the actuary s best estimate 
changes in assumptions about future claims trends and the cost of handling claims can lead to significant increases and decreases in our loss reserves 
due to the large number of claims received in the artisans contractors line of business in   and  citation was forced to increase its reserves in each of those years 
citation reduced claims reserves by  in  increased reserves by  in  and reduced reserves by  in in  the change in reserves was less than of total reserves at the start of the relevant year 
in and  the reserve changes were less than of beginning reserves 
there have been no changes in key actuarial assumptions during   and see critical accounting policies and risk factors 
at december   citation s net reserves were carried at million  approximately million more than the actuary s best estimate 
given the uncertainties inherent in projecting claims trends in the artisans contractors line of business  we elected to set higher reserves than the actuary s best estimate  to partially guard against unexpected reserve increases in future years if claims experience deteriorates 
consequently  if current claims trends continue  it is conceivable that favorable development could be recorded in future years 
citation insurance company loss and loss adjustment expense reserves december  december  december  direct reserves million million million ceded reserves net reserves million million million at december   million of citation s reserves approximately were case reserves  million of citation s reserves represented provision for ibnr claims  and the unallocated loss adjustment expense reserve was million 
the change in citation s reserves over the past years has resulted from citation insurance company change in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves year ended december  beginning reserves million million million loss loss adjustment expense payments incurred loss loss adjustment expense payments for current year re estimation of prior year loss reserves net property casualty insurance reserves million million million re estimation as a percentage of beginning reserves during  citation s property and casualty insurance claims reserves  net of reinsurance  decreased from million to million 
claims payments for the year were million  accounting for approximately of the net decrease in reserves during actuarial analysis of citations loss reserves as of december  continued to show a redundancy in the carried reserves of citation  which we reduced during by  the reserve redundancy reflects the reduction in the severity size of claims described in preceding paragraphs 
during  citation s property and casualty insurance claims reserves  net of reinsurance  decreased from million to million 
claims payments for prior years reduced reserves by million  and essentially accounted for the net reduction in reserves for the year 
this was partially offset by  in incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses for the accident year  consisting of paid losses of  and additions to reserves of  a  increase in prior year loss reserves was recorded 
in  citation s property and casualty insurance claims reserves  net of reinsurance  decreased from million to million 
claims payments for prior years reduced reserves by million  which led to the net reduction in reserves for the year 
this was partially offset by million in incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses for the accident year  consisting of paid losses of  and additions to reserves of  favorable development of  was recorded in prior year loss reserves 
it should be noted that such actuarial analyses involves estimation of future trends in many factors which may vary significantly from expectation  which could lead to further reserve adjustments either increases or decreases in future years 
discontinued operations sequoia insurance company in  sequoia generated direct written premiums of million  a increase from the previous year  primarily due to a increase in the average premium per commercial policy 
the increase in average premium per commercial policy resulted from various initiatives introduced by sequoia s management to improve the company s underwriting results following disappointing loss ratios in and these initiatives included a further tightening in underwriting standards  and rate increases in most commercial lines 
the operating performance of insurance companies is frequently analyzed using their combined ratio 
a combined ratio below indicates that the insurance company made a profit on its base insurance business  prior to investment income  realized gains or losses  taxes  extraordinary items  and other non insurance items 
during our ownership  sequoia managed its business with the aim of having a combined ratio of less than each year  although this was not always achieved 
sequoia s combined ratios on a gaap basis for the past years were sequoia s gaap industry ratios loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio for  sequoia s combined ratio was  compared to in  and in sequoia s loss and loss adjustment expense ratio ie  the cost of making provision to pay claims as a percentage of earned premiums was in  in  and in the relatively high loss ratios in and were caused by claims costs having risen faster than premium rates 
the increase in average premium per commercial policy described in preceding paragraphs helped to restore underwriting margins  and contributed to the improved loss ratio in sequoia s underwriting expense ratio ie  operating expenses as a percentage of earned premiums was in  compared to in  and in the progressive reduction in the underwriting expense ratio was primarily due to economies of scale 
sequoia s earned premiums grew by in and in as fixed underwriting expense items ie  expenses which do not change with volume were spread over a larger base of revenue  these expenses declined as a percentage of earned premium 
sequoia insurance company loss and loss adjustment expense reserves december  december  december  direct reserves million million million ceded reserves net reserves million million million given the short reporting tail with the type of property and casualty insurance business written by sequoia  changes in prior year loss reserves tend to represent a small percentage of the company s total reserves 
critical accounting policies pico s principal assets and activities comprise vidler water company and nevada land resource company s land  water rights  and water storage operations  property and casualty insurance operations  and the run off of property and casualty insurance and medical professional liability insurance loss reserves  and business acquisitions and financing 
following is a description of what we believe to be the critical accounting policies affecting our company  and how we apply these policies 
estimation of reserves in insurance companies we must estimate future claims and ensure that our loss reserves are adequate to pay those claims 
this process requires us to make estimates about future events 
the accuracy of these estimates will not be known for many years 
for example  part of our claims reserves cover ibnr claims ie  the event giving rise to the claim has occurred  but the claim has not been reported to us 
in other words  in the case of ibnr claims  we must provide for claims which we do not know about yet 
at december   the loss reserves  net of reinsurance  of our three insurance subsidiaries were citation insurance company  million  physicians insurance company of ohio  million 
physicians wrote its last policy in however  under current law  claims can be made until for events which allegedly occurred during the periods when we provided insurance coverage to medical professionals  and sequoia insurance company  million 
our medical professional liability insurance reserves are certified annually by an independent actuary  as required by ohio insurance law 
actuarial estimates of our future claims obligations have been volatile 
in  there was a million net reduction after independent actuarial studies concluded that physicians claims reserves were greater than projected claims payments  and in  we reduced claims reserves by million 
however  based on independent actuarial analysis  we increased reserves by million in accordingly  there can be no assurance that our claims reserves are adequate and there will not be reserve increases or decreases in the future 
as required by california insurance law  the loss reserves of citation insurance company and sequoia insurance company are reviewed quarterly  and certified annually  by an independent actuarial firm 
see insurance operations in run off  and discontinued operations on preceding pages in item carrying value of long lived assets our principal long lived assets are land  water rights  and interests in water storage operations owned by vidler  and land at nevada land 
at december   the total carrying value of land  water rights  and interests in water storage assets was million  or of pico s total assets 
as required by gaap  our long lived assets are reviewed regularly to ensure that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from these assets will at least recover their carrying value 
our management conducts these reviews utilizing the most recent information available  however  the review process inevitably involves the significant use of estimates and assumptions 
in our water rights and water storage business  we develop some projects and assets from scratch 
this can require cash outflows eg  to drill wells to prove that water is available in situations where there is no guarantee that the project will ultimately be commercially viable 
if we determine that it is probable that the project will be commercially viable  the costs of developing the asset are capitalized ie  recorded as an asset in our balance sheet  rather than being charged as an expense 
if the project ends up being viable  in the case of a sale  the capitalized costs are included in the cost of land and water rights sold and applied against the purchase price 
in the case of a lease transaction or when the asset is fully developed and ready for use  the capitalized costs are amortized ie  charged as an expense in our income statement and match any related revenues 
if we determine that the carrying value of an asset cannot be justified by the forecast future cash flows of that asset  the carrying value of the asset is written down to fair value immediately 
accounting for investments and investments in unconsolidated affiliates at december   pico and its subsidiaries held equities with a carrying value of approximately million excluding equities held by sequoia in discontinued operations 
these holdings are primarily small capitalization value stocks listed in the us  switzerland  and new zealand 
depending on the circumstances  and our judgment about the level of our involvement with the investee company  we apply one of two accounting policies 
in the case of most holdings  we apply statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
under this method  the investment is carried at market value in our balance sheet  with unrealized gains or losses being included in shareholders equity  and the only income recorded is from dividends 
in the case of investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the company we have invested in  we apply the equity method under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the application of the equity method apb no 
to an investment may result in a different outcome in our financial statements than market value accounting sfas no 

the most significant difference between the two policies is that  under the equity method  we include our proportionate share of the investee s earnings or losses in our statement of operations  and dividends received are used to reduce the carrying value of the investment in our balance sheet 
under market value accounting  the only income recorded is dividends 
the assessment of what constitutes the ability to exercise significant influence requires our management to make significant judgments 
we look at various factors in making this determination 
these include our percentage ownership of voting stock  whether or not we have representation on the investee company s board of directors  transactions between us and the investee  the ability to obtain timely quarterly financial information  and whether pico management can affect the operating and financial policies of the investee company 
when we conclude that we have this kind of influence  we adopt the equity method and change all of our previously reported results of the investee to show the investment as if we had applied equity accounting from the date of our first purchase 
this adds volatility to our reported results 
while the method of accounting we use clearly has no impact on the underlying economic performance of the investee  the use of market value accounting or the equity method can result in significantly different carrying values at specific balance sheet dates  and contributions to our statement of operations over the course of the investment 
the total impact of the investment on pico s shareholders equity over the entire life of the investment will be the same whichever method is adopted 
for equity and debt securities accounted for under sfas no 
which are in an unrealized loss position  we regularly review whether the decline in market value is other than temporary 
in general  this review requires management to consider several factors  including specific adverse conditions affecting the investee s business and industry  the financial condition of the investee  the long term prospects of the investee  and the extent and duration of the decline in market value of the investee 
accordingly  management has to make important assumptions regarding our intent and ability to hold the security  and our assessment of the overall worth of the security 
risks and uncertainties in our methodology for reviewing unrealized losses for other than temporary declines include our judgments regarding the overall worth of the issuer and its long term prospects  and our ability to realize on our assessment of the overall worth of the business 
in a subsequent quarterly review  if we conclude that an unrealized loss previously determined to be temporary is other than temporary  an impairment loss will be recorded 
the other than temporary impairment charge will have no impact on our financial condition or book value per share  as the decline in market value has already been recorded through shareholders equity 
however  there will be an impact on our net income before and after tax and on our reported earnings per share  due to recognition of the unrealized loss and tax effects 
when a charge for other than temporary impairment is recorded  our basis in the security is decreased 
consequently  if the market value of the security later recovers and we sell the security  a correspondingly greater gain will be recorded in the statement of operations 
these accounting treatments add volatility to our statements of operations 
revenue recognition revenue on the sale of land  water  and water rights is recognized in full when a there is a legally binding sale contract  b the profit is determinable ie  the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured  or any amount that will not be collectible can be estimated  c the earnings process is virtually complete ie  we are not obliged to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit  meaning we have transferred all risks and rewards to the buyer  and d the buyer s initial and continuing investment are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property 
if these conditions are not met  we use the deposit method of accounting 
under the deposit method of accounting  until the conditions to fully recognize a sale are met  payments by the buyer are recorded as liabilities and no gain is recognized 
results of operations years ended december    and shareholders equity at december   pico had shareholders equity of million per share  compared to million per share as restated at the end of  and million per share as restated at the end of book value per share increased by in  and in the principal factors leading to the million increase in shareholders equity were the million net income and net movements of million in unrealized appreciation in investments and million in foreign currency translation 
in addition   of new capital was subscribed to exercise options 
these factors were partially offset by a  increase in treasury stock due to the purchase of pico shares in deferred compensations plans for directors and employees 
balance sheet total assets at december  were million  compared to million at december  most of the million increase in total assets is attributable to an increase in sequoia s investment portfolio related to growth in that company s book of business  and an increase in the value of equity and fixed income securities 
total liabilities increased by million  primarily due to an increase in sequoia s claims reserves related to growth in that company s book of business  which was partially offset by a reduction in the reserves of our insurance operations in run off  physicians and citation 
at december   on a consolidated basis  available for sale equity securities showed a net unrealized gain of million after tax 
this total consists of approximately million in gains  partially offset by  in losses 
no individual equity security had an unrealized loss  net of tax  of more than  accounting for discontinued operations as sequoia is now accounted for as a discontinued operation  under gaap the presentation of sequoia s income  assets and liabilities  and cash flow in our financial statements for all years in this k has changed in our consolidated statements of operations  sequoia s after tax income is now recorded in one line  income from discontinued operations  net 
consequently  sequoia s revenues  expenses  and pre tax income are no longer reported separately  and are not included in the following segmental analysis  in the consolidated balance sheet  sequoia s assets are grouped in the lines investments held by discontinued operations and other assets of discontinued operations  and its liabilities are combined in the lines unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of discontinued operations and other liabilities of discontinued operations  and in the consolidated statements of cash flows  sequoia s cash flow is reported in one line in each category of cash flow 
net income loss pico reported net income of million  or per diluted share in  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share in  and a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the million net income reported in consisted of an million net income before a change in accounting principle  or per share  and a change in accounting principle which increased income by million after tax  or per share 
from january   pico adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually rather than amortized over time 
the million in net income recognized reflected the surplus of negative goodwill arising from the reverse merger of physicians and citation insurance group now known as pico holdings  inc over the write off of goodwill items which were determined to be impaired 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle  and the insurance operations in run off segment 
the million in net income before a change in accounting principle was comprised of income of million before taxes and minority interest from continuing operations  a million income tax expense  the addition of  in minority interest  which reflects the interest of outside shareholders in the losses of subsidiaries which are less than owned by pico  and income from discontinued operations ie  sequoia of million after tax and a change in accounting principle 
the million tax expense for consists of several items  which are detailed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  federal  foreign and state income tax 
we do not need to pay any federal taxes in cash for because prior year net operating loss carry forwards offset our tax provision for the year  however we have provided for the payment of approximately  in state income taxes 
in  pico generated million in net income  consisting of million in net income before a change in accounting principle  or per share  and a change in accounting principle which reduced income by  after tax  or per share 
the change in accounting principle resulted from the adoption of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this non cash charge recognized the accumulated after tax decline in the estimated fair value of warrants we own to buy shares in other companies principally hyperfeed technologies  inc from the date we acquired the warrants through to january  the decline in the estimated fair value of warrants during is recorded in the business acquisitions and financing segment 
the million in net income before a change in accounting principle was comprised of million in income before taxes and minority interest  a million provision for income tax expense  the addition of  in minority interest  and income from discontinued operations ie  sequoia of million after tax 
a gross provision for tax of approximately million was partially offset by  in tax benefits  primarily represented by a cash refund following a successful appeal of a prior year tax ruling in canada 
we did not pay any taxes in cash for because prior year net operating loss carry forwards offset our tax provision for the year 
pico incurred a net loss of million in the million net loss before an accounting change consisted of a million pre tax loss  which was partially offset by million in income tax benefits and the addition of  in minority interest 
income from discontinued operations was  in addition  the cumulative effect of an accounting change reduced income by million after tax 
until december   pico had discounted the carrying value of its medical professional liability claims reserves  to reflect the fact that some claims will not be paid until many years in the future  but funds from the corresponding premiums can be invested in the meantime 
after december   pico s medical professional liability insurance subsidiaries were no longer allowed to discount claims reserves in the statements they file with the ohio department of insurance  which are prepared on the statutory basis of accounting 
with this change in accounting principle  we eliminated the discounting in our financial statements which are prepared on a gaap basis 
the million in tax benefits recorded in is made up of several items 
these include a million cash refund resulting from the successful appeal of a prior year tax ruling in canada  and a million expense which was recognized to increase federal income tax valuation allowances recorded against tax assets in some of our subsidiaries 
comprehensive income in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income  pico reports comprehensive income as well as net income from the consolidated statement of operations 
comprehensive income includes items resulting in unrealized changes in shareholders equity  such as foreign currency translation and change in unrealized investment gains and losses on available for sale securities 
over the past three years  pico has recorded comprehensive income of million in  primarily consisting of the million net income and movements of million in net unrealized appreciation in investments and million in foreign currency translation  comprehensive income of million in  consisting of net income of million and a movement of million in net unrealized appreciation in investments  which were partially offset by a  reduction in foreign currency translation  and a million comprehensive loss in this was comprised of the million net loss  and movements of million in net unrealized change in investments and foreign currency translation of million 
operating revenues year ended december  vidler water company    nevada land resource company    business acquisitions and financing    insurance operations in run off    total revenues    in  total revenues were million  compared to million in  and million in revenues in were million higher than in revenues were million higher in business acquisitions and financing and million higher at nevada land  but million lower at vidler and million lower in the insurance operations in run off segment 
in  revenues were million higher than in  principally due to million higher revenues from vidler 
the most significant items in the revenue growth at vidler were revenues of million from the sale of water rights and land in the harquahala valley  and million from pre tax gains on the sale of interests in semitropic 
during  revenues were reduced by charges for other than temporary impairment in three unrelated equity securities of million 
the other than temporary impairment charges were calculated as the difference between the investment s original basis and the current carrying value ie  market value 
total expenses in were million  compared to million in  and million in the largest expense item in each of the past three years was the cost of land and water rights sold million in  compared to million in  and million in the increase in expenses in from is primarily attributable to reduced favorable development in the claims reserves of the run off insurance operations 
favorable reserve development is recorded as a reduction in expenses 
income loss before taxes and minority interest year ended december  vidler water company    nevada land resource company    business acquisitions and financing    insurance operations in run off    income loss before taxes and minority interest    the principal items in the million in income before taxes and minority interest in were vidler incurred an  pre tax loss on million in revenues 
vidler closed on two sales of water rights and land in the harquahala valley irrigation district  which added million to revenues and million to gross margin 
in addition  vidler closed on two previously announced sales of water rights in colorado which contributed million in revenues and approximately  in gross margin 
the gross margin on these water rights sales was more than offset by vidler s on going operating expenses and the costs of developing water assets which will not be monetized until future years  income of  from nevada land on revenues of million  which included million from the sale of land and water rights  a million loss before taxes from business acquisitions and financing 
this was primarily comprised of an million realized gain on the sale of aog common stock and options  which was more than offset by parent company overhead of million and million in impairment charges for other than temporary declines in the market value of investments 
such other than temporary charges do not affect shareholders equity  or book value per share  and million in income from insurance operations in run off  consisting of a million pre tax profit from citation and a million pre tax profit from physicians 
vidler water company  inc 
year ended december  revenues sale of land  water rights  water    gain on sale of semitropic water storage interests  lease of water    lease of agricultural land    other    segment total revenues    expenses cost of land  water rights  water sold    commission and other cost of sales   depreciation amortization    interest    operations  maintenance other    segment total expenses    income loss before tax    most of the water rights and water storage operations acquired by vidler since we entered the water business have been development stage assets which were not ready for immediate commercial use 
although vidler began to generate significant revenues from the sale of water rights in  the segment is still incurring costs related to long lived assets which will not generate revenues until future years  eg  operating  maintenance  and amortization expenses at storage facilities which are not yet storing water for customers 
vidler generated total revenues of million in  compared to million in  and million in in  vidler generated million in revenues from the sale of water rights and land 
this primarily represented four transactions  which generated million in revenues the sale of  acre feet of transferable ground water and  acres of land in the harquahala valley irrigation district to golf course developers near scottsdale  arizona 
this transaction added million to revenues and million to gross margin  the sale of acre feet of water rights and acres of land in the hvid to a unit of allegheny energy  inc  which added million to revenues and  to gross margin  and two sales of water rights in colorado cline ranch to centennial water and sanitation district  which added million to revenues and  in gross margin  and acre feet of water rights to the city of east dillon  which added million to revenues and  to gross margin 
in addition  vidler sold acres of unimproved land near west wendover  nevada for  which contributed  to gross margin 
in  vidler s results were dominated by three transactions  which generated million in revenues the sale of  acre feet of transferable ground water and  acres of land in arizona s harquahala valley irrigation district to a unit of allegheny energy  inc this transaction added million to revenues  comprised of the million sales price and a  option fee earned  and contributed million to segment income  the sale of of vidler s original interest in the semitropic water banking and exchange program ie  approximately  acre feet of storage capacity  out of the original  acre feet for million 
this transaction added million to revenues and to segment income  and another sale of of vidler s original interest in the semitropic water banking and exchange program ie  approximately  acre feet of storage capacity for million 
this transaction added million to revenues and to segment income

this was primarily a result of professional fees related to various legal issues and water rights applications in nevada  including the  acre feet of water rights in the tule desert groundwater basin permitted in segment operating expenses decreased  in from  primarily as a result of decreases of  in interest expense and  in operations  maintenance  and other expenses  which were partially offset by  higher depreciation and amortization charges 
interest expense declined due to the repayment of the non recourse debt on the harquahala valley farm properties which were sold during the year 
the decrease in operations and maintenance expense was primarily due to a lower obligation to contribute to operations and maintenance expense at the semitropic water storage facility  as our interest in the asset reduced 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the start of amortization of improvements at the vidler arizona recharge facility 
since construction of the improvements required to recharge water was complete and the facility was ready for use  from march  vidler began to amortize the improvements at the facility over years 
the annual amortization charge will be approximately  and the charge for was  vidler recorded a segment loss of  in  compared to segment income of million in  and a segment loss of million in the segment result decreased million from to  primarily due to the million in gains from the sale of interests in semitropic recorded in  which did not recur in the principal causes of the million improvement in the segment result from to were the contributions to income of million from the sale of interests in semitropic  million from the allegheny transaction  and  from the easement granted in nevada land resource company  llc year ended december  revenues sale of land    sale of water rights   gain on land exchange  lease and royalty    interest and other    segment total revenues    expenses cost of land and water rights sold    operating expenses    segment total expenses    income before tax    nevada land generated revenues of million in  compared to million in  and million in most of the variation in revenue from year to year is caused by fluctuations in the level of land sales

in  segment expenses included a  write down of nevada land s interest in silver state land  llc  an entity which had filed applications for approximately  acre feet of water rights in various locations geographically unrelated to nevada land s properties 
since our priority is to first pursue the water rights applications filed by lincoln vidler and by nevada land on its own properties  due to the uncertainty of realizing the value of these applications we reduced the carrying value of silver state to zero 
the silver state water rights applications were the only water rights applications with a carrying value in our financial statements 
nevada land recorded income of  in  compared to  in and million in the  increase in segment income from to is primarily due to the higher gross margin on land sales and the contribution from the water rights sale  which exceeded the increase in operating expenses discussed in the preceding paragraph

holdings are not sold on a regular basis  but when the price of an individual security has significantly exceeded our target  or if there have been changes which we believe limit further appreciation potential on a risk adjusted basis 
consequently  the amount of net realized gains or losses recognized during any accounting period has no predictive value 
a net realized gain of million was recognized in this principally consisted of a million gain on the sale of our common shares in aog  which was partially offset by a million charge for other than temporary impairment of our investment in sihl see the sihl section of the company summary  recent developments and future outlook portion of item  a million charge for other than temporary impairment of our investment in accu holding see the accu holding section of the company summary  recent developments and future outlook portion of item  a  charge for other than temporary impairment of our investment in solpower corporation 
solpower is a development stage company  which was one of the final alternative investments discussed in item given the duration of the decline in value in this stock and the absence of factors indicating otherwise  we determined that the decline is other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded a charge to reduce the basis of the investment to zero at december  none of the other than temporary impairments affect shareholders equity or book value per share

in addition  although this did not affect the segment  a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle reduced income by  to reflect the after tax decline in the estimated fair value of warrants during the period from the acquisition of the various warrants through to december  in  a net realized loss of million was incurred 
this primarily represented a million loss on the sale of conex  a million write down of the loan to mkg enterprises  and a  loss when a former employee exercised an option which required pico to sell existing shares in vidler for less than current book value 
when pico acquired vidler in the merger with global equity corporation  call options had already been granted to certain employees over existing shares in vidler 
all of these call options have now been exercised

segment expenses include the accrual of million in incentive compensation  other parent company overhead of million  and siscom expenses of million 
segment expenses were reduced by a million benefit resulting from the effect of appreciation in the swiss franc on an inter company loan during our interests in swiss public companies are held by global equity sa  a wholly owned subsidiary which is incorporated in switzerland 
part of global equity sa s funding comes from a loan from pico  which is denominated in swiss francs 
during accounting periods when the swiss franc appreciates relative to the us dollar such as the year under gaap we are required to record a benefit through the statement of operations to reflect the fact that global equity sa owes pico more us dollars 
in global equity sa s financial statements  an equivalent debit is included in the foreign currency translation component of shareholders equity since it owes pico more dollars  however  this does not go through the statement of operations 
during accounting periods when the swiss franc depreciates relative to the us dollar  opposite entries are made and an expense is recorded in the statement of operations 
accordingly  we were required to record a benefit of million in our statement of operations in  even though there was no net impact on shareholders equity

once an insurance company has gone into run off and the last of its policies has expired  typically most revenues will come from investment income 
however  even when an insurance company is in run off  earned premium can arise 
for example  with swing rated reinsurance  the reinsurance premiums we pay are recalculated based on actual loss experience ie  the number and size of claims 
under gaap  if we required to pay for additional reinsurance this is recorded as a reduction in the earned premium line  while a reduction in the amount of reinsurance we need to pay is recorded as an increase in earned premiums

investment income was  in  million in  and million in investment income varies from year to year  depending on the amount of fixed income securities held in the portfolio and the prevailing level of interest rates 
physicians recorded earned premiums of  in  compared to  in  and million in  representing a reduction in the amount of reinsurance that we need to pay on swing rated contracts 
the reduced reinsurance requirement resulted from the reduction in ibnr reserves 
in  physicians recorded a million underwriting recovery 
the million net reduction in reserves and a  benefit related to reinsurance more than offset regular loss and loss adjustment expense and operating expenses of  for the year 
the  benefit represented the final amortization of a deferred gain resulting from a reinsurance contract entered into in  where the gain was deferred and recognized as the related reinsurance recoveries occurred 
the changes in reserves are more fully explained in the physicians section of the company summary  recent developments  and future outlook portion of item in  the segment reported a million underwriting recovery  which resulted in segment income of million 
in  after underwriting expenses of million  which included a million net increase in reserves  segment income of  was recorded 
in addition  reserves increased by million due to the elimination of reserve discount included in the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

until the end of  we discounted our medical professional liability claims reserves to reflect the fact that some claims will not be paid until future years  but funds from the corresponding premiums can be invested in the meantime

when citation insurance group acquired physicians in the reverse merger in  a million negative goodwill item arose because the fair value of the assets acquired ie  physicians exceeded the cost of the investment ie  the fair value of the shares in citation issued to physicians shareholders 
the negative goodwill was being recognized as income over a period of years in this segment 
on january   pico adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be tested for impairment annually rather than amortized over time 
as a result of adopting this standard  the remaining negative goodwill of approximately million was recognized as an extraordinary gain in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  nature of operations and significant accounting policies

however  this million improvement was more than offset by a  decrease in investment income  a  decrease in earned premium  and the absence in of negative goodwill which added  to income in the reduction in investment income was primarily due to lower interest income and  to a lesser extent  a reduction in invested assets as the run off continued 
in  citation recorded earned premiums of negative  due to reinsurance as discussed in preceding paragraphs  as opposed to premiums of  earned from the company s last property and casualty policies in in  citation s revenues included investment income of million  earned premiums of negative  and negative goodwill amortization of  although citation earned  in property and casualty premiums in  this was more than offset by a  reduction in earned premiums related to reinsurance

liquidity and capital resources years ended december    and cash flow pico holdings  inc is a diversified holding company 
our assets primarily consist of our operating subsidiaries  holdings in other public companies  marketable securities  and cash and cash equivalents 
on a consolidated basis  the company had million in cash and cash equivalents at december   compared to million at december  in addition to the million in consolidated cash and cash equivalents as defined by gaap  at december   the parent company held investment grade fixed income securities maturing during with a market value of million 
our cash flow position fluctuates depending on the requirements of our operating subsidiaries for capital  and activity in our insurance company investment portfolios 
our primary sources of funds include cash balances  cash flow from operations  the sale of holdings  and potentially the proceeds of borrowings or offerings of equity and debt 
we endeavor to ensure that funds are always available to take advantage of new opportunities 
in broad terms  the cash flow profile of our principal operating subsidiaries is during the company s investment and development phase  vidler water company  inc utilized cash to purchase properties with significant water rights  to construct improvements at the vidler arizona recharge facility  to maintain and develop existing assets  to pursue applications for water rights  and to meet financing and operating expenses 
during this period  we provided financing to meet vidler s on going expenses and to fund capital expenditure and the purchase of additional water righted properties 
vidler s water related assets began to generate significant cash flow in as commercial use of these assets increases  we expect that vidler will start to generate free cash flow as receipts from leasing water or storage  and the proceeds from selling land and water rights  begin to overtake maintenance capital expenditure  financing costs  and operating expenses 
as water lease and storage contracts are signed  we anticipate that vidler may be able to monetize some of the contractual revenue streams  which could potentially provide another source of funds  nevada land resource company  llc is actively selling land which has reached its highest and best use  and is not part of pico s long term utilization plan for the property 
nevada land s principal sources of cash flow are the proceeds of cash sales  and collections of principal and interest on sales contracts where nevada land has provided vendor financing 
since these receipts and other revenues exceed nevada land s operating costs  nevada land is generating strong positive cash flow  at this stage of run off  investment income more than covers citation insurance company s operating expenses 
the funds required to pay claims are coming from the maturity of fixed income investments in the company s investment portfolio  and recoveries from reinsurance companies  as its run off progresses  physicians insurance company of ohio is obtaining funds to pay operating expenses and claims from the maturity of fixed income securities  the realization of investments  and recoveries from reinsurance companies  and it is anticipated that the sale of sequoia insurance company will close on or around march  until then  we expect that sequoia will generate positive cash flow from increased written premium volume 
shortly after a policy is written  the premium is collected and the funds can be invested for a period of time before they are required to pay claims 
until the sale closes  free cash flow generated by sequoia is being retained in the company s investment portfolio 
the departments of insurance in ohio and california prescribe minimum levels of capital and surplus for insurance companies  and set guidelines for insurance company investments 
pico s insurance subsidiaries structure the maturity of fixed income securities to match the projected pattern of claims payments  however  it is possible that fixed income and equity securities may occasionally need to be sold at unfavorable times when the bond market and or the stock market are depressed 
as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flow  there was a million net increase in cash and cash equivalents in  compared to a million net increase in during  operating activities generated cash of million  compared to million used in  and million used in the most significant cash inflows from operating activities were in  approximately million in proceeds from water rights and land sold by vidler and million in cash generated by discontinued operations sequoia  and in  million in total receipts from vidler s sale of water rights and land in the harquahala valley irrigation district 
in all three years  the principal uses of cash were operating expenses at vidler  claims payments by physicians and citation  and overhead expenses 
in  investing activities used cash of million 
this primarily represented the sale of our holding in aog for million and the subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds in fixed income securities and a marketable equity security  and regular activity in the investment portfolios of our insurance companies 
in  investing activities generated cash of million 
the most significant cash inflow was million from the sale of part of our interest in semitropic 
significant cash outflows included the investment of approximately million in sihl and aog common stock 
most of the remaining investing activities cash flow represents activity in the investment portfolios of our insurance companies  and the temporary investment of surplus funds in fixed income securities 
investing activities used million of cash in most of the investing activities cash flow represents activity in the investment portfolios of our insurance companies  where the proceeds of cash and cash equivalents and maturing fixed income securities were reinvested in longer dated corporate bonds and  to a lesser extent  in small capitalization value stocks 
in addition  vidler made a million payment related to the semitropic water banking and exchange program 
in  financing activities used million of cash  primarily due to the repayment of million in non recourse borrowings collateralized by the farm properties in the harquahala valley irrigation district by vidler  and a net reduction of  in swiss franc borrowings 
despite these cash payments  the level of borrowings shown on the balance sheet was unchanged year over year  due to the effect of exchange rate movements on swiss franc borrowings 
the swiss franc borrowings form a partial currency hedge against our swiss assets 
financing activities used million of cash in vidler paid off approximately million in non recourse borrowings collateralized by the farm properties in the harquahala valley irrigation district which it sold during the year 
global equity sa took on an additional million of swiss franc denominated borrowings to help finance the acquisition of investments in swiss public companies 
in  there was a million cash inflow from financing activities  principally due to the rights offering which raised million in new equity capital 
at december   pico had no significant commitments for future capital expenditures 
share repurchase program in october  pico s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of pico common stock 
the stock purchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices through open market or negotiated transactions  depending on market conditions  and will be funded from available cash 
as of december   no stock had been repurchased under this authorization 
supplementary disclosures at december  pico had no off balance sheet financing arrangements  pico has not provided any debt guarantees  and pico has no commitments to provide additional collateral for financing arrangements 
pico s swiss subsidiary  global equity sa  has swiss franc borrowings which partially finance the company s european stock holdings 
if the market value of those stocks declines below certain levels  we could be required to provide additional collateral or to repay a portion of the swiss franc borrowings 
vidler  a pico subsidiary  is party to a lease to acquire  acre feet of underground water storage privileges and associated rights to recharge and recover water located near the california aqueduct  northwest of bakersfield 
the agreement requires a minimum payment of  per year adjusted annually by the engineering price index until pico signed a limited guarantee agreement with semitropic water storage district semitropic that requires pico to guarantee vidler s annual obligation up to  adjusted annually by the engineering price index

hart now the company s chairman and ceo call options to buy part of gpg s investment in physicians at a price equal to gpg s cost gpg call options 
since these call options were granted by gpg over shares it owned in physicians  the economic cost of the options was borne by gpg 
in  when gpg subsequently sold its investment in physicians  the company purchased the shares subject to the options from gpg at the exercise price and assumed the call option obligations 
this now equates to call options to acquire  shares of pico stock at an average exercise price of per share 
the shares purchased from gpg have been accounted for as treasury stock 
as illustrated in the following table  if these options had been exercised at december   there would have been a reduction in book value per share of approximately

the options are exercisable at prices ranging from to per share  with an average exercise price of approximately per share 
at december   all of these options were out of the money ie  exercisable at a price higher than the last sale price for pico stock  which was 
typically an option holder will only exercise an option if the stock price is greater than the exercise price

risk factors in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed in the preceding sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this document  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating pico and its business 
the statements contained in this form k that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the exchange act  including statements regarding our expectations  beliefs  intentions  plans or strategies regarding the future 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date thereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
because our operations are diverse  analysts and investors may not be able to evaluate our company adequately  which may negatively influence our share price pico is a diversified holding company with operations in land and related water rights and mineral rights  water rights and water storage  insurance operations in run off  and business acquisitions and financing 
each of these areas is unique  complex in nature  and difficult to understand 
in particular  water rights is a developing industry within the western united states with very little historical data  very few experts and a limited following of analysts 
because we are so complex  analysts and investors may not be able to adequately evaluate our operations  and pico in total 
this could cause them to make inaccurate evaluations of our stock  or to overlook pico  in general 
these factors could have a negative impact on the trading volume and price of our stock 
if we do not successfully locate  select and manage investments and acquisitions or if our investments or acquisitions otherwise fail or decline in value  our financial condition could suffer we invest in businesses that we believe are undervalued or that will benefit from additional capital  restructuring of operations or improved competitiveness through operational efficiencies 
failures and or declines in the market values of businesses we invest in or acquire  as well as our failure to successfully locate  select and manage investment and acquisition opportunities  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  the results of operations and cash flows 
such business failures  declines in market values  and or failure to successfully locate  select and manage investments and acquisitions could result in inferior investment returns compared to those which may have been attained had we successfully located  selected and managed new investments and acquisition opportunities  or had our investments or acquisitions not failed or declined in value 
we could also lose part or all of our capital these businesses and experience reductions in our net income  cash flows  assets and shareholders equity 
we will continue to make selective acquisitions  and endeavor to enhance and realize additional value to these acquired companies through our influence and control 
this could involve the restructuring of the financing or management of the entities in which we invest and initiating and facilitating mergers and acquisitions 
any acquisition could result in the use of a significant portion of our available cash  significant dilution to you  and significant acquisition related charges 
acquisitions may also result in the assumption of liabilities  including liabilities that are unknown or not fully known at the time of the acquisition  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we do not know of any reliable statistical data that would enable us to predict the probability of success or failure of our acquisitions and investments  or to predict the availability of suitable investments at the time we have available cash 
you will be relying on the experience and judgment of management to locate  select and develop new acquisition and investment opportunities 
sufficient opportunities may not be found and this business strategy may not be successful 
we have made a number of acquisitions in the past that have been highly successful and we have also made acquisitions that have lost money

our ability to achieve an acceptable rate of return on any particular investment is subject to a number of factors which are beyond our control  including increased competition and loss of market share  quality of management  cyclical or uneven financial results  technological obsolescence  foreign currency risks and regulatory delays 
our acquisitions may not achieve acceptable rates of return and we may not realize the value of the funds invested  accordingly  these investments may have to be written down or sold at their then prevailing market values 
we may not be able to sell our investments in both private and public companies when it appears to be advantageous to do so and we may have to sell these investments at a discount 
investments in private companies are not as marketable as investments in public companies 
investments in public companies are subject to prices determined in the public markets and  therefore  values can vary dramatically 
in particular  the ability of the public markets to absorb a large block of shares offered for sale can affect our ability to dispose of an investment in a public company 
we may acquire shares of stock in us public companies that are not registered with the sec  and we may not be able to register the stock during our period of ownership 
accordingly  this may affect our ability to dispose of an investment in a public company or achieve the full market price quoted by the stock exchange that the particular stock is listed on 
to successfully manage newly acquired companies  we must  among other things  continue to attract and retain key management and other personnel 
the diversion of the attention of management from the day to day operations  or difficulties encountered in the integration process  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and the results of operations and cash flows 
we may make investments and acquisitions that may yield low or negative returns for an extended period of time  which could temporarily or permanently depress our return on investments we generally make investments and acquisitions that tend to be long term in nature 
we acquire businesses that we believe to be undervalued or may benefit from additional capital  restructuring of operations or management or improved competitiveness through operational efficiencies with our existing operations 
we may not be able to develop acceptable revenue streams and investment returns 
we may lose part or all of our investment in these assets 
the negative impacts on cash flows  income  assets and shareholders equity may be temporary or permanent 
we make investments for the purpose of enhancing and realizing additional value by means of appropriate levels of shareholder influence and control 
this may involve restructuring of the financing or management of the entities in which we invest and initiating or facilitating mergers and acquisitions 
these processes can consume considerable amounts of time and resources 
consequently  costs incurred as a result of these investments and acquisitions may exceed their revenues and or increases in their values for an extended period of time until we are able to develop the potential of these investments and acquisitions and increase the revenues  profits and or values of these investments 
ultimately  however  we may not be able to develop the potential of these assets that we originally anticipated 
if we underestimate the amount of insurance claims  our financial condition could be materially misstated and our financial condition could suffer our insurance subsidiaries may not have established reserves adequate to meet the ultimate cost of losses arising from claims 
it has been  and will continue to be  necessary for our insurance subsidiaries to review and make appropriate adjustments to reserves for claims and expenses for settling claims 
inadequate reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and the results of operations and cash flows 
inadequate reserves could cause our financial condition to fluctuate from period to period and cause our financial condition to appear to be better than it actually is for periods in which insurance claims reserves are understated 
in subsequent periods when we discover the underestimation and pay the additional claims  our cash needs will be greater than expected and our financial results of operations for that period will be worse than they would have been had our reserves been accurately estimated originally 
the inherent uncertainties in estimating loss reserves are greater for some insurance products than for others  and are dependent on the length of time in reporting claims  the diversity of historical losses among claims  the amount of historical information available during the estimation process  the degree of impact that changing regulations and legal precedents may have on open claims  and the consistency of reinsurance programs over time 
because medical malpractice liability and commercial casualty claims may not be completely paid off for several years  estimating reserves for these types of claims can be more uncertain than estimating reserves for other types of insurance 
as a result  precise reserve estimates cannot be made for several years following the year for which reserves were initially established 
during the past several years  the levels of the reserves for our insurance subsidiaries have been very volatile 
we have had to significantly increase and decrease these reserves in the past several years 
significant increases in the reserves may be necessary in the future  and the level of reserves for our insurance subsidiaries may be volatile in the future 
these increases or volatility may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and the results of operations and cash flows 
state regulators could require changes to our capitalization and or to the operations of our insurance subsidiaries  and or place them into rehabilitation or liquidation beginning in  physicians and citation became subject to the provisions of the risk based capital for insurers model act which has been adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners for the purpose of helping regulators identify insurers that may be in financial difficulty 
the model act contains a formula which takes into account asset risk  credit risk  underwriting risk and all other relevant risks 
under this formula  each insurer is required to report to regulators using formulas which measure the quality of its capital and the relationship of its modified capital base to the level of risk assumed in specific aspects of its operations 
the formula does not address all of the risks associated with the operations of an insurer 
the formula is intended to provide a minimum threshold measure of capital adequacy by individual insurance company and does not purport to compute a target level of capital 
companies which fall below the threshold will be placed into one of four categories company action level  where the insurer must submit a plan of corrective action  regulatory action level  where the insurer must submit such a plan of corrective action  the regulator is required to perform such examination or analysis the superintendent of insurance considers necessary and the regulator must issue a corrective order  authorized control level  which includes the above actions and may include rehabilitation or liquidation  and mandatory control level  where the regulator must rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer 
all companies risk based capital results as of december  exceed the company action level 
if we are required to register as an investment company  then we will be subject to a significant regulatory burden at all times we intend to conduct our business so as to avoid being regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of however  if we were required to register as an investment company  our ability to use debt would be substantially reduced  and we would be subject to significant additional disclosure obligations and restrictions on our operational activities 
because of the additional requirements imposed on an investment company with regard to the distribution of earnings  operational activities and the use of debt  in addition to increased expenditures due to additional reporting responsibilities  our cash available for investments would be reduced 
the additional expenses would reduce income 
these factors would adversely affect our business  financial condition  and the results of operations and cash flows 
variances in physical availability of water  along with environmental and legal restrictions and legal impediments could impact profitability from our water rights the water rights held by us and the transferability of these rights to other uses and places of use are governed by the laws concerning water rights in the states of arizona  colorado and nevada 
the volumes of water actually derived from the water rights applications or permitted rights may vary considerably based upon physical availability and may be further limited by applicable legal restrictions 
as a result  the amounts of acre feet anticipated from the water rights applications or permitted rights do not in every case represent a reliable  firm annual yield of water  but in some cases describe the face amount of the water right claims or management s best estimate of such entitlement 
legal impediments may exist to the sale or transfer of some of these water rights  which in turn may affect their commercial value 
if we were unable to transfer or sell our water rights  we will not be able to make a profit  we will not have enough cash receipts to cover cash needs  and we may lose some or all of our value in our water rights acquisitions 
water we lease or sell may be subject to regulation as to quality by the united states environmental protection agency acting pursuant to the federal safe drinking water act 
while environmental regulations do not directly affect us  the regulations regarding the quality of water distributed affects our intended customers and may  therefore  depending on the quality of our water  impact the price and terms upon which we may in the future sell our or water rights 
our future water revenues are uncertain and depend on a number of factors  which may make our revenue streams and profitability volatile we engage in various water rights acquisition  management  development  and sale and lease activities 
accordingly  our long term future profitability will be primarily dependent on our ability to develop and sell or lease water and water rights  and will be affected by various factors  including timing of acquisitions  transportation arrangements  and changing technology 
to the extent we possess junior or conditional water rights  such rights may be subordinated to superior water right holders in periods of low flow or drought 
in addition to the risk of delays associated with receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and permits  we may also encounter unforeseen technical difficulties which could result in construction delays and cost increases with respect to our water and water storage development projects 
our profitability is significantly affected by changes in the market price of water 
in the future  water prices may fluctuate widely as demand is affected by climatic  demographic and technological factors 
our water activities may become concentrated in a limited number of assets  making our growth and profitability vulnerable to fluctuations in local economies and governmental regulations in the future  we anticipate that a significant amount of vidler s revenues and asset value will come from a limited number of assets  including our water rights in the harquahala valley and the vidler arizona recharge facility 
although we continue to acquire and develop additional water assets  in the foreseeable future we anticipate that our revenues will still be derived from a limited number of assets 
our water sales may meet with political opposition in certain locations  thereby limiting our growth in these areas the transfer of water rights from one use to another may affect the economic base of a community and will  in some instances  be met with local opposition 
moreover  certain of the end users of our water rights  namely municipalities  regulate the use of water in order to control or deter growth 
we are directly impacted by international affairs  which directly exposes us to the adverse effects of any foreign economic or governmental instability as a result of global investment diversification  our business  financial condition  the results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates  the imposition of governmental controls  the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and us export laws  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  volatile interest rates  changes in certain commodity prices  exchange controls which may limit our ability to withdraw money  the greater difficulty of administering business overseas  and general economic conditions outside the united states 
changes in any or all of these factors could result in reduced market values of investments  loss of assets  additional expenses  reduced investment income  reductions in shareholders equity due to foreign currency fluctuations and a reduction in our global diversification 
our common stock price may be low when you want to sell your shares the trading price of our common stock has historically been  and is expected to be  subject to fluctuations 
the market price of the common stock may be significantly impacted by quarterly variations in financial performance and condition  shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels forecast by securities analysts  changes in estimates by such analysts  product introductions  our competitors announcements of extraordinary events such as acquisitions  litigation  and general economic conditions 
our results of operations have been subject to significant fluctuations  particularly on a quarterly basis  and our future results of operations could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
causes of such fluctuations may include the inclusion or exclusion of operating earnings from newly acquired or sold operations 
at december   the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market was per share  compared to at december  on a quarterly basis between these two dates  closing prices have ranged from a high of at june  to a low of at september  during  closing prices have ranged from a low of per share on october to a high of on april statements or changes in opinions  ratings  or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the markets in which we do business or relating to us specifically could result in an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we may not be able to retain key management personnel we need to succeed  which could adversely affect our ability to make sound investment decisions we have several key executive officers 
if they depart  it could have a significant adverse effect

management s use of judgment in preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation our financial statements in conformity with u 
s gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses may differ by using different assumptions 
in addition  in future periods  in order to incorporate all known experience at that time  we may have to revise assumptions previously made which may change the value of previously reported assets and liabilities 
this potential subsequent change in value may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and the results of operations and cash flows 
see critical accounting policies in item common stock transactions our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
the stock purchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices though open market  or negotiated transactions  depending on market conditions  and will be funded from available cash resources of the company 
such a repurchase program may have an impact on our cash flows

future changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards could have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting transactions completed before the change is effective 
any changes requiring that we record compensation expense in the statement of operations for employee stock options using the fair value method could have a significant negative effect on our reported results 
new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results of the way we conduct our business 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
absence of dividends could reduce our attractiveness to investors 
some investors favor companies that pay dividends  particularly in market downturns 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and  therefore  we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock 
we may need additional capital in the future to fund the growth of our business  and financing may not be available 
we currently anticipate that our available capital resources and operating income will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  we cannot assure you that such resources will be sufficient to fund the long term growth of our business 
we may raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings if such financings become available on favorable terms  but such financing may dilute our stockholders 
we cannot assure you that you that any additional financing we need will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
in any such case  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
litigation may harm our business or otherwise distract our management 
substantial  complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur large expenditures and distract our management 
for example  lawsuits by employees  stockholders or customers could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business 
disputes from time to time with such companies or individuals are not uncommon  and we cannot assure that that we will always be able to resolve such disputes out of court or on terms favorable to us 
the foregoing factors  individually or in aggregate  could materially adversely affect our operating results and could make comparison of historic operating results and balances difficult or not meaningful 
regulatory insurance disclosures liabilities for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses liabilities for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are estimated based upon actual and industry experience  and assumptions and projections as to claims frequency  severity and inflationary trends and settlement payments 
such estimates may vary from the eventual outcome 
the inherent uncertainty in estimating reserves is particularly acute for lines of business for which both reported and paid losses develop over an extended period of time 
several years or more may elapse between the occurrence of an insured medical professional liability insurance or casualty loss  the reporting of the loss and the final payment of the loss 
loss reserves are estimates of what an insurer expects to pay claimants  legal and investigative costs and claims administrative costs 
pico s insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain reserves for payment of estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses for both reported claims and claims which have occurred but have not yet been reported 
ultimate actual liabilities may be materially more or less than current reserve estimates 
reserves for reported claims are established on a case by case basis 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  the regulatory environment  benefit levels  economic conditions  judicial administration of claims  general trends in claim severity and frequency  medical costs and other factors which could affect the adequacy of loss reserves 
management reviews and adjusts incurred but not reported claims reserves regularly 
the liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of physicians and citation were million at december   million at december   and million at december  before reinsurance reserves  which reduce net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
of those amounts  the liabilities for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses of prior years decreased by million in  and million in  and increased by million in the increase included million of accumulated discount on reserves that was expensed as a result of our decision to discontinue discounting reserves effective january  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
these changes to prior years reserves were due to the following change in unpaid loss and lae reserves for prior years increase decrease in provision for prior year claims    retroactive reinsurance    cumulative effect of an accounting change  net increase decrease in liabilities for unpaid loss and lae of prior years    see schedule in note of notes to pico s consolidated financial statements  reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for additional information regarding reserve changes 
although insurance reserves are certified annually by independent actuaries for each insurance company as required by state law  significant fluctuations in reserve levels can occur based upon a number of variables used in actuarial projections of ultimate incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 
all of pico s insurance companies seek to reduce the loss that may arise from individually significant claims or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk with other insurance carriers 
various reinsurance treaties remain in place to limit pico s exposure levels 
analysis of loss and loss adjustment expense development the following table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for through for all continuing operations property and casualty lines of business and medical professional liability insurance 
the net liability as originally estimated line shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recorded at the balance sheet date on a discounted basis  prior to  for each of the indicated years 
reserves for other lines of business that physicians ceased writing in  which are immaterial  are excluded 
the gross liability as originally estimated represents the estimated amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis  including losses that had been incurred but not reported 
year ended december  in thousands net liability as originally estimated       discount       gross liability as originally estimated       cumulative payments as of one year later       two years later       three years later       four years later       five years later       six years later      seven years later     eight years later    nine years later   ten years later  liability re estimated as of one year later       two years later       three years later       four years later       five years later       six years later      seven years later     eight years later    nine years later   ten years later  cumulative redundancy deficiency       year ended december  in thousands net liability as originally estimated      discount   gross liability before discount as originally estimated      cumulative payments as of one year later     two years later    three years later   four years later  five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later liability re estimated as of one year later     two years later    three years later   four years later  five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later cumulative redundancy deficiency     reconciliation to financial statements gross liability end of year    reinsurance recoverable    net liability end of year    reinsurance recoverable    discontinued personal lines insurance balance sheet liability    gross re estimated liability latest   re estimated recoverable latest   net re estimated liability before discount latest   net re estimated liability latest   net cumulative redundancy before discount   each decrease or increase amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods 
for example  the amount of the redundancy related to losses settled in  but incurred in  will be included in the decrease or increase amount for  and conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
for example  physicians commuted reinsurance contracts in several different years that significantly increased the estimate of net reserves for prior years by reducing the recoverable loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for those years 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future increases or decreases based on this table 
the data in the above table is based on schedule p from each of physician s and citation s to annual statements  as filed with state insurance departments  however  the development table above differs from the development displayed in schedule p  part  of the insurance annual statements as schedule p  part  excludes unallocated loss adjustment expenses 
loss reserve experience the inherent uncertainties in estimating loss reserves are greater for some insurance products than for others  and are dependent on the length of the reporting lag or tail associated with a given product ie  the lapse of time between the occurrence of a claim and the report of the claim to the insurer  on the diversity of historical development patterns among various aggregations of claims  the amount of historical information available during the estimation process  the degree of impact that changing regulations and legal precedents may have on open claims  and the consistency of reinsurance programs over time  among other things 
because medical professional liability insurance and commercial casualty claims may not be fully paid for several years or more  estimating reserves for such claims can be more uncertain than estimating reserves in other lines of insurance 
as a result  precise reserve estimates cannot be made for several years following a current accident year for which reserves are initially established 
there can be no assurance that the insurance companies have established reserves adequate to meet the ultimate cost of losses arising from such claims 
it has been necessary  and will over time continue to be necessary  for the insurance companies to review and make appropriate adjustments to reserves for estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses 
to the extent reserves prove to be inadequate  the insurance companies would have to adjust their reserves and incur a charge to income  which could have a material adverse effect on pico s financial results

reinsurance medical professional liability insurance through physicians insurance company of ohio on july   physicians entered into an agreement for the purchase and sale of certain assets with mutual assurance  inc this transaction closed on august  pursuant to the agreement  physicians sold their professional liability insurance business and related liability insurance business for physicians and other health care providers 
simultaneously with execution of the agreement  physicians and mutual entered into a reinsurance treaty pursuant to which mutual agreed to assume all risks attaching after july  under medical professional liability insurance policies issued or renewed by physicians on physicians  surgeons  nurses  and other health care providers  dental practitioner professional liability insurance policies including corporate and professional premises liability coverage issued by physicians  and related commercial general liability insurance policies issued by physicians  net of applicable reinsurance

physicians ceded insurance to these carriers on an automatic basis when retention limits were exceeded 
physicians retained all risks up to  per occurrence 
all risks above  up to policy limits of million  were transferred to reinsurers  subject to the specific terms and conditions of the various reinsurance treaties 
physicians remains primarily liable to policyholders for ceded insurance should any reinsurer be unable to meet its contractual obligations 
property and casualty insurance through citation insurance company and sequoia insurance company effective january   sequoia and citation entered into an inter company reinsurance pooling agreement for business in force as of january  and business written thereafter 
per the agreement  citation ceded of its net premium and losses to sequoia and sequoia then ceded of its net premiums and losses to citation 
sequoia and citation shared equally in the underwriting expenses 
this arrangement was terminated effective january  during this period  citation and sequoia had the same reinsurance program 
for property business  reinsurance provided coverage of million excess of  per occurrence 
for casualty business  excluding umbrella coverage  reinsurance provided coverage of million excess of  per occurrence 
umbrella coverages were reinsured million excess of  per occurrence 
the catastrophe treaties for and thereafter provided coverage of of million excess of million per occurrence 
facultative reinsurance was placed with various reinsurers 
effective january   sequoia increased its retention for property and casualty losses from  to  per occurrence 
therefore  reinsurance provides property coverage of million excess of  per occurrence  and casualty coverage of million excess of  per occurrence 
in addition  sequoia changed the umbrella reinsurance from million excess of  per occurrence to quota share reinsurance for the first million 
therefore  sequoia will retain of each umbrella loss while the reinsurance provides for of each umbrella loss 
the reinsurance for umbrella business million excess of million per occurrence remains at 
the catastrophe treaties for provide coverage of for million excess of million per occurrence  and for million per occurrence excess of million 
citation does not require reinsurance from onwards  as its last policy expired in december where the reinsurers are not admitted for regulatory purposes  sequoia and citation presently maintain sufficient collateral with approved financial institutions to secure cessions of paid losses and outstanding reserves 
all policy and claims liabilities of sequoia prior to august  have been reinsured with sydney reinsurance corporation and unconditionally guaranteed by qbe insurance group limited 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  reinsurance  with regard to reinsurance recoverable concentration for all property and casualty lines of business as of december  pico remains contingently liable with respect to reinsurance contracts in the event that reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements in force 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pico s balance sheets include a significant amount of assets and liabilities whose fair value are subject to market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market interest rates or prices 
pico currently has interest rate risk as it relates to its fixed maturity securities and mortgage participation interests  equity price risk as it relates to its marketable equity securities  and foreign currency risk as it relates to investments denominated in foreign currencies 
generally  pico s borrowings are short to medium term in nature and therefore approximate fair value 
at december   pico including the investments held by discontinued operations had million of fixed maturity securities and mortgage participation interests  million of marketable equity securities that were subject to market risk  of which million were denominated in foreign currencies  primarily swiss francs 
pico s investment strategy is to manage the duration of the portfolio relative to the duration of the liabilities while managing interest rate risk 
pico uses two models to analyze the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities subject to the above risks 
for its fixed maturity securities  and mortgage participation interests  pico uses duration modeling to calculate changes in fair value 
for its marketable securities  pico uses a hypothetical decrease in the fair value to analyze the sensitivity of its market risk assets and liabilities 
for investments denominated in foreign currencies  pico uses a hypothetical decrease in the local currency of that investment 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical results assumed in this disclosure due to possible actions taken by management to mitigate adverse changes in fair value and because the fair value of securities may be affected by credit concerns of the issuer  prepayment rates  liquidity  and other general market conditions 
the sensitivity analysis duration model produced a loss in fair value of million for a basis point decline in interest rates on its fixed securities and mortgage participation interests 
the hypothetical decrease in fair value of pico s marketable equity securities produced a loss in fair value of million that would impact the unrealized appreciation in shareholders equity 
the hypothetical decrease in the local currency of pico s foreign denominated investments produced a loss of million that would impact the foreign currency translation in shareholders equity
