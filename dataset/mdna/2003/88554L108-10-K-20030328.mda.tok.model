overview we offer advanced design and manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers  commonly referred to as oems 
we have two business divisions  each reportable as a segment 
the first segment is referred to as the integrated systems and displays division 
in that division  we focus on display products and our electronic manufacturing services 
we specialize in custom and standard display modules utilizing various display technologies  including liquid crystal displays  or lcds  organic light emitting displays  or oleds  and cathode ray tubes  or crts 
our display modules are of varying sizes and have varying levels of integration 
at a minimum  each display module includes a display  a custom driver  and a flexible connector 
we also provide ruggedized and customized monitors 
we also provide value added services  which increase our competitiveness  by assembling additional components onto the module based upon the specific needs of the customer 
these additional components may include such items as keypads  microphones  speakers  light guides  and optics 
late in  we expanded the value added manufacturing services we provide in the isd division through our acquisition of etma corporation  described below 
as a result of that acquisition  we now provide printed circuit board assembly  or pcba  and box build capabilities to customers  even in products that do not need displays 
in our second business segment  referred to as the microdisplay division  we offer a range of lcos product solutions with different levels of integration from individual imagers to optical light engines 
the initial target markets for our lcos microdisplay products are large screen television sets  front projectors  and near to eye or personal display system applications 
substantially all of our sales are in our isd division 
in the past several years  we derived our revenue principally from major oems  with more than of our net sales in   and from the mobile handset market 
as a result of the acquisition of etma and the expected reduction in motorola business  we expect our revenue from the handset market to drop to below in when we win a custom program  our customers occasionally pay a portion of our nonrecurring engineering expenses to defray the costs of custom design  as well as all or a portion of the costs of nonrecurring tooling for custom or specialized components 
the typical design program life cycle of a custom designed display module is three to fifteen months and includes technical design  prototyping  pilot manufacturing  and high volume manufacturing 
the cycle is shorter in the manufacturing services business where no display is involved and where the design has already been done by the oem customer 
until  our strategy in our display business was to seek large volume programs from major oems 
in that situation  the minimum production quantity for a display module typically approximates  units per year  although the production rate for some programs has been higher than  units per week 
in  we re focused our strategy on lower volume programs with potentially higher gross margins 
we re focused our strategy because some oems with high volume programs began to expect to purchase display modules for less than industry costs 
early in  we licensed the standard product line of data international 
the standard products of data international that we sell will fit into the strategy of lower volume programs 
the selling price of our products sold in the isd division now range from between and  per unit 
we experienced substantial growth from through  primarily as a result of sales to oems in the wireless communications industry  which grew substantially during that period 
during that period  our primary customer in the wireless communications industry was motorola 
we experienced substantial growth in and  but our sales substantially declined in as a result of the world wide economic slowdown 
motorola and its subcontractors accounted for of our sales in  in  in  in  and in as a result of our change in strategy regarding high volume display programs  discussed above  none of our design wins in and have been with the handset group at motorola 
consequently  we expect total motorola business to decline sharply in in the third quarter of  motorola was of our business 
in the fourth quarter of  motorola was of our business 
in the first quarter of  we expect motorola to be less than of our business 
for all of  we expect motorola to account for less than of our revenue 

table of contents during the past several years  we have experienced seasonal quarterly fluctuations in our net sales as our oem customers developed retail products with shorter product life cycles and phased out older programs early in the year following holiday sales 
therefore  as compared with the fourth quarter of a calendar year  sales are usually lower in the following quarter 
although that pattern of first quarter softness is expected in  our revenue is not actually expected to decline because of the etma acquisition that occurred in december in all of our businesses  we recognize revenue related to product shipments when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product or service has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
these conditions are met at the time we either ship products to customers or when they are received by the customer  depending on when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
we recognize revenue related to nonrecurring engineering and nonrecurring tooling after service has been rendered 
this can be determined based upon completion of agreed upon milestones or deliverables 
several factors impact our gross margins  including manufacturing efficiencies  product mix  product differentiation  product uniqueness  inventory management  and volume pricing 
in the past  we used our own front end lcd production line in tempe  arizona for the manufacture of more technologically complex and custom high volume lcds 
we also purchased lcds from third parties to provide us an alternate source and to ensure available capacity 
in order to take advantage of lower labor costs  we traditionally shipped lcds to our facilities in manila  the philippines  or beijing  china  for assembly into modules 
during  we decided to shut down and move our front end manufacturing lcd line from arizona to asia 
we now purchase all of our lcds from third parties  although we sometimes purchase partially completed lcds and complete the back end operations on those lcds in manila  as described below 
during  we signed a cooperative agreement with a chinese company under which we agreed to sell the equipment used in our front end lcd line and establish a supply agreement 
under the terms of the cooperative agreement  in exchange for our front end lcd line  we will receive million in cash  favorable lcd glass pricing  and flexible yet assured manufacturing capacity from this strategic partner 
in the second quarter of  as a result of signing the cooperative agreement  we realized a charge of million for the write down on the lcd equipment to be sold to the chinese company 
this charge was reported as a separate line item in operating expense 
in connection with the cooperative agreement  we received million in  all of which was applied against the million sales price and recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the lcd equipment held for sale 
the sale of the equipment is expected to be completed in in tempe  arizona  we continue to manufacture all of our lcos microdisplays on our high volume liquid crystal on silicon manufacturing line 
in addition  we do all testing and assembly into lcos modules in tempe 
in redmond  washington  we provide engineering support  automated printed circuit board assembly  in circuit and functional testing  systems integration and box build  complete supply chain management  and turnkey packaging and fulfillment services 
in marlboro  massachusetts  we provide aftermarket customization of crt and lcd monitors 
in manila  we assemble displays into modules and perform certain back end lcd processing operations 
we conduct all of our operations in manila at our own factory where we employ our own employees 
until april  our back end lcd processing operations were conducted in manila through a third party subcontract manufacturer 
since that date  however  the manila back end lcd processing has been performed in our own facility 
the new facility is located in a special philippines economic zone peza  which allows us to take advantage of certain tax benefits 
in beijing  we also assemble displays into modules 
we conduct our display module operations in beijing through our wholly owned foreign subsidiary at a facility we own 
we also employ all of our own employees in beijing 
selling  general  and administrative expense consists principally of administrative and selling costs  salaries  commissions  and benefits to personnel  and related facility costs 
we make substantially all of our sales 
table of contents directly to oems through a sales force that consists of both direct technical sales persons and a representative network 
as a result  there is no material cost of distribution in our selling  general  and administrative expense 
in addition  we have recently incurred substantial marketing and administrative expenses in connection with our lcos microdisplay business 
research  development  and engineering expense consists principally of salaries and benefits to scientists  design engineers  and other technical personnel  related facility costs  process development costs  and various expenses for projects  including new product development 
research  development  and engineering expense continues to increase as we develop new display products and technologies  especially lcos microdisplays 
since  we have been working on the development of lcos microdisplays 
in  we entered into a strategic alliance with national semiconductor corporation for the development of lcos microdisplay products 
under that alliance  national semiconductor focused on the silicon technologies needed for microdisplays  and we focused on the liquid crystal technologies 
in  national semiconductor decided to close its microdisplay business unit 
in connection with that closing  in july  we purchased certain assets and licensed silicon technologies from national semiconductor relating to lcos microdisplays 
we paid approximately million in cash and issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock in the transaction  which valued the transaction at approximately million 
no additional payments are required under the licenses 
we also hired several key technical employees of national semiconductor to assist in the implementation of the acquired technologies 
in april  we entered into a strategic relationship with inviso  inc  a privately held company with numerous patents and proprietary technology related to microdisplay development 
we acquired a minority equity interest in inviso for approximately million 
in march  we acquired an additional interest in inviso for  raising our total minority equity interest to million 
as part of this strategic relationship  we provided proprietary manufacturing capabilities and liquid crystal expertise  and inviso provided patented and proprietary technologies and components for the joint development of microdisplay products 
in the second quarter of  we wrote off our investment of million in inviso because we determined that our investment was impaired  as that term is defined under generally accepted accounting principles 
subsequent to our write off  inviso was unable to raise funds to operate its business and has since ceased operations 
in the second quarter of  we purchased all of the intellectual property of inviso for  in august  our wholly owned subsidiary  three five systems beijing co  ltd  entered into a strategic agreement with heibei jiya electronics  co  ltd 
jiya  a chinese based manufacturer of lcd glass 
under the terms of the agreement  jiya agreed to provide lcd glass to us and reserve a significant amount of lcd glass manufacturing capacity for us 
in exchange  we agreed to assist jiya in further developing its lcd glass manufacturing processes 
at the end of the agreement term in february  we had the option to extend the agreement or to acquire a majority interest in jiya 
we elected not to extend the agreement or acquire a majority interest 
in  we invested million in silicon bandwidth  inc  a privately held company providing unique semiconductor and optoelectronic interconnect solutions based upon multiple  patented  proprietary technologies 
we are working closely with silicon bandwidth to design unique  cost effective  reconfigurable packaging platforms for lcos microdisplays 
during the second quarter of  we formed a new company  three d oled llc  with dupont displays  a business unit of dupont corporation 
we owned of this new venture  and dupont displays owned 
the companies pledged million to the venture 
our share of that obligation was slightly over million 
this venture was formed to design  assemble  and market oled organic light emitting diode display modules to oems worldwide with the focus on glass substrate  passive matrix oled displays 
in the second quarter of  we agreed with dupont displays to liquidate our joint venture with three d oled llc and enter into a non equity based strategic manufacturing and supply agreement 
under that agreement  the parties can continue to work together in a fashion similar to the venture  but the relationship will be nonexclusive 
we have not worked with dupont since the liquidation 

table of contents in january  we purchased the intellectual property of zight corporation  a private company focused on microdisplays for personal display system applications 
in addition  we purchased certain key assets of zight at a creditor s auction  and we hired seven key technical persons formerly employed by zight 
the total purchase price was approximately million  of which approximately million was related to intangibles 
in july  we invested million in colorlink  inc colorlink has a leading position worldwide in the development and manufacture of color management technologies for lcos microdisplays 
colorlink s products consist of color management components and system architectures that are critical for digital projection systems that use high resolution microdisplays 
those projection systems include color monitors  high definition televisions and multi media projectors 
this investment furthers our efforts to accelerate as much as possible the establishment of the necessary infrastructure for lcos microdisplays 
an additional  was recorded as investment in colorlink during the third quarter of for legal and due diligence expenses 
in september  we purchased the assets and ongoing business of avt  a privately held company that specializes in the design and integration of complex  high resolution display systems 
avt designs and provides customized and ruggedized flat panel  touchscreen  and rackmount systems for original equipment manufacturers including general electric  westinghouse  gillette and the us military 
avt sources its display components from a variety of companies including sony  sharp  nec  lg  and samsung 
the purchase price of the acquisition was million  which we paid entirely in cash 
the purchase agreement also calls for a residual purchase payment of million should the avt division achieve certain revenue and profit objectives for and in december  we purchased the stock of etma corporation  a privately held company that is an electronic manufacturer for oem customers in the automotive  computer server  medical monitoring  and internet security industries 
etma offers the manufacturing capabilities of six surface mount manufacturing lines  including one dedicated to new product introduction and prototyping activity 
etma provides engineering support  automated printed circuit board assembly  in circuit and functional testing  systems integration and box build  complete supply chain management  and turnkey packaging and fulfillment services 
the purchase price of the acquisition was million  which we paid entirely in cash 
in january  we signed licensing and manufacturing agreements with data international co  ltd 
of taiwan 
under those agreements  we become the exclusive channel in the americas for standard and custom lcd products manufactured by data international 
we also have the right to sell those products through its worldwide channels 
the agreements provide us with access to a full suite of standard display products that will round out our existing standard product portfolio 
in conjunction with the agreement  we have established a sales office in orlando and hired sales and applications engineering personnel who have supported data international s products throughout north and south america for the past ten years 
the cost of the license is anticipated to be million  of which million was paid upon signing and the million will be due over the next two years 
the unpaid million is subject to reduction if certain revenue and margin targets are not met 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
during preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales returns  pricing concessions  bad debts  inventories  investments  fixed assets  intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents we recognize sales when persuasive evidence of a sale exists  that is  a product is shipped under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
sales allowances are estimated based upon historical experience of sales returns or pricing concessions 
we recognize revenue related to engineering and tooling services after service has been rendered  which is determined based upon completion of agreed upon milestones or deliverables 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer s financial condition  credit history  and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
we write down our inventory to estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  income taxes are recorded based on current year amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we base our estimate of current and deferred taxes on the tax laws and rates that are currently in effect in the appropriate jurisdiction 
changes in tax laws or rates may affect the current amounts payable or refundable as well as the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities 
we currently have million of net deferred tax assets resulting primarily from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
sfas no 
requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we take into account all evidence with regard to the utilization of a deferred tax asset including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
we believe that the net deferred tax assets of million will be realized based primarily on our projected future earnings and scheduling of our deferred tax liabilities 
however  the amount of the deferred tax assets actually realized could differ if we have little or no future earnings 
at december   we have a valuation allowance of million for deferred tax assets related to a capital loss carryforward and certain foreign tax credit 
a deferred us tax liability has not been provided on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because it is our intent to permanently reinvest such earnings 
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  which have been  or are intended to be  permanently invested in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas  aggregated approximately million at december  long term assets  such as long term investments  property  plant and equipment  intangibles  goodwill and other investments  are originally recorded at cost 
on an on going basis  we assess these assets to determine if their current recorded value is impaired 
when assessing these assets  we examine future cash flows to determine if impairment is applicable 
these cash flows are evaluated for objectivity by using weighted probability techniques and also comparisons of past performance against projections 
assets may also be evaluated by identifying independent market values 
if we were to believe that an asset s value was impaired  we would write down the carrying value of the identified asset and charge the impairment as an expense in the period in which the determination was made 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in our consolidated financial statements 
years ended december  net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general  and administrative research  development and engineering write down of assets held for sale amortization of customer lists operating income loss other income  net minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased to million in from million in the reduction was primarily because of our reduced volume of business with our major customer motorola 
we shipped million units to motorola in compared to million units in in addition  the average selling price of those motorola units shipped in was substantially lower than in because of pricing pressures in the high volume  monochrome lcd market 
shipments were lower to motorola because of our strategic decision not to seek business from customers that would produce very low or negative gross margins 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased to of net sales in from in this percentage decrease resulted primarily from cost reduction efforts undertaken throughout the cost of sales in the isd division continued to be higher than our long range expectations because our fixed costs were under absorbed at our overseas factories as a result of excess capacity 
also contributing to the high cost of sales was the sale of lcos microdisplay products at a gross margin loss 
we incurred a loss for our lcos microdisplay sales primarily because of the low volume of shipments and low manufacturing yields in those start up products 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
selling  general  and administrative expense increased to million in from million in in  sg a consisted primarily of fixed costs because we had no distribution costs and just a small sales force that focused on custom products 
thus  sg a increased in  primarily as a result of our acquisitions of avt and etma 
research  development  and engineering expense 
research  development  and engineering expense increased slightly to million in from million in more than of our research  development  and engineering expense related to our microdisplay division as we continued intensive efforts on continued development of lcos microdisplays 
write down of assets held for sale 
during the second quarter of  we signed a cooperative agreement with a chinese company under which we agreed to sell the equipment of our front end manufacturing lcd line and establish a supply agreement 
under the terms of the cooperative agreement  and in exchange for our lcd equipment  we will receive million in cash  favorable lcd glass pricing  and flexible yet assured manufacturing capacity from this strategic partner 
thus far  we have received million 
as a result of signing the cooperative agreement  we realized a charge of million for the write down on the lcd equipment to be sold to the chinese company 
this charge was reported as a separate line item in operating expense 

table of contents amortization of customer lists 
as a result of the acquisitions of avt and etma  we have added a new line item for operating costs related to the amortization of intangible assets of customer lists that have definable lives 
we had no such expense in and  for most of that expense related to the acquisition of avt 
the initial total amount of amortizable assets associated with avt was million 
we also acquired etma corporation in the fourth quarter of  and the initial total amount of amortizable assets associated with etma was million 
the avt related assets will be amortized over five years while the etma assets will be amortized over three years 
other income expense  net 
other income in was million  slightly higher than other income of million in net interest income in was million compared to million in we incurred a million write off of our investment in inviso  inc in that offset the much higher interest income so that other income was almost identical for and benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million in compared to a benefit for income taxes of million in in recording the benefit  we used an effective tax rate of in compared to an effective tax rate of in the difference was primarily a change in relative operational results between us and foreign jurisdictions 
in other words  a greater portion of our net loss in related to higher tax rate jurisdictions  thereby causing the accrued tax benefit to be a greater percentage of our net loss 
the benefit for income taxes that we have recorded has generated a million cumulative deferred tax asset at december   primarily related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have taken some valuation allowances with respect to certain capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards  but have taken no valuation allowances with respect to other deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets on the books will be fully realized 
net loss 
in  we recorded a net loss of million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the isd segment recorded a net loss of million  or per share  in compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in the increased loss was the result of allocating  or million  of the net other income to the microdisplay segment compared to allocated in offsetting this loss of income was a cost reduction effort that improved our gross margins 
the loss on the sale of our lcd line offset some  but not all  of these cost reductions 
the microdisplay segment recorded a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the decreased loss was the result of allocating  or million  of the net other income to the microdisplay segment compared to allocated in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased to million in from million in although some of the decrease was attributable to the reduced volume of unit shipments  the revenue decrease was primarily the result of decreased selling prices of lcd modules due to excess worldwide lcd capacity 
we shipped million units in versus million units in cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to of net sales in from in this percentage increase resulted primarily from reduced selling prices and reduced operating efficiencies 
also contributing to the increased cost of sales was the sale of lcos microdisplay products at a loss 
we incurred a loss at the gross margin line for our lcos microdisplay sales primarily because of very low manufacturing yields 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
selling  general  and administrative expense increased to million in from million in selling  general  and administrative expense was of net sales in compared to of net sales in this percentage increase was due to lower net sales in research  development  and engineering expense 
research  development  and engineering expense increased to million in from million in research  development  and engineering expense were of net sales in compared to of net sales in research  development  and engineering expense overall increased as the result of the continued development of lcos microdisplays 

table of contents the selling  general  and administrative expense and the research  development  and engineering expense in each year included significant operating expenditures in lcos microdisplays at a time when there was very little lcos microdisplay revenue 
in  we incurred approximately million of operating expenses specifically related to lcos microdisplays compared to approximately million in other income expense  net 
other income in was million compared to other income of million in the primary difference was the write off of our million investment in inviso  inc net interest earned in was million compared to million in provision for benefit from income taxes 
we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million in compared to a provision for income taxes of million in in recording the benefit  we used an effective tax rate of in compared to an effective tax rate of in the difference was primarily a change in relative operational results between us and foreign jurisdictions and a higher percentage of research and development credits recorded during net income loss 
in  we recorded a net loss of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in we recorded several unusual expense items in the second quarter of  including the million write off of our investment in inviso  inc  the million write off of certain inventory  and the million write off of an enterprise resource planning system implementation 
on an after tax basis  those unusual expenses totaled million  or per diluted share 
the isd segment recorded a net loss of million  or loss per diluted share  in compared to net income of million  or earnings per share in the decline in revenue was related to intense pricing pressures for our modules and the worldwide economic slowdown in the microdisplay segment recorded a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the increased loss was as a result of intensified rd e efforts to bring microdisplays to market 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short and long term liquid investments of million compared to million at december  in  we had million in net cash outflow from operations compared to million in net cash outflow from operations in excluding inventory and dso days sales outstanding data related to our etma acquisition  our inventory turns were and dsos were days for the year as compared with inventory turns and dsos for the year our depreciation and amortization expense was million in and million in our working capital was million at december   down from million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily because of reduced cash balances as a result of operating cash outflows and acquisitions 
our current ratio at december  was to compared to to at december  in may  we renegotiated our credit facility with comerica bank 
that credit facility is a million unsecured revolving line of credit that matures in july no borrowings were outstanding under that credit facility on december  advances under the facility may be made as prime rate advances  which accrue interest payable monthly at the bank s prime lending rate  or as libor rate advances  which bear interest at basis points in excess of the libor base rate 
in may  our beijing subsidiary renewed its credit facility with the bank of china 
as of december   our beijing subsidiary had an outstanding million term loan due april  to the bank of china  which was secured by a million standby letter of credit issued by comerica bank 
acquisitions  investments  and purchases of intangibles  property  plant  and equipment during were approximately million  including million in capital expenditures  mainly associated with microdisplays  million in intangibles associated with microdisplays  million invested in colorlink  and million in acquisitions with etma and avt 
during  we purchased  shares of common stock for a total purchase price of million  including  shares in the fourth quarter for  
table of contents the following tables list our contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total amounts less in thousands committed than year years years years and over term loan operating leases total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total amounts less in thousands committed than year years years years and over guarantee the term loan includes a million loan from the bank of china and it includes an interest free vehicle financing of  the operating leases include a lease for our factory in manila and our ground lease in tempe  arizona 
these leases are described in detail in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for included elsewhere in this form k 
the guarantee relates to our guarantee in connection with a small business administration loan to voiceviewer technology  inc  a private company developing microdisplay products 
the million standby letter of credit issued by comerica has not been included in the other commercial commitments table because it only exists to secure the term loan obligation of million  which is already included in the table for contractual obligations 
in september  we purchased the assets and ongoing business of avt 
the purchase agreement calls for a residual purchase payment of million should the avt division achieve certain revenue and profit objectives for and in january  we signed licensing and manufacturing agreements with data international co  ltd 
of taiwan 
the cost of the license is anticipated to be million of which million was paid upon signing and the other million is due over the next two years 
the unpaid million is subject to reduction if certain revenue and margin targets are not met 
we have no other long term debt  capital lease obligations  unconditional purchase obligations  or other long term obligations  and we do not have any other commercial commitments or other off balance sheet arrangements 
we believe that our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents  and investments will provide adequate sources to fund our operations and planned expenditures through and  as well as to meet our contractual obligations 
specifically  we have over million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
our capital expenditures for are expected to be less than million  and we expect operating cash outflow to consume only a small portion of our cash reserves 
we continue to seek other alliances or acquisitions and additional relationships with regard to the strategic development of both business segments 
new acquisitions or alliances may result in our needing to expand our loan commitments or pursue alternate methods of financing or raise capital 
we cannot provide assurance that adequate additional loan commitments or alternative methods of financing will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms acceptable to us

prohibits companies from utilizing the prospective method of transition  the only method offered under the original sfas no 
 in fiscal years beginning after december  however  the statement permits two additional transition methods for companies that adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  which include the modified prospective and retroactive restatement methods 
under the prospective method  expense is recognized for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied 
the modified prospective method recognizes stock based employee compensation cost from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the provisions are first applied  as if the fair value method had been used to account for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  under the retroactive restatement method  all periods presented are restated to reflect stock based employee compensation cost under the fair value method for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results using a prescribed tabular format and requiring disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies or its equivalent 
we have adopted the new disclosure requirements for  and are currently evaluating the impact if we were to adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under all three methods 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements and its obligations under guarantees 
the interpretation also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by the guarantor at the inception of a guarantee 
per the interpretation  initial recognition of a liability shall be applied only on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we have reviewed the requirements of fin and believe the adoption of this interpretation will not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents rule b trading plans our insider trading policy permits our directors  officers  and other key personnel to establish purchase and sale programs in accordance with rule b adopted by the securities and exchange commission 
the rule permits employees to adopt written plans at a time before becoming aware of material nonpublic information and to sell shares according to a plan on a regular basis for example  weekly or monthly  regardless of any subsequent nonpublic information they receive 
in our view  rule b plans are beneficial because systematic  pre planned sales that take place over an extended period should have a less disruptive influence on the price of our stock 
we also believe plans of this type are beneficial because they inform the marketplace about the nature of the trading activities of our directors and officers 
in the absence of such information  the market could mistakenly attribute transactions as reflecting a lack of confidence in our company or an indication of an impending event involving our company 
we recognize that our directors and officers may have reasons totally apart from the company in determining to effect transactions in our common stock 
these reasons could include the purchase of a home  tax and estate planning  the payment of college tuition  the establishment of a trust  the balancing of assets  or other personal reasons 
the establishment of any trading plan involving our company requires the pre clearance by our chief executive officer or chief financial officer 
an individual adopting a trading plan must comply with all requirements of rule b  including the requirement that the individual not possess any material nonpublic information regarding our company at the time of the establishment of the plan 
in addition  sales under a trading plan may be made no earlier than days after the plan establishment date 
no officers currently maintain trading plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments at december   we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments  or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
we hold no investment securities that would require disclosure of market risk 
we have certain receivables denominated in chinese renminbi 
to eliminate our exposure to changes in the us dollar chinese renminbi exchange rate  we have entered into forward contracts to protect future cash flows 
we have designated the forward contracts as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  we account for changes in the fair value of our forward contracts  based on changes in the forward exchange rate  with all changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income 
amounts in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings upon settlement of the forward contract 
as of december   we had no forward contracts outstanding 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have a revolving line of credit with a variable interest rate of libor at december  plus basis points 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit 
we generally sell our products and services and negotiate purchase orders with our foreign suppliers in us dollars 
however  we have certain foreign currency exchange exposure as a result of our manufacturing operations in the philippines and china and our sales and distribution facility in the united kingdom 
we have not incurred any material exchange gains or losses to date 
some of the expenses of these foreign operations are denominated in the philippine peso  chinese renminbi  and british pound sterling  respectively 
these expenses include local salaries and wages  utilities  and some operating supplies 
as a result of these sales and expenses  we do have accounts receivable and cash deposits in local currencies 
we believe  however  that the operating expenses currently incurred in foreign currencies other than the chinese renminbi are immaterial  and therefore any associated market risk is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
although the chinese currency currently is stable  its value in relation to the us dollar is determined by the chinese government 
there is general speculation that china may devalue its currency 
devaluation of the chinese currency could result in translation adjustments to our balance sheet as well as reportable losses depending on our monetary balances and outstanding indebtedness at the time of devaluation 
the government of china historically has made it difficult to convert its local currency into foreign currencies 
although we from time to time may enter 
table of contents into hedging transactions in order to minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations  the chinese currency is not freely traded and thus is difficult to hedge 
in addition  the government of china has imposed restrictions on chinese currency loans to foreign operated entities in china 
based on the foregoing  we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations and currency exchange rates in the future will not have an adverse effect on our operations
