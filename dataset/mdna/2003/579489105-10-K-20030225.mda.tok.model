item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company owns and publishes newspapers in four regions of the country minnesota  california  the carolinas and the northwest alaska and washington 
the newspapers range from large dailies serving metropolitan areas to non daily newspapers serving small communities 
for the year ended december   the company had an average paid daily circulation of  sunday circulation of  and non daily circulation of  the company also owns and operates nando media  a national online publishing operation  and the newspaper network tnn  a national sales and marketing company 
in addition  the company is a partner interest in the ponderay newsprint company ponderay  a general partnership that owns and operates a newsprint mill in washington state 
the company supplements its newspaper publishing with a growing array of niche products and direct marketing initiatives  including direct mail 
the company also operates leading local websites in each of its daily newspaper markets offering readers information  comprehensive news  advertising  e commerce and other services 
critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the most significant areas involving estimates and assumptions are allowance for receivables  pension and post retirement expenses  incentive compensation  insurance reserves  environmental reserves  the company s tax provision  depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangibles 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  in addition to those described in note to our financial statements beginning on page of this filing  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition advertising revenues are recorded when advertisements are placed in the newspaper and circulation revenues are recorded as newspapers are delivered over the subscription term 
circulation revenues are recorded net of direct delivery costs 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
revenues are recorded net of estimated incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 

table of contents revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
bad debt the company maintains a reserve account for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company uses a combination of the percentage of sales and the aging of accounts receivable to establish reserves for losses on accounts receivable 
goodwill and intangible impairment in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  and analyzes its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
no impairment loss was recorded in fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed explanation of the company s intangible assets 
pension and post retirement benefits the company has significant pension and postretirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets 
for an explanation of these assumptions  see note to our consolidated financial statements and the discussion in recent events and trends below 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and postretirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future because of changes resulting from fluctuations in the company s employee headcount and or changes in the various assumptions 
self insurance the company is self insured for the majority of its group health insurance costs 
the company relies on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
recent events and trends employment classified advertising revenues and  to a lesser extent  national advertising revenues have seen significant declines over the last two years 
however  employment trends  while still negative  improved in fiscal employment advertising revenues declined only in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal and were down in the full year  compared to a decline in fiscal also  these declines have been offset somewhat by growth in certain other advertising categories 
please see the revenue discussions in management s review of its results below 
newsprint is the major component of the company s cost of raw materials and represented of the company s overall operating expenses in fiscal consequently  the company s earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices 
all other things being equal  a hypothetical per metric ton change in newsprint prices affects earnings per share by 
cents 
newsprint prices have remained below prior year levels throughout  resulting in a favorable expense variance 
however  an increase in newsprint prices was implemented in the fourth quarter of the company s newsprint suppliers have announced a per metric ton price increase for march  however  at this time it is 
table of contents uncertain whether the price increase will be effective at the time or in the amount indicated by the announcement 
the eventual timing and amount of any further changes in newsprint pricing is dependent on global demand and supply for newsprint 
the impact of newsprint price expense on the company s results of operations is discussed below 
due to continued poor performance of the equity markets  the value of our pension fund assets declined in us gaap requires the recognition of an additional liability if the market value of plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation at the end of the plan year 
based on the plans results  the company increased its pension liabilities to record a total of million of unfunded benefit obligations in and increased its comprehensive loss  which is a reduction to stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet  by million after tax 
the liability is largely recorded in other long term obligations  and the adjustment of comprehensive loss did not affect net income 
during the company made a voluntary cash contribution of million to its defined benefit pension plans and made additional contributions of million in early the company may make additional voluntary contributions to the plans in given current economic conditions  the company has reduced its discount rate to from used to value its benefit obligations at year end to reflect current lower interest rates  and reduced the assumed long term return on assets to in from used in the reduction in the return on asset rate was made after a review of historical returns of equity and fixed income indices over a and year history and given the roughly equity and fixed income mix of the company s qualified pension plans assets  and consultation with the company s actuaries 
these changes are expected to increase retirement expenses in by an estimated million to million 
also  given the increase in medical costs  the company anticipates that health care expenses could rise between million and million in in fiscal the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for the acquisition of intangible assets outside of a business combination and for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
this accounting standard requires that goodwill be separately disclosed from other intangible assets in the statement of financial position  no longer amortized  and tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
the provisions of this accounting standard also require the completion of a transitional impairment test with any impairments identified treated as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
no material adjustments to the consolidated financial statements were necessary as a result of this transitional impairment test 
the company owns certain real property that was previously held for sale  which it now plans to retain and use for at least several years 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million to record the property at its historical carrying value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which was effective in 
table of contents results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net income in the fiscal year was million  up  or per share compared to the fiscal year earnings of million  or per share 
fiscal earnings included a pre tax charge of million to write down the value of certain real property as discussed above 
the fiscal year earnings would have been per share with the application of sfas no 
which would have eliminated goodwill amortization had it been in place during that year 
see the discussion under operating expenses and income tax provision below  and note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of sfas no 
on the company s year to date expenses and financial position

at december   the company s bank debt includes term loans consisting of tranche a of million bearing interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points  payable in increasing quarterly installments through march   and tranche b of million bearing interest at libor plus basis points and payable in semi annual installments through september  a revolving credit line of up to million  of which million was outstanding at december   bears interest at libor plus basis points and is payable by march  interest rates applicable to debt drawn down at december   ranged from to 

table of contents the terms of the credit agreement include certain operating and financial restrictions  such as limits on the company s ability to incur additional debt  create liens  sell assets  engage in mergers  make investments and pay dividends 
the debt is unsecured and is pre payable without penalty 
at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling million securing estimated obligations stemming from workers compensation claims and other contingent claims 
the company had million of available credit under its current credit agreement at december the company does not have  nor does it intend to enter into  derivative contracts for trading purposes 
the company has not attempted to hedge fluctuations in the normal purchases of goods and services used to conduct its business operations 
currently there is no intent to hedge or enter into contracts with embedded derivatives for the purchase of newsprint  ink  and other inventories  leases of equipment and facilities  or business insurance contracts 
the company utilizes interest rate protection agreements swaps to help maintain the overall interest rate risk parameters set by management 
none of these agreements were entered into for trading purposes 
the swap instruments were entered into to match the significant terms of the underlying debt in an effort to provide highly effective hedges 
the company has four interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges specifically designed to hedge interest rate fluctuations on million of its variable rate bank debt through june  and million through june the effect of these agreements is to fix the libor interest rate exposure at approximately on that portion of the company s term loans 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands of dollars payment due by period total year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt operating leases total other commercial commitments interest rate swaps a standby letters of credit b guarantees c total nil a amounts reflect the fair value should the swaps be terminated  however  the company does not currently intend to terminate its swaps prior to their normal maturity date 
b in connection with the company s insurance program  letters of credit are required to support certain projected claims and obligations 
c the company guarantees of the debt of ponderay 
the company also has purchase commitments that are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents while the company expects that most of its cash generated from operations in the foreseeable future will be used to repay debt  management believes that the company s operating cash flow and its credit facilities as described above are adequate to meet its liquidity needs  including currently planned capital expenditures  pension contributions and future investments 
approval of audit and non audit services the company s general policy is that all audit and non audit services provided to the company by deloitte touche llp  the company s outside auditors  are reviewed and  if practicable and appropriate  pre approved by the audit committee of our board of directors 
risk factors that could affect operating results forward looking information this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements regarding the company s actual and expected financial performance and operations 
these statements are based upon our current expectations and knowledge of factors impacting our business  including  without limitation  statements about return on pension plan assets and assumed salary increases  newsprint costs  amortization expense  use of derivative instruments  prepayment of debt  capital expenditures  sufficiency of capital resources and possible acquisitions 
such statements are subject to risks  trends and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are generally preceded by  followed by or are a part of sentences that include the words believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  or similar expressions 
for those statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of you should understand that the following important factors  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this document and in the documents which we incorporate by reference  could affect the future results of mcclatchy  and could cause those future results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements general economic  market or business conditions  especially in any of the markets where we operate newspapers  geo political uncertainties including the risk of war  changes in newsprint prices and or printing and distribution costs from anticipated levels  changes in interest rates  changes in pension assets and liabilities  increased competition from other forms of media in our principal markets  increased consolidation among major retailers in our newspaper markets or other events depressing the level of advertising  changes in our ability to negotiate and obtain favorable terms under collective bargaining arrangements with our employees  competitive actions by other companies  difficulties in servicing our debt obligations  other occurrences leading to decreased circulation and diminished revenues from both display and classified advertising  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
additional information regarding certain risks newsprint is the major component of our cost of raw materials 
newsprint accounted for of mcclatchy s operating expenses in fiscal accordingly  our earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices 
we have not attempted to hedge fluctuations in the normal purchases of newsprint or enter into contracts with embedded derivatives for the purchase of newsprint 
if the price of newsprint increases materially  our operating results could be adversely affected 
for a discussion of the impact of a change in newsprint prices on the company s earnings per share  please see the newsprint discussion above at recent events and trends 

table of contents if mcclatchy experiences labor unrest  our ability to produce and deliver newspapers would be impaired 
the results of future labor negotiations could harm our operating results 
our newspapers have not endured a labor strike since however  we cannot ensure that a strike will not occur at one or more of our newspapers in the future 
as of december   approximately a quarter of our full and part time employees were represented by unions 
most of the company s union represented employees are currently working under labor agreements  which expire at various times 
mcclatchy faces collective bargaining upon the expirations of these labor agreements 
even if our newspapers do not suffer a labor strike  the company s operating results could be harmed if the results of labor negotiations restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of its newspaper operations 
changes in the regulatory and technological environment are bringing about consolidation of media companies and convergence among various forms of media 
these changes are expected to continue or accelerate as a result of anticipated loosening of regulatory constraints by the federal communications commission 
the company faces competition with larger and more diversified entities for circulation and advertising revenues and further industry consolidation will likely increase this competition 
such consolidation could also affect the company s opportunities to make acquisitions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to normal business risks discussed above  the company utilizes interest rate protection agreements swaps to help maintain the overall interest rate risk parameters set by management 
none of these agreements was entered into for trading purposes 
the company has four interest rate swap agreements totaling million designated as cash flow hedges specifically designed to hedge the variability in the expected cash flows that are attributable to interest rate fluctuations on million of its variable rate bank debt through june  and million through june the effect of these agreements is to fix the london interbank offered rate libor interest rate exposure on these borrowings at approximately on that portion of the company s term loans 
all things being equal  a hypothetical basis point change in libor for a fiscal year would have a per share increase or decrease in the company s annual results of operations 
it would also impact the fair values of its market risk sensitive financial instruments  but would not materially affect the company s financial position taken as a whole
