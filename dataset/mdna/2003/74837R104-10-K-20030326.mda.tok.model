item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information certain statements contained in this annual report and other materials we file with the securities and exchange commission  as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us  other than statements of historical fact  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements may relate to a variety of matters not currently ascertainable  such as future capital expenditures  drilling activity  acquisitions and dispositions  development or exploratory activities  cost savings efforts  production activities and volumes  hydrocarbon reserves  hydrocarbon prices  hedging activities and the results thereof  financing plans  liquidity  regulatory matters  competition and our ability to realize efficiencies related to certain transactions or organizational changes 
forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as anticipate  believe  budgeted  expect  intend  plan  project  potential  or similar statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove correct 
factors that could cause our results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements include fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices  failure or delays in achieving expected production from oil and gas development projects  
table of contents uncertainties inherent in predicting oil and gas reserves and oil and gas reservoir performance  the effects of existing and future laws and governmental regulations  liability resulting from litigation  world economic and political conditions  changes in tax and other laws applicable to our business  and certain factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
all forward looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this section 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies  practices and estimates described below 
we believe the reported financial results are reliable and that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported 
oil and gas properties we employ the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas production assets 
under the full cost method  all costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized and accumulated in cost centers on a country by country basis 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs for each cost center is depleted on the equivalent unit of production basis using proved oil and gas reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of related deferred tax or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of i estimated future net revenues  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on unescalated year end prices and costs  ii the cost of properties not being amortized  iii the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  less iv income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and gas properties 
such limitations are imposed separately for the us and canadian cost centers 
the ceiling test is affected by a decrease in net cash flow from reserves due to higher operating or finding costs or reduction in market prices for natural gas and crude oil 
these changes can reduce the amount of economically producible reserves 
at december   the capitalized cost  inclusive of future development costs  for us and canadian reserves was per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
if the cost center ceiling falls below the capitalized cost for the cost center  we would be required to report an impairment of the cost center s oil and gas assets at the reporting date 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when title to the product transfers to purchasers 
we follow the sales method of accounting for revenue for natural gas and crude oil production  so that we recognize sales revenue on all production sold to purchasers  regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to our ownership in the property 
a receivable or liability is recognized only to the extent that we have an imbalance on a specific property greater than the expected remaining proved reserves 
ultimate revenues from the sales of natural gas and crude oil production is not known with certainty until up to three months after production and title transfer occur 
current revenues are accrued based on our expectation of actual deliveries and actual prices received 

table of contents hedging we enter into financial derivative instruments to hedge risk associated with the prices received from natural gas and crude oil production and marketing 
we also utilize financial derivative instruments to hedge the risk associated with interest rates on our debt outstanding 
every derivative instrument is recorded on our balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value determined by reference to published future market prices and interest rates 
the cash settlement of all derivative instruments is recognized as income or expense in the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized 
the ineffective portion of hedges is recognized currently in earnings 
accounting and disclosure rules relating to derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges require us to increase our reported stockholders equity when future natural gas prices are forecasted to decrease relative to the strike price in our hedges  and to decrease our reported stockholders equity when future natural gas and crude oil prices increase relative to the strike price in our hedges 
the change in reported stockholders equity relates only to our hedged production 
future declines in natural gas and crude oil prices are not beneficial to us since less than of our production is hedged and even though hedge accounting rules require us to increase our book value 
income taxes included in our net deferred tax liability are million of future tax benefits from prior unused tax losses 
realization of these tax assets depends on sufficient future taxable income before the benefits expire 
we believe we will have sufficient future taxable income to utilize the loss carry forward benefits before they expire  however  if not  we could be required to recognize a loss for some or all of these tax assets 
internal revenue code section income tax credits expired at the end of during  and  we recorded revenue of million  million and million  respectively  from section credits 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  financing partnerships or guarantees 
the companies that we have an equity investment in do not have any significant debts

revenue derived from section tax credit monetizations decreased million from deferred revenue recognition associated with the tax credit monetization ceased during natural gas marketing  transportation and processing revenue for was million as compared to million in the decrease was due primarily to lower gas marketing margins and less marketed volumes in other revenue in also decreased due to the one time receipt of  of revenue recognized in as a result of a bankruptcy settlement 
operating expenses operating expenses were million in compared to million for the decrease was the result of lower sales volumes  including the absence of payout volumes  and cost reduction measures we instituted early in resulting in a decrease in lease operating expense and production overhead of million 
additional expense recoveries of million were the result of review of various operating agreements under which we operate both oil and gas properties and other partnerships 
the review resulted in an increase of expenses recovered from the oil and gas properties and partnerships

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash during were cash provided by operations  the issuance of common stock in a public offering  the exercise of warrants and employee stock options  and proceeds from utilization of our credit facility 
primary cash outflows for the year were capital expenditures and the repayment of debt 
internal revenue code section income tax credits expired at the end of  and  unless new legislation extends the credits  this source of income will no longer be available to us 
during  and  we recorded revenue of million  million and million  respectively  from section credits 
of these amounts  million  million and million represent cash revenue for  and  respectively 
cash from operations of million was million less than lower sales prices and volumes reduced operating cash by million while lower production costs and interest expense offset the revenue reduction by million 
unfavorable changes in working capital and the receipt of million from the settlement of the bankruptcy of a former natural gas producer further reduced cash from operations in as compared to our principal operating sources of cash include sales of natural gas  crude oil and ngls and revenues from natural gas transportation and processing 
we sold approximately and of our natural gas and crude oil production  respectively  under long term contracts with price floors and financial hedges 
as a result  we benefit from significant predictability of our natural gas and crude oil revenues 
however  when natural gas and crude oil market prices exceed our financial hedge swap prices  we are required to make payment for the settlement of our hedge derivatives on the fifth day of the production month for natural gas hedges and the fifth day after the production month for crude oil hedges 
we do not receive market price cash payment from our customers until to days after the month of production 
additionally  in the event of a significant production 
table of contents curtailment  we are required contractually to fulfill our commitments under our long term sales contracts by purchasing natural gas volumes at market prices 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows 
cash used in investing activities was million for  an increase of million from capital expenditures in were million higher due primarily to the purchase of michigan natural gas interests from enogex in december for approximately million million after estimated closing adjustments 
cash from equity affiliates and the sale of properties in wyoming and texas partially offset capital expenditures

the million of net proceeds from notes payable under our credit facility was offset by the payments made to reduce term debt and the costs associated with renewing our credit facility in may our credit facility is a three year revolving facility that matures on may  and permits us to obtain revolving credit loans and to issue letters of credit for our account from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed the lessor of the borrowing base or million 
the current borrowing base is million and is subject to semi annual redetermination and certain other redeterminations based upon several factors 
scheduled redeterminations occur on may and november of each year 
our borrowing base is impacted by  among other factors  the fair value of our oil and gas reserves 
changes in the fair value of our oil and gas reserves are affected by prices for natural gas and crude oil  operating expenses and the results of our drilling activity 
a significant decline in the fair value of our reserves could reduce our borrowing base 
a borrowing base reduction could limit our ability to carry out our capital expenditure programs and possibly require the repayment of a portion of our current bank borrowings 

table of contents at our option  loans may be prepaid  and revolving credit commitments may be reduced in whole or in part at any time in minimum amounts

we received million  which is being amortized through the original termination date of the hedge  march  on march   the holders of the subordinated notes were notified that we intend to exercise our prepayment option for all of the subordinated notes outstanding 
in addition to the principal and accrued interest  we will pay a premium of million on june  we plan to finance the repayment with issuance of million of term debt to be repaid over three and one half years at an interest rate of approximately 
the remaining million of principal and premium is expected to be financed through the credit facility 
we believe that our capital resources are adequate to meet the requirements of our business 
we anticipate our capital expenditure budget of approximately million  including million for possible leasehold acquisitions and new projects  will be funded by cash flow from operations  credit facility utilization and possible issuance of common stock under a shelf registration statement filing made in if capital resources are inadequate or unavailable  we may curtail our acquisition  development and exploration drilling and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis

recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement  effective in  establishes accounting and reporting standards for the legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction or development and the normal operation of long lived assets 
it requires that the fair value of the liability for asset retirement obligations shall be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
upon initial recognition of the asset retirement liability  an asset retirement cost shall be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement  the asset retirement cost shall be allocated to expense using a systematic method over the asset s useful life 
changes in the liability for the asset retirement obligation shall be recognized for a the passage of time and b revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
all asset retirement obligations and costs were identified and their fair values estimated as of the date the long lived assets were placed into service 
the asset retirement obligations fair values were then estimated as of january   the date of adoption of the statement 
our adoption of this accounting standard as of january  resulted in the recognition of million of asset retirement costs and million of asset retirement obligations 
the cumulative effect adjustment of million includes million for additional depletion and depreciation of the asset retirement costs  million for accretion of the fair value of the asset retirement obligations and million for deferred tax benefits 
in  we estimate the additional expense for depletion  depreciation and accretion to be million before income taxes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have established policies and procedures for managing risk within our organization  including internal controls 
the level of risk assumed by us is based on our objectives and capacity to manage risk 
our primary risk exposure is related to natural gas and crude oil commodity prices 
we have mitigated the downside risk of adverse price movements through the use of swaps  futures and forward contracts  however  we have also limited future gains from favorable movements 
commodity price risk we enter into various contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas and crude oil production 
these contracts have included physical sales contracts and derivatives including price ceilings and floors  no cost collars and fixed price swaps 
as of december   we sell approximately  mcfd and  mcfd of natural gas under long term contracts with floor prices of per mcf and per mcf  respectively  through march approximately  mcfd of our natural gas production was sold under these contracts during the remaining  mcfd sold under these contracts were third party volumes controlled by us 
approximately  mcfd of our natural gas production is hedged using fixed price swap agreements at a weighted average price of per mcf 
these agreements expire from april to april additionally  we have hedged bbld of our crude oil production using a fixed price swap agreement and  bbld of crude oil using crude oil collars 
these agreements expire in september and december  respectively 
as a result of these various contracts  we benefit from significant predictability of our natural gas and crude oil revenues

as a result of the hedging programs  revenues from production were lower than if the hedging program had not been in effect by million in  million in  and million in commodity price fluctuations affect our remaining natural gas and crude oil volumes as well as our ngl volumes 
up to  mcfd of natural gas is committed at market price through may additional natural gas volumes of  mcfd are committed at market price through september during  approximately  mcfd of our natural gas production was sold under these contracts 
an additional  mcfd sold under these contracts were third party volumes controlled by us 
based on the natural gas financial fixed price hedge positions  for each per mcf increase in the price of natural gas  our annualized revenue would increase by approximately million of which million would be reduced due to the existing hedges 
cinnabar energy services trading  llc  our wholly owned marketing company  also enters into various financial contracts to hedge its exposure to commodity price risk associated with future contractual natural gas sales and purchases of third party volumes 
these contracts include either fixed and floating price sales or purchases from third parties 
as a result of these firm sale and purchase commitments and associated financial price swaps  the hedge derivatives have qualified as fair value hedges 
marketing revenues were lower by million in and million in as a result of hedging activities

the net differential between the prices in each derivative and commitment and market prices for future periods  as adjusted for estimated basis  has been applied to the volumes stipulated in each contract to arrive at an estimated future value 
this estimated future value was discounted on each contract at rates commensurate with federal treasury instruments with similar contractual lives 
as a result  the fair value of the company s derivatives and commitments does not necessarily represent the value a third party would pay to assume our contract positions 
interest rate risk we manage our exposure associated with interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps 
in october  we closed our fixed rate interest swaps related to million of our variable rate debt and entered into a new fixed rate swap 
the new fixed rate swap converts the debt s floating libor base to a fixed rate through march  the realized loss of million on the closed swaps is being reclassified out of other comprehensive income through march   the original maturity of the closed swaps 
in july  we closed our variable rate interest swap covering the million of our fixed rate subordinated notes 
the swap converted the debt s fixed rate debt to a floating three month libor base 
we received a cash settlement of million 
the settlement was deferred and is being recognized as a reduction of interest expense through march   the original life of the swap 
interest expense for the years ended december  and was million and million higher  respectively  as a result of the interest rate swaps 
if interest rates on our unhedged variable debt of million increase or decrease by one percentage point  our annual pretax income will decrease or increase by million 

table of contents credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
we sell a portion our natural gas production directly under long term natural gas contracts and the remainder of our natural gas and crude oil is sold through cinnabar 
all such natural gas and crude oil is sold to creditworthy counterparties  such as utilities  major oil and gas companies or their affiliates  industrial customers  large trading companies or energy marketing companies  refineries and other users of petroleum products 
we also enter into hedge derivatives with financial counterparties 
we monitor exposure to counterparties by reviewing credit ratings  financial statements and credit service reports 
exposure levels are limited and parental guarantees are required according to company policy 
in this manner we reduce credit risk 
while we follow our credit policies at the time we enter into sales contracts  the credit worthiness of counterparties could change over time 
in fact  credit ratings of the parent companies of the two counterparties to our long term gas contracts were recently downgraded by standard poors and moody s 
please see item risk factors 
performance risk performance risk results when a financial counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligations such as commodity pricing or volume commitments 
typically  such risk obligations are defined within the trading agreements 
we manage performance risk through management of credit risk
