item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction ari was organized in in august  ari acquired art and nrlp

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of ari s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgements 
ari s critical accounting policies relate to the evaluation of impairment of long lived assets and the evaluation of the collectibility of accounts and notes receivable 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property to be held and used or land held for development may be impaired  management performs a recoverability analysis based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the property in the future 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the property is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
if management decides to sell rental properties or land held for development  management evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from estimated net sales proceeds  the property is written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell and an impairment loss is recognized within income from continuing operations 
ari s estimates of cash flow and fair values of the properties are based on current market conditions and consider matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties  recent sales data for comparable properties and  where applicable  contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers 
ari s estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and ari s assessments of them change 
in the third quarter of  ari recognized asset impairments of  in the fourth quarter of  ari recognized asset impairments of million 
ari s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable is established based on analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts 
management considers such information as the nature and age of the receivable  the payment history of the tenant or other debtor  the financial condition of the tenant or other debtor and ari s assessment of its ability to meet its lease or interest obligations 
ari s estimate of the required allowance  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis  is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions

liquidity and capital resources general 
cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million  compared with  at december  although ari anticipates that during it will generate excess cash from operations  as discussed below  such excess cash is not sufficient to discharge all of ari s debt obligations as they mature 
ari will therefore again rely on externally generated funds  including aggressive land sales  selected sales of income producing properties  borrowings against its investments in various real estate entities  refinancing of properties and  to the extent necessary  borrowings to meet its debt service obligations  pay taxes  interest and other non property related expenses

ari expects that funds from existing cash resources  aggressive sales of land and selected income producing property sales  refinancing of real estate  and borrowings against its real estate will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements associated with ari s current and anticipated level of operations  maturing debt obligations and existing commitments 
to the extent that ari s liquidity permits or financing sources are available  ari will make investments in real estate  primarily in improved and unimproved land  will continue making investments in real estate entities and marketable equity securities  and will develop and construct income producing properties

see item business for discussion of the tender offer for shares of tci and iori common stock by ari 
equity securities of iori and tci held by ari may be deemed to be restricted securities under rule of the securities act of securities act 
accordingly  ari may be unable to sell such equity securities other than in a registered public offering or pursuant to an exemption under the securities act for a one year period after they are acquired 
such restrictions may reduce ari s ability to realize the full fair market value of such investments if ari attempted to dispose of such securities in a short period of time 
ari s cash flow from these investments is dependent on the ability of each of iori and tci to make distributions

management reviews the carrying values of ari s properties and mortgage notes receivable at least annually and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
impairment is considered to exist if  in the case of a property  the future cash flow from the property undiscounted and without interest is less than the carrying amount of the property 
for notes receivable impairment is considered to exist if it is probable that all amounts due under the terms of the note will not be collected 
if impairment is found to exist  a provision for loss is recorded by a charge against earnings to the extent that the investment in the note exceeds management s estimate of the fair value of the collateral securing such note 
the mortgage note receivable review includes an evaluation of the collateral property securing each note 
the property review generally includes selective property inspections  a review of the property s current rents compared to market rents  a review of the property s expenses  a review of maintenance requirements  a review of the property s cash flow  discussions with the manager of the property  and a review of properties in the surrounding area
