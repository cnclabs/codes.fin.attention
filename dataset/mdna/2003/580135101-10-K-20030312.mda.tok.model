strategic actions in  the company initiated several strategic actions designed to optimize existing restaurant operations and improve the business 
these actions were consistent with management s strategy of concentrating its capital and resources on the best near term opportunities and of avoiding those that distract from restaurant level execution 
they included the restructuring of certain markets  the closing of a significant number of underperforming restaurants  the decision to terminate a long term technology project  and the consolidation of certain home office facilities and elimination of positions to control costs  streamline operations and reallocate resources 
in  the company implemented strategic changes and restaurant initiatives in the us and certain international markets 
the changes in the us included streamlining operations by reducing the number of regions and divisions  enabling the company to combine staff functions and improve efficiency 
the company recorded charges and or gains associated with these actions in and as significant items 
significant items generally represent charges and or gains for actions or transactions related to the implementation of special initiatives of the company or items that are unusual or infrequent in nature 
the company does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends  because management does not believe these are indicative of ongoing operations 
the company recorded million of significant items in and million of significant items in all significant items for both years were recorded in other operating expense  except as noted in the discussion that follows

restructuring charges restructuring markets and eliminating positions in  the company recorded million of pretax charges related to transferring ownership in four countries in the middle east and latin america to developmental licensees approximately restaurants  ceasing operations in three countries in latin america approximately restaurants  and eliminating positions approximately positions  about half of which were in the us and half of which were in international markets  reallocating resources and consolidating certain home office facilities to control costs 
under the developmental license business structure  which the company successfully employs in more than markets outside the us approximately restaurants  the licensee owns the business  including the real estate interest 
while the company generally does not have any capital invested in these markets  it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales 
the restructuring charges consisted of million of asset write offs and losses on the sale of assets and million of costs for leases and other obligations in the markets restructured or exited  million of severance and other employee related costs  million of lease cancellation and other costs related to the closing of certain home office facilities  and million of payments made to facilitate a change of ownership from us franchisees who have had a history of financial difficulty and consequently were unable to deliver the level of operational excellence needed to succeed in the future 
these changes were partially offset by a million reversal of accrued restructuring costs recorded in  primarily due to lower employee related costs than originally estimated 
in  the company recorded million of pretax restructuring charges related to the strategic changes and restaurant initiatives in the us and certain international markets 
the initiatives were designed to improve the restaurant experience and included accelerated operations training  restaurant simplification  incentives for outstanding restaurant operations and an enhanced national restaurant evaluation system 
in connection with these initiatives  the company eliminated approximately positions  consisting of positions in the us  primarily in the divisions and regions  and positions in international markets 
the restructuring charges consisted of million of severance and other employee related costs  million of lease cancellation and other costs related to the closing of region and division facilities  and million of other cash costs  primarily consisting of payments made to facilitate a change of ownership from us franchisees who have had a history of financial difficulty and consequently were unable to deliver the level of operational excellence needed to succeed in the future 
restaurant closings asset impairment in  the company recorded million of pretax charges consisting of million related to management s decision to close underperforming restaurants were closed in and will close throughout primarily in the us and japan  and million primarily related to the impairment of assets for certain existing restaurants in europe and latin america 
most of the restaurants identified for closing had negative cash flows and or very low annual sales volumes 
also  in many cases they would have required significant capital investment over the next several years to remain financially viable 
in  the company recorded million of pretax charges consisting of million related to the closing of underperforming restaurants in international markets in  a million asset impairment charge due to an assessment of the ongoing impact of turkey s significant currency devaluation on our business  and million related to the disposition of aroma caf in the uk although restaurant closings occur each year  these and restaurant closing charges are identified as significant items because they were the result of separate intensive reviews by management in conjunction with other strategic actions 
technology write offs and other charges in  the company recorded million of pretax charges consisting of million primarily related to the write off of software development costs as a result of management s decision to terminate a long term technology project  and million primarily related to the write off of receivables and inventory in venezuela as a result of the temporary closure of all mcdonald s restaurants due to the national strike that began in early december 
although the terminated technology project was projected to deliver long term benefits  it was no longer viewed as the best use of capital in the current environment  as the anticipated systemwide cost over several years was expected to be in excess of billion 
in  the company recorded million of pretax charges consisting of million primarily related to the write off of certain technology  million recorded in nonoperating expense primarily related to the write off of a corporate investment  and million primarily related to the unrecoverable costs incurred in connection with the theft of winning game pieces from the company s monopoly and certain other promotional games over an extended period of time  and the related termination of the supplier of the game pieces

effect of foreign currencies on reported results while changing foreign currencies affect reported results  mcdonald s lessens exposures  where practical  by financing in local currencies  hedging certain foreign denominated cash flows and by purchasing goods and services in local currencies 
effect of foreign currency translation on consolidated reported results positive negative dollars in millions  except per share data revenues operating income net income net income per common share diluted 


in  foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on the revenue growth rate as the stronger euro and british pound were offset by weaker latin american currencies primarily the argentine peso  brazilian real and venezuelan bolivar 
the operating income growth rate for was positively impacted by foreign currency translation primarily due to the stronger euro and british pound 
in  foreign currency translation had a negative impact on the growth rates primarily due to the weaker euro  british pound  australian dollar  japanese yen and canadian dollar 
all information presented in constant currencies excludes the effect of foreign currency translation on reported results except for hyperinflationary economies  whose functional currency is the us dollar 
constant currency results are calculated by translating the current year results at prior year average exchange rates 
systemwide sales systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants  whether operated by the company  by franchisees or by affiliates operating under joint venture agreements 
management believes that systemwide sales information is useful in analyzing the company s revenues because franchisees and affiliates pay rent  service fees and or royalties that generally are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum payments

restaurant expansion  partly offset by negative comparable sales  drove the consolidated constant currency sales increases in and sales in the us increased in and due to expansion 
results in reflected the overall slowdown in the restaurant industry and increased competition 
the primary contributors to europe s constant currency sales growth in both years were france and russia 
in addition  the uk contributed to the increases in and  although comparable sales were negative in both years 
europe s results for both years were impacted by negative comparable sales in germany  where the economy continued to contract 
we expect the difficult economic conditions in germany to continue in the near term 
in  despite the company s outstanding quality and safety record  europe s results were negatively impacted by consumer confidence issues regarding the european beef supply in several markets 
sales results in apmea declined in in constant currencies primarily due to negative comparable sales in japan  which were in part due to continuing weak economic conditions  partly offset by a strong performance in australia and expansion in china 
in  the constant currency sales increase was driven by strong results in china  partly offset by weak results in japan  taiwan and turkey  and weak consumer spending in australia 
beginning in late and continuing in  sales were also dampened by consumer confidence issues regarding food safety throughout japan 
in latin america  constant currency sales increased in both and  despite the fact that many markets continued to be impacted by weak economic conditions 
the increase in was primarily due to positive comparable sales in brazil and expansion in mexico  while in positive comparable sales in mexico and venezuela drove the increase 
the company expects the weak economic conditions in many markets in apmea including japan and latin america to continue in the near term 
in canada  constant currency sales increased in due to expansion  partly offset by negative comparable sales  while the constant currency sales increase was driven by positive comparable sales and expansion 
the sales increase in partner brands in was primarily due to expansion and positive comparable sales at chipotle 
the sales increase in was primarily due to the acquisition of boston market in second quarter in addition  expansion of chipotle along with strong comparable sales at chipotle and boston market helped drive the increase in comparable sales mcdonald s restaurants increase decrease us europe apmea latin america canada brand mcdonald s average annual sales mcdonald s restaurants average sales per restaurant in constant currencies are affected by comparable sales as well as the size  location and number of new restaurants 
the number of new restaurants affects average sales because new restaurants typically take a few years to reach long term sales volumes 
in addition  over the last several years more restaurants outside the us have opened in less populated areas and in countries with lower average sales volumes and correspondingly lower average development costs 
average annual sales mcdonald s restaurants constant currency increase decrease as reported amounts dollars in thousands per restaurant traditional us    europe    apmea    latin america   canada    satellite us outside the us mcdonald s restaurants in operation at least consecutive months 
excludes the effect of foreign currency translation on reported results 
satellite restaurants are primarily located in japan and canada 
in  average annual sales per traditional restaurant in the us declined slightly primarily due to negative comparable sales 
in europe  average annual sales per traditional restaurant were relatively flat in constant currencies 
in apmea and canada  average annual sales per traditional restaurant declined in constant currencies primarily due to negative comparable sales and the impact of new restaurants 
in latin america  average annual sales per traditional restaurant increased slightly in constant currencies due to positive comparable sales 
all segments benefited from the closing of underperforming restaurants in and in  average annual sales per traditional restaurant were relatively flat for the us and canada in constant currencies 
in other segments  negative comparable sales and the significant number of new restaurants  partly offset by the benefit of closing underperforming restaurants  drove the decreases in average annual sales per traditional restaurant 
satellite restaurants generally have significantly lower development costs and sales volumes than traditional restaurants 
the use of these small  limited menu restaurants has allowed profitable expansion into areas that otherwise would not be feasible eg  discount retail stores and airports 
in and  average annual sales for satellite restaurants increased in the us this was due in part to our continued assessment of the appropriate use of these limited menu sites and the closing of certain low volume sites 
outside the us  average annual sales for satellite restaurants declined in constant currencies in both years primarily due to negative comparable sales in japan  where the majority of satellites outside the us are located 
in connection with the restaurant closings previously discussed  the company s japanese affiliate will close more than satellite restaurants in revenues revenues include sales by company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees or affiliates under joint venture agreements 
these fees include rent  service fees and or royalties that are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum payments along with initial fees 
fees vary by type of site and investment by the company and also according to local business conditions 
these fees  along with occupancy and operating rights  are stipulated in franchise agreements that generally have year terms 
revenues grow as sales build in existing restaurants and as new restaurants are added 
menu price changes also affect revenues and sales  but it is impractical to quantify their impact because of different pricing structures  new products  promotions and product mix variations among restaurants and markets 
systemwide sales and revenues may grow at different rates during a given period  primarily due to a change in the mix of company operated  franchised and affiliated restaurants 
for example  this mix is impacted by purchases and sales of restaurants between the company and franchisees 
company operated restaurants generated about of systemwide sales and about of revenues for all periods presented

on a constant currency basis  total revenues increased at a higher rate than systemwide sales in primarily due to significantly lower sales from our affiliate in japan 
under our affiliate structure  we record a royalty in revenues based on a percentage of japan s sales  whereas all of japan s sales are included in systemwide sales 
for this reason  japan s sales decline had a larger negative impact on systemwide sales than on revenues 
in  total revenues increased at a higher rate than systemwide sales primarily due to the second quarter acquisition of boston market restaurants  which were all company operated  and the restructuring of our ownership in the philippines  effective july  as a result of the restructuring  most of our restaurants in the philippines are now company operated rather than franchised 
in addition  revenues in benefited from an increase in the royalty percent received from our japanese affiliate  effective january  in the us  growth rates for systemwide sales and total revenues were similar in and in both periods  europe s total revenue growth rates were lower than the systemwide sales growth rates primarily due to a lower percentage of company operated restaurants and an increase in rent assistance to franchisees compared with the prior year 
apmea s total revenue growth rates were higher than the systemwide sales growth rates for both periods primarily due to our affiliate structure in japan and a higher percentage of company operated restaurants  in part due to the restructuring of the philippines 
in addition  the total revenue growth rate in benefited from an increase in the royalty percent received from our japanese affiliate

latin america s adjusted operating income declined significantly for both periods due to the continuing difficult economic conditions experienced by most markets in the segment
