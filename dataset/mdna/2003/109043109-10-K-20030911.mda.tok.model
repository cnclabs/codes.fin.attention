briggs stratton expects capital expenditures to be million in fiscal these anticipated expenditures reflect our plans to continue to reinvest in equipment  new products  and capacity enhancements 
it is currently briggs stratton s plan to use its available cash in fiscal to reduce the convertible senior notes due in management believes that available cash  the credit facility  cash generated from future operations  existing lines of credit and access to debt markets will be adequate to fund briggs stratton s capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
financial strategy management believes that the value of briggs stratton is enhanced if the capital invested in operations yields a cash return that is greater than the cost of capital 
consequently  management s first priority is to reinvest capital into physical assets and products that maintain or grow the global cost leadership and market positions that briggs stratton has achieved  and drive the economic value of the company 
management s next financial objective is to identify strategic acquisitions or alliances that enhance revenues and provide a superior economic return 
several successful joint ventures and the acquisition of bsppg are examples of our successful execution of this strategy 
finally  management believes that when capital cannot be invested for returns greater than the cost of capital  we should return capital to the capital providers 
this approach is apparent in the programs we executed to repurchase common stock from fiscal through  and our plans to reduce outstanding debt in fiscal by calling our convertible securities

emissions the us environmental protection agency epa has developed national emission standards under a two phase process for small air cooled engines 
briggs stratton currently has a complete product offering which complies with the epa s phase i engine emission standards 
the phase ii program imposes more stringent standards over the useful life of the engine and is being phased in through for class ii or greater cubic centimeter displacement engines and through for class i under cubic centimeter displacement engines 
the majority of briggs stratton s engines are certified to be compliant with the epa s phase ii standards 
accordingly  briggs stratton does not believe compliance with the new standards will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
the california air resources board carb staff have proposed tier regulations requiring additional reductions to engine exhaust emissions and also requiring new controls on evaporative emissions from small engines 
the carb staff proposal is phased in between and depending upon the size of the engine and type of control 
while briggs stratton believes the cost of the proposed regulation on a per engine basis is significant  briggs stratton does not believe the carb staff proposal will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations  given that california represents a relatively small percentage of briggs stratton s engine sales and that increased costs will be passed on to california consumers 
the european commission adopted an engine emission directive regulating exhaust emissions from engines manufactured by briggs stratton 
the european directive parallels the regulation previously promulgated by the us epa  therefore briggs stratton anticipates having a full product line offering which complies with stage i and ii of the directive 
briggs stratton does not believe compliance with the new directive will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies briggs stratton s critical accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the recovery of accounts receivable and inventory reserves  as well as those used in the determination of liabilities related to customer rebates  pension obligations  postretirement benefits  warranty  product liability  and taxation 
the reserves for customer rebates  warranty  product liability  inventory reserves and doubtful accounts are fact specific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations  historical experience  and current and expected economic conditions 
changes in these reserves may be required if actual experience differs from the original estimates 
the company s estimate of income taxes payable  deferred income taxes  and the effective tax rate is based on a complex analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal and state income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions  and current accounting standards 
we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 
in addition  federal and state taxing authorities periodically review the corporation s estimates and interpretation of income tax laws 
adjustments to the effective income tax rate and recorded assets and liabilities may occur in future periods if actual results differ significantly from original estimates and interpretations

the other postretirement benefits obligation and related expense charge are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the health care trend rate
