item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we own and operate full service  casual dining restaurants 
as of december   we operated restaurants 
in addition to these units  there were eight chart house restaurants operating but scheduled for closure and redevelopment into joe s crab shack restaurants 
in february  we acquired seafood restaurants located primarily in michigan and florida resulting from the acquisition of ca muer  inc  the muer acquisition 
in august  we purchased chart house seafood restaurants  located primarily on the east and west coasts of the united states 
both of these acquisitions included plans for the redevelopment of additional lower profitability restaurants  also then acquired  into joe s crab shack restaurants  and the sale or disposal of six additional acquired  but non strategic  locations 
in october  we purchased texas based saltgrass steak house restaurants 
the restaurant industry is intensely competitive and is affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national  regional  and local economic conditions and demographic trends 
the performance of individual restaurants may be affected by factors such as traffic patterns  demographic considerations  weather conditions  and the type  number  and location of competing restaurants 
we have many well established competitors with greater financial resources and longer histories of operation than ours  including competitors already established in regions where we are planning to expand  as well as competitors planning to expand in the same regions 
we face significant competition from mid priced  full service  casual dining restaurants offering seafood and other types and varieties of cuisine 
our competitors include national  regional  and local chains as well as local owner operated restaurants 
we also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for restaurant sites 
we intend to pursue an acquisition strategy 
results of operations restaurant profitability the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to total restaurant revenues of certain restaurant operating data for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues cost of revenues restaurant labor other restaurant operating expenses restaurant level profit year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues increased  or  from  to  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to revenues from new restaurant openings  a same store sales increase of for the company s seafood restaurants  offset by a slight decline in rainforest cafe restaurant revenues  and the inclusion of revenues from the muer since february  chart house since august and saltgrass steak house restaurants since october acquisitions 
the company s same store sales declined in the fourth quarter of  and management believes that comparisons for the first quarter of may be rather difficult in light of excellent prior year comparative same store sales results  unfavorable weather and a more difficult and competitive economic environment 
as a primary result of increased revenues  cost of revenues increased  or  from  to  in the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  decreased to from in the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues primarily reflects menu changes and lower product costs in as compared to  partially offset by the inclusion of saltgrass steak house restaurants since october with higher than company average cost of sales margins 
restaurant labor expenses increased  or  from  to  in the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
restaurant labor expenses as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december   increased to from in  as a primary result of higher labor costs at the restaurants purchased in recent acquisitions  partially offset by increases in hourly labor productivity 
other restaurant operating expenses increased  or  from  to  in the year ended december   compared to the prior year  principally as a result of increased revenues 
such expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in  as a primary result of higher marketing and advertising expenses  partially offset by lower utility costs 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  from  to  in the year ended december   compared to the prior year  and declined as a percentage of revenues to in from in the dollar increase resulted primarily from increased personnel to support our expanded operations 
the decrease as a percentage of revenues is the primary result of increased leverage from higher revenues increasing more than expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  or  from  to  in the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
the dollar increase was primarily due to the addition of new restaurants and equipment and the restaurant acquisitions in  and asset impairment charges of  in  compared to  in the decrease in net interest expense for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  is substantially due to reduced borrowings as a result from repayments using proceeds of a secondary stock offering we completed in april also  the average borrowing rate declined by approximately percentage points between december  to december  the change in other expense income  includes an unrealized gain on investments of  and additional income of  from a settlement from a vendor  offset by a loss of  on an asset in provision for income taxes increased by  to  in from  in primarily due to changes in our pre tax income 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues increased  or  from  to  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  revenues from new restaurant openings  a same store sales increase of  and the inclusion of revenues from rainforest cafe restaurants for the full year primarily attributed to the increase in revenues 
as a primary result of increased revenues  cost of revenues increased  or  from  to  in the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  decreased to from in the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues primarily reflects the inclusion of rainforest cafe restaurants with lower cost of revenues percentages  menu changes and lower product costs in as compared to restaurant labor expenses increased  or  from  to  in the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
restaurant labor expenses as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  increased to from in the inclusion of rainforest cafe units  which generally incur higher labor costs  and large initial staffing and training costs incurred following the opening of the rainforest cafe restaurant in anaheim  california primarily caused the increase in labor expense as a percentage of revenues 
other restaurant operating expenses increased  or  from  to  in the year ended december   compared to the prior year  principally as a result of increased revenues 
such expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in  as a primary result of the inclusion of rainforest cafe restaurants with higher occupancy expenses  and slight percentage increases in advertising and utility costs 
we anticipate advertising and marketing expenses may increase as a percentage of revenues in general and administrative expenses increased  or  from  to  in the year ended december   compared to the prior year  and remained flat as a percentage of revenues at 
the dollar increase resulted primarily from increased personnel to support the rainforest cafe restaurants 
we expect that the future rate of increase of general and administrative expenses will moderate in comparison to revenue increases 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  or  from  to  in the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of new restaurants and equipment and the inclusion of the rainforest cafe restaurants for the increase in net interest expense for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  is substantially due to increased borrowings for treasury stock repurchases and the rainforest cafe acquisition 
our average borrowing rate declined by approximately percentage points from december  to december  the change in other expense income  net was not deemed material 
provision for income taxes increased by  to  in from  in primarily due to changes in our pre tax income 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was reduced in the third and fourth quarter of and prospectively from to to reflect continuing favorable federal tax credits for tipped employees 
liquidity and capital resources in february  we completed our acquisition of ca muer restaurants  inc for approximately million  which was funded with borrowings from our credit line 
in april  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock and raised approximately million 
these proceeds were initially used to pay down the majority of amounts outstanding on our credit line 
in august  we acquired chart house restaurants and additional restaurant locations for million  plus assumptions of trade payables  which was funded with borrowings from our credit line 
in october  we purchased the unit saltgrass steak house and seafood chain for approximately million 
the acquisition was financed by borrowing on the credit facility and a million  year  note from the seller 
in october  we authorized a million open market stock buy back program 
our million line of credit from a syndicate of banks matures in july and is available for expansion  acquisitions  share repurchases and other general corporate purposes 
in july  the credit line was amended to permit the chart house and saltgrass acquisitions 
at december   we had million outstanding under this credit facility at an average interest rate of  and remaining availability of approximately million 
for the year ended december   we funded our capital expenditures of million and million in acquired restaurant properties muer  chart house and saltgrass steak house restaurants  out of existing cash balances  cash flows from operations  and borrowings 
we expect to spend approximately to million on capital expenditures in the majority of planned capital expenditures will be for restaurants that are expected to open in and  which include approximately to restaurants in  although a portion will be for land purchases  other entertainment and hospitality opportunities  and the completion of our downtown aquarium project in houston  texas 
in addition  we are renovating a building adjacent to the new houston professional baseball park and close to the houston convention center  into a room hotel as a part of our specialty growth opportunities 
expected construction costs of approximately million will be expended over several years 
further  we were awarded a contract from the city of galveston  texas to develop  construct and operate the galveston island convention center 
the estimated construction costs are being funded by proceeds from governmental agency bonds issued by the city of galveston and serviced by certain taxes 
under the agreements  we have the right to one half of the profits of the convention center 
our estimated costs of these projects are included in our projected capital expenditures 
we plan to fund capital expenditures and any additional restaurant acquisitions out of proceeds from existing cash balances  cash flow from operations and availability under our existing credit facility 
as a result of our tax carryforwards and deferred tax assets  including amounts attributable to the acquisition of rainforest cafe  we expect our cash flow from operations to be subject to reduced federal income tax payments for the foreseeable future  and therefore provide additional cash flow for funding our business activities and debt service 
since april we have paid an annual per share dividend  declared and paid in quarterly amounts 
from time to time we review opportunities for restaurant acquisitions  and investments in the hospitality  entertainment  amusement  food service and facilities management and other industries 
our exercise of any such investment opportunity may impact our development plans and capital expenditures 
we believe that adequate sources of capital are available to fund our business activities through december  seasonality and quarterly results our business is seasonal in nature 
our reduced winter volumes cause revenues and  to a greater degree  operating profits to be lower in the first and fourth quarters than in other quarters 
we have and continue to open restaurants in highly seasonal tourist markets 
we further note that the joe s crab shack restaurants tend to experience even greater seasonality and sensitivity to weather than our other restaurant concepts 
periodically  our sales and profitability may be negatively affected by adverse weather  which occurred in the fourth quarter of and is expected to occur in the first quarter of the timing of unit openings can and will affect quarterly results 
critical accounting policies restaurant and other properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
the recoverability of properties that are to be held and used is measured by comparison of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the carrying amount of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
properties to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value  reduced for estimated disposal costs  and are included in other current assets 
the company follows the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  and as such does not record compensation expense related to amounts outstanding 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our operations during the past several years 
we believe we have historically been able to pass on increased costs through menu price increases  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
future increases in restaurant labor costs  including expected future increases in federal minimum wages  land and construction costs could adversely affect our profitability and ability to expand 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates as discussed below 
we actively monitor exposure to market risk and continue to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
interest rate risk total debt at december   included million of floating rate debt attributed to a bank syndicated line of credit at an average interest rate of 
the floating rate debt will mature in july as a result  our annual interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates and may be subject to an increase if we elect to refinance our obligations on a longer term fixed rate basis 
the impact on annual cash flow of a ten percent change in the floating rate approximately would be approximately million annually based on the floating rate debt outstanding at december   however  there are no assurances that possible rate changes would be limited to such amounts 
at december   our floating rate debt had a book value and a fair market value of million
