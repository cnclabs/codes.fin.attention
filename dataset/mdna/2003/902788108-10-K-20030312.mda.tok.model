the company competes with companies many times its size in this line of business 
though the company may not have the scale of its much larger competitors  management believes the company can compete in certain areas due to better attention to customer service and overall flexibility related to services provided

interest accrual is discontinued when  in the opinion of management  the likelihood of collection become doubtful 
annual bankcard fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the period that cardholders may use the card

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management interest rate risk in the banking industry  a major risk exposure is changing interest rates 
to minimize the effect of interest rate changes to net interest income and exposure levels to economic losses  the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management within guidelines established by its asset liability committee alc and approved by the board of directors 
alc has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies  including interest rate exposure 
the company uses the following methods simulation tools for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk market value of equity modeling net portfolio value  net interest income simulation analysis  and  repricing mismatch analysis 
the company does not use hedges or swaps to manage interest rate risk except for the use of future contracts to offset interest rate risk on specific securities held in its trading portfolio 
market value of equity net portfolio value modeling the company uses the market value of equity modeling net portfolio value to measure and manage interest rate sensitivity 
the net portfolio value measures the degree to which the market values of the company s assets and liabilities will change given a change in interest rates 
this model is designed to represent  as of the respective date selected  the increase or decrease in the market value of assets and liabilities that would result from a hypothetical change in interest rates on such date 
the company uses a hypothetical rate change rate shock of basis points and basis points  up or down 
to perform these calculations  the company uses the current loan  investment and deposit portfolios 
the company then makes assumptions regarding new loans and deposits based on historical analysis  management s outlook and repricing strategies 
the company also analyzes loan prepayments and other market risks from industry estimates of prepayment yields and other market changes 
given the low level of current interest rates  the down basis point scenario cannot be completed as of december  table sets forth  for december  and  the increase or decrease as applicable in net portfolio value  that would be caused by the following hypothetical immediate changes in interest rates on such date an immediate increase of basis points  an immediate increase of basis points  and  an immediate decrease of basis points 
table includes both instruments entered into for trading purposes  and the instruments entered into for other than trading purposes  since the former represents such a small portion of the company s portfolio that any difference in the interest rate risk associated with it as compared with the risk associated with instruments entered into for other than trading purposes is immaterial 
the net portfolio value as of december  is higher than december  at both the and basis points increases due to the following reasons total assets  loans  investment securities and deposits were at higher levels at december   there was an additional basis points decline in interest rates in november   the current economy has not improved since  and  the threat of war with iraq has affected the market projection 
for these same reasons  the net portfolio value as of december  is higher than december  at the basis points decrease scenario

table of contents net interest income modeling another tool used to measure interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net interest margin is net interest income simulation analysis 
this analysis incorporates substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment 
through these simulations management estimates the impact on net interest income of a basis point upward or downward gradual change of market interest rates over a one year period 
these simulations include assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to change with changes in loan and deposit growth 
assumptions are made to project rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis  management outlook and repricing strategies 
loan prepayment and other market risks are developed from industry estimates of prepayment spreads and other market change 
since the results of these simulations can be significantly influenced by assumptions utilized  management evaluates the sensitivity of the simulation results to changes in assumptions 
due to the low level of current interest rates the scenarios that simulate a basis point and a basis point decrease cannot be completed as of december  table shows the net interest income increase or decrease over the next twelve months as of december  and both years show that if rates rise or basis points net interest income will increase 
as of december   the table shows that a decrease in rates will mean a decrease in net interest income which actually occurred in 
this is a result of being asset sensitive  meaning assets reprice more quickly than liabilities  giving rise to an improved net interest income in an increasing rate environment  and lower net interest income in a decreasing rate environment 
table market risk in thousands net interest income hypothetical change in interest rate in basis points rate shock december  amount of change december  amount of change static n a n a n a repricing mismatch analysis the company also evaluates its interest rate sensitivity position in an attempt to maintain a balance between the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities which are expected to mature or reprice at any point in time 
while a traditional repricing mismatch analysis gap analysis provides a snapshot of interest rate risk  it does not take into consideration that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics may not in fact reprice at the same time or the same degree 
also  it does not necessarily predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates on net interest income 
management attempts to structure the balance sheet to provide for the repricing of approximately equal amounts of assets and liabilities within specific time intervals 
table is a static gap analysis  which presents the company s assets and liabilities  based on their repricing or maturity characteristics 
this analysis shows that the company is in a positive gap position because assets maturing or repricing exceed liabilities

table of contents other market risk the company does not have commodity price risks or derivative risks 
credit risk management credit risk represents the risk that a customer or counterparty may not perform in accordance with contractual terms 
credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers 
the company utilizes a centralized credit administration function  which provides information on affiliate bank risk levels  delinquencies  an internal ranking system and overall credit exposure 
in addition  loan requests are centrally reviewed to insure the consistent application of the loan policy and standards 
in addition  the company has an internal loan review staff that operates independently of the affiliate banks 
this review team performs periodic examinations of each bank s loans for credit quality  documentation and loan administration 
the respective regulatory authority of each affiliate bank also reviews loan portfolios 
another means of ensuring loan quality is diversification 
by keeping its loan portfolio diversified  the company has avoided problems associated with undue concentrations of loans within particular industries 
commercial real estate loans comprise only of total loans  with no history of significant losses 
the company has no significant exposure to highly leveraged transactions and has no foreign credits in its loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses  all has been discussed prior in this analysis 
also  please see table for a five year analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
the adequacy of the all is reviewed quarterly  considering such items as historical loss trends  a review of individual loans  current economic conditions  loan growth and characteristics  industry or segment concentration and other factors 
a primary indicator of credit quality and risk management is the level of nonperforming loans 
nonperforming loans include both nonaccrual loans and restructured loans 
the company s nonperforming loans increased million at december   compared to a decrease of million a year earlier 
the major portion of nonperforming loans is due to three commercial loan customers 
the company s nonperforming loans have not exceeded of total loans in any of the last five years 
the company had million in other real estate owned as of december   compared to million in the million is primarily associated with one foreclosed credit 
loans past due more than days totaled million at december  compared to million at december  a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when payments are past due days or more and or when management has considerable doubt about the borrower s ability to repay on the terms originally contracted 
the accrual of interest is discontinued and recorded thereafter only when actually received in cash 
certain loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal due to deterioration in the financial condition of the respective borrowers 
in  there was no reduction or deferral of interest due 
the balance of restructured loans has declined to less than million at december

the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a large  stable supply of core deposits and wholesale funds 
ultimately  public confidence is generated through profitable operations  sound credit quality and a strong capital position 
the primary source of liquidity for the company is regularly scheduled payments on and maturity of assets  which include billion of high quality securities available for sale 
the liquidity of the company and its affiliate banks is also enhanced by its activity in the federal funds market and by its core deposits 
neither the company  nor its subsidiaries are active in the debt market 
the traditional funding source for the company s subsidiary banks has been core deposits 
the company has not issued any debt since when million of medium term notes were issued to fund bank acquisitions 
these notes are rated a by moody s investor service and a by standard and poors 
based upon regular contact with investment banking firms  management is confident in its ability to raise debt or equity capital on favorable terms  should the need arise 
the company has contractual obligations that require future cash payments 
the amount of payments required under medium and long term debt obligations and noncancellable property leases in is million 
refer to the financial statements on page for a further discussion on these contractual obligations 
the company also has other commercial commitments that may impact liquidity 
these commitments include unused commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees  and commercial letters of credit 
the total amount of these commercial commitments at december  was billion 
since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon  the total amount of these commercial commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the company 
refer to pages and for a further discussion of these commercial commitments 
the company s cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders  debt service and treasury stock purchases 
management fees and dividends received from subsidiary banks traditionally have been 
table of contents sufficient to satisfy these requirements and are expected to be in the future 
the company s subsidiary banks are subject to various rules regarding payment of dividends to the company 
for the most part  all banks can pay dividends at least equal to their current year s earnings without seeking prior regulatory approval 
from time to time  approvals have been requested to allow a subsidiary bank to pay a dividend in excess of its current earnings 
all such requests have been approved 
operational risk the company is exposed to numerous types of operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees or others  errors relating to transaction processing and systems  and  breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes the potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency  or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards 
included in the legal and regulatory issues with which the company must comply are a number of recently imposed rules resulting from the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of the company operates in many markets and places reliance on the ability of its employees and systems to properly process a high number of transactions 
in the event of a breakdown in the internal control systems  improper operation of systems or improper employee actions  the company could suffer financial loss  face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation 
in order to address this risk  management maintains a system of internal controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution  safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft  and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data 
the company maintains systems of controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about the company s operations 
these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate levels given the company s financial strength  the environment in which it operates  and considering factors such as competition and regulation 
the company has also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct  ethics and business practices are followed on a uniform basis 
in certain cases  the company has experienced losses from operational risk 
such losses have included the effects of operational errors that the company has discovered and included as expense in the statement of income 
while there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer such losses in the future  management continually monitors and improves its internal controls  systems and corporate wide processes and procedures 
furthermore  management believes the plans to streamline the organization through  further systems integration and policies enacted to push down reporting accountabilities further in the organization have improved the company s ability to identify and limit operational risk
