item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies matrix s financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
highlighted below are the accounting policies that management considers significant to the understanding and operations of matrix s business 
revenue recognition matrix records profits on long term contracts on a percentage of completion basis on the cost to cost method 
contracts in process are valued at cost plus accrued profits less billings on uncompleted contracts 
contracts are generally considered substantially complete when field construction is completed 
matrix includes pass through revenue and costs on cost plus contracts  which are customer reimbursable materials  equipment  and subcontractor costs  when matrix determines that it is responsible for the procurement and management of such cost components on behalf of the customer 
matrix has numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion 
such contracts require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition 
at may   a sensitivity analysis of these estimates indicated that a change in total estimated contract revenues would result in a change in gross profits on these jobs 
matrix has a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues  and contracts costs  and accordingly  does not believe these significant fluctuations would ever materialize 
however  current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available 
if estimates of costs to complete long term contracts indicate a loss  provision is made through a contract write down for the total loss anticipated 
the elapsed time from award of a contract to completion of performance may be in excess of one year 
claims recognition claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that a contractor seeks to collect from customers or others for delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other causes of unanticipated additional costs 
matrix records claims in accordance with paragraph of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
this statement of position states that recognition of amounts as additional contract revenue related to claims is appropriate only if it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and if the amount can be reliably estimated 
those two requirements are satisfied by management s determination of the existence of all of the following conditions the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim  additional costs are caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and are not the result of deficiencies in our performance  costs associated with the claim are identifiable or otherwise determinable and are reasonable in view of the work performed  and the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
if such requirements are met  revenue from a claim is recorded to the extent that contract costs relating to the claim have been incurred 
the amounts recorded  if material  are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements 
costs attributable to claims are treated as costs of contract performance as incurred 
insurance reserves matrix maintains insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations 
however  we retain exposure to potential losses through the use of deductibles and self insured retentions 
management regularly reviews estimates of reported and unreported claims and provides for losses through reserves 
adjustments to reserves are recorded as new information regarding claims or potential claims become available 

table of contents goodwill matrix adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective june  under the provisions of the statement  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but will be tested annually for impairment 
the goodwill impairment analysis under sfas no 
requires us to allocate goodwill to our reporting units for the purposes of performing the impairment test 
reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment calculations are one level below or at the company s segment level 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the recorded book value of the reporting unit s net assets including goodwill  then a hypothetical purchase price allocation is performed 
if the amount of goodwill resulting from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment of the goodwill will be recorded 
the fair value of reporting units is based on several factors  including cash flows  earnings multiples  and replacement costs  which involve judgments and assumptions made by management in determining these estimates

table of contents results of operations prior to the acquisition of hake  matrix was organized into three reportable segments aboveground storage tank services  plant services  and construction services 
as a result of the hake acquisition  the structure of the company s internal organization changed in a manner that caused the company s reportable segments to change 
matrix now has two reportable segments construction services and repair maintenance services 
the corresponding items of segment information for earlier periods have been restated 
consolidated overview matrix operates in two segments construction services and repair maintenance services 
all continuing operations are contained within these segments  therefore  significant fluctuations in revenues  gross profits  and operating income will be discussed below by segment 
matrix s revenues fluctuate based on the changing project mix and are dependent on the level and timing of customer releases of new business and on other matters such as project schedules 
consolidated selling  general  and administrative costs as a percent of revenue decreased to compared to for the same period last fiscal year and in fiscal year the reduction in was due to the fixed cost structure at the time being spread over a larger revenue base 
the continued reduction in the current year is entirely the result of leveraging the fixed cost structure with the hake acquisition in the th quarter 
in addition  there were one time charges of approximately million in related to the integration of hake 
restructuring  impairment  and abandonment for fiscal year consists mainly of a one time insurance settlement of million from a recovery under matrix s environmental insurance policy of expenditures made to remediate previously owned properties in newnan  georgia  as well as a million reduction in workers compensation reserves related to exited operations 
interest expense increased to million in from 
million in as a result of increased debt that occurred as a result of the acquisition of hake 
the effective tax rates for the years ended may    and were   and  respectively 
the lower tax rate in was the result of the utilization of tax loss carry forwards from prior years 
the effective tax rate was reduced by post tax equity earnings from a joint venture in the amount of million 
this reduction was offset somewhat by the higher tax rates experienced by the hake group during the th quarter 
construction services vs 
revenues for construction services in were million  an increase of million  or  over the million reported for this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of hake results from the date of its acquisition on march   and significant growth in construction work on the west coast 
new tank construction declined year over year 
gross margins widened to from in fiscal year  owing to higher margin projects and increased volume in our west coast construction group and the absence of two major power projects  which lost money in fiscal the increased revenues and improved gross margins resulted in gross profit for of million  a increase over the million reported for operating income for was million  a improvement over the million for  primarily as the result of the increased revenue and improved gross margins discussed above 
construction services vs 
revenues for construction services in were million  a increase over the revenue amount of million 
this improvement was the result of increased business development efforts towards matrix s core customer base as well as the existence of a positive overall business environment 
gross margins in decreased to from in  primarily as a result of the two projects which lost money in as mentioned above 
one project experienced cost overruns due to underestimated field man hours  while the second project experienced cost overruns due to lower than expected labor productivity 
management has since strengthened policies and procedures to incorporate a more stringent methodology into the estimating process 
the increased revenue volume offset by the gross margin decreases resulted in gross profit for of million  a increase over the million reported for 
table of contents operating income for of million was million more than the million reported for fiscal year  an increase of 
this improvement was due primarily to the higher gross profit discussed above 
repair and maintenance services vs 
revenues for repair and maintenance services in were million  an increase of million  or over the million reported for fiscal year this increase was due to the inclusion of hake revenues for most of the th quarter offset somewhat by the fact that refinery turnaround activity was down year over year 
gross margins declined from in fiscal to in fiscal due to a weak repair and maintenance environment  particularly for refinery turnarounds 
in addition  matrix absorbed 
million of start up costs relative to its new offices in illinois  utah  and south carolina 
the increased revenue volume offset by the decline in gross margins produced gross profit for of million  a decrease from the million reported for operating income for was million  million less than the million reported for this decrease is the result of the reduced gross margins discussed above 
repair and maintenance services vs 
revenues for the repair and maintenance services segment for fiscal year were million or million less than the million reported for fiscal year this decrease was the result of lower routine maintenance activity in gross margins for increased to from in the prior year  primarily as the result of a slightly higher volume of turnaround work 
the reduced revenue along with the improved gross margins resulted in gross profit for of million or million less than the million produced in operating income for was million  which was slightly less than the million reported for  primarily due to the decreased revenue volume discussed above 
exited operations in fiscal  management approved the sale of the assets of our brown subsidiary to caldwell tank  inc caldwell 
the sale was executed in fiscal with matrix retaining temporary ownership of the land and buildings until environmental remediation was completed 
as part of the agreement  caldwell entered into a three year right to lease and an option to acquire the real estate and buildings for million and was obligated to acquire at the same specified price if matrix was able to satisfy specified environmental clean up measures within the three year period

most environmental remediation was completed on the remaining property and caldwell s option to acquire the remaining property was reduced to million 

table of contents fiscal year matrix had no operating activities in brown or san luis during fiscal activity for the year ended may  consisted primarily of million in increased environmental costs related to the remediation at brown  million of increased worker s compensation claims activity of these exited operations and million in warranty work at san luis

at may   the balance on the notional amount stands at million at an interest rate of 
the swap agreement expires in if libor decreases  interest payments received and the market value of the swap position also decrease 
operations of matrix provided million of cash for the twelve months ended may  as compared with providing million of cash for the twelve months ended may   representing an increase of approximately million

table of contents contingency in march  the south coast air quality management district aqmd of the state of california filed a complaint in the los angeles county superior court for the central district against a matrix customer alleging multiple violations by the customer at its west coast refinery for failure to comply with district rules     and of the aqmd that established a self inspection and compliance reporting program for above ground stationary tanks used to store crude oil  gasoline  and other petroleum products 
the aqmd seeks damages of million from the customer  which is a major  multi national producer and refiner of oil and gas and a marketer of petroleum based products throughout the united states and many foreign countries 
of the causes of action made in the complaint  relate to alleged violations of part e of rule for knowingly falsifying inspection reports  failing to conduct self inspection of certain specified tanks  failing to bring non complying tanks into compliance  and failing to comply with the reporting and record keeping requirements of rule e 
matrix is not named in the aqmd complaint  however  counsel for the customer have made a formal demand upon matrix to assume defense of the case and to indemnify them for any damages it may incur 
the customer s demand was made pursuant to the terms of a master services agreement entered into in may between matrix and the customer 
matrix rejected the demands of the customer based upon its own belief as to the proper interpretation of the master services agreement and the facts developed by matrix since the aqmd filed its complaint in march in response to the continued disagreement between the customer and matrix  in june  matrix filed a declaratory judgment action against the customer in the federal district court for the northern district of oklahoma  seeking a declaration by the court that the allegations by the customer against matrix did not constitute a breach of the master services agreement 
apparently  the filing of the declaratory judgment action by matrix reached the highest levels in the customer s organization and resulted in renewed communications between matrix and the customer 
following a meeting between senior management of matrix and the customer  matrix and the customer mutually agreed to toll the dispute for at least four years and until there is a resolution of the complaint filed by the aqmd against the customer  matrix agreed to dismiss without prejudice its pending declaratory judgment action  the customer designated a senior officer that matrix could contact directly if matters seemed to be road blocked again  and the customer renewed a commitment to continue to provide matrix with opportunities for work and new projects 
despite what appears to be a favorable outcome to matrix to date  the significant claim made by the aqmd against the customer remains outstanding 
and while the exiting relationship between matrix and its customer is positive  the possibility of incurring a significant civil penalty may still cause the customer to assert claims against matrix that it believes may be valid under the master services agreement 
matrix is not a party to any litigation regarding this matter and has conducted no discovery to date other than a review of its own records 
there can be no assurance that matrix will not become a party in litigation relating to this matter or what the outcome of any such litigation would be given the inherent uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk matrix s interest rate risk exposure primarily results from its debt portfolio  which is influenced by short term rates  primarily prime rate and libor based borrowings under its credit agreement 
matrix utilizes a million revolving credit facility for which interest rate swaps are not utilized 
therefore  short term interest rate changes could have an impact on future interest expense on amounts outstanding on the credit facility 
at may   million was outstanding on the revolver at interest rates ranging from to 
matrix had borrowed million on the million term loan facility on may  interest on the term loan was based on libor 

table of contents to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  matrix utilizes interest rate swaps to change the ratio of its fixed and variable rate debt portfolio based on management s assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve  and matrix s ability to access the capital markets as necessary 
in fiscal  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement for an initial notional amount of million effectively providing a fixed interest rate of with the company receiving libor 
the swap instrument was designated as a hedge of a million variable interest rate term loan with changes in fair value of the swap recognized in other comprehensive income 
in connection with the financing discussed above  the term loan was paid off  the swap ceased to be a highly effective hedge  and hedge accounting was discontinued prospectively 
as the variable rate term loan was replaced with a variable rate credit facility  the forecasted transactions of variable rate interest payments are still probable of occurring 
as a result  changes in fair value of the swap are recognized in earnings  while the fair value balance at march  of million  net of tax  included in other comprehensive loss  will be amortized to income over the remaining life of the swap to june for the period march  to may   approximately  of accumulated other comprehensive loss was amortized to interest expense 
from the period march  to may   changes in fair value of the swap of approximately  were included in interest expense 
the following table provides information about matrix s term debt and interest rate swap that is subject to interest rate risk 
for term debt  the table presents principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for the interest rate swap  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the interest rate swap

payments included in the table represent the amount the company is obligated to pay in the respective periods 
the acquisition payable is recorded at its present value of  in the financial statements 
accretion is recorded based on a interest rate 
foreign currency risk matrix has a subsidiary company whose operations are located in canada  whose functional currency is the local currency 
historically  results have not been significantly impacted by movements in the foreign currency exchange rate 
however  these investments do have the potential to impact matrix s financial position  due to fluctuations in the local currencies arising from the process of translating the local functional currency into the us dollar 
management has not entered into derivative instruments to hedge the foreign currency risk 
a change in the respective functional currency against the us dollar would not have had a material impact on the financial results of the company for the year ended may
