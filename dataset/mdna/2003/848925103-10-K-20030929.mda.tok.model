such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  the actual plan of operations  business strategies  operating results and financial position of sport haley could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  such forward looking statements 
sport haley s business in general is subject to certain risks including the following the demand for sport haley s products may decrease if the popularity of golf decreases or if other factors  such as a sluggish economy or inclement weather  cause golfers not to patronize golf professional shops 
sport haley must continue to design apparel that is accepted by consumers as fashionable and stylish in order to continue to have market acceptance 
sport haley s sales are seasonal  and historically sales from july through december  sport haley s first and second fiscal quarters  are weaker than sales from january through june  which are sport haley s third and fourth fiscal quarters 
the market for golf apparel is extremely competitive  price competition or industry consolidation could weaken sport haley s competitive position 
sport haley maintains a significant level of finished goods inventories to support its sales volume and its corporate apparel program 
disposal of excess prior seasons inventory at reduced margins is an inherent characteristic within the golf apparel industry  but a significant amount of sales at the lower margins dictated by the liquidation of excess inventories may impair sport haley s financial condition 
write downs with regard to obsolete inventories may also affect its financial condition 
sport haley depends on timely delivery of finished garments from its suppliers 
the loss of certain suppliers  and or delays in receiving garments from suppliers caused by various factors  including labor shortages and transportation difficulties  could adversely affect sport haley s ability to make timely delivery of finished garments to its customers 
sport haley s reliance on foreign suppliers enhances the risk that sport haley s revenues might be adversely affected if a foreign shipment were lost or significantly delayed 
sport haley maintains insurance for risk of loss relating to component inventories shipped between foreign vendors and finished goods inventories shipped from its foreign suppliers to its distribution facilities in denver  colorado 
however  significant reliance on foreign suppliers heightens the risk that sport haley would be left with inadequate or unsatisfactory recourse should the goods received from the foreign suppliers be nonconforming 
sport haley purchases significant amounts of its finished apparel from two separate foreign suppliers and significant amounts of its component inventories from six separate foreign vendors 
if sport haley were to lose or terminate the services of any of these significant suppliers  sport haley s short term ability to fulfill its customers orders on a timely basis could be substantially impaired  thereby negatively affecting sport haley s results of operations 
an ever increasing percentage of sport haley s net sales are derived from licensed sales related to the agreement with top flite golf to market and distribute ben hogan and top flite apparel lines 
an early termination of the agreement with top flite golf could negatively impact sport haley s financial position and results of its operations significantly 
sport haley has been under investigation by the securities and exchange commission the sec  as previously announced 
sport haley has incurred a significant amount of legal and other expenses in responding to the investigation 
on september   the sec commenced an enforcement action  as described above  against sport haley  its chairman and former chief executive officer  robert g 
tomlinson  and its former controller  steve s 
auger 
sport haley will incur additional expenses  including company resources and executive time  in responding to and defending the action  which could negatively impact sport haley s financial position and the results of its operations 
further  sport haley and the named individuals could be subject to certain civil penalties and disgorgement  if the sec action were successful  which could negatively impact sport haley s financial position and the results of its operations 
as previously announced  sport haley and three officers and or directors of the company were named in a putative class action lawsuit related to the restatement of the company s financial statements for the fiscal years ended june  and and certain interim periods in fiscal years  and while management believes that the claims are without merit  sport haley will incur significant expenses  including company resources and executive time  in responding to discovery and otherwise defending the action  which could negatively impact the company s financial position and the results of its operations 
further  if the case were to be certified as a class action and the plaintiffs were to be successful at trial  the amount of any judgment against the company or against the individual defendants  if sport haley were required to indemnify them  could further negatively impact sport haley s financial position and the results of its operations 
the increased threats of terrorist activities in the united states and the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq have likely adversely affected sport haley s sales 
business trends of the golf apparel industry closely follow trends in the travel and leisure sectors of the united states economy 
the recent international conflicts continued to weaken the travel and leisure sectors that had already been negatively impacted by the general economic downturn experienced during the previous years 
sport haley s sales could decrease if the economy further weakens or if the popularity of golf decreases 
sport haley may experience an increase in the number and magnitude of delinquent or uncollectible customer accounts during periods of economic downturn 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
a summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report on k 
the estimates used by management are based upon the company s historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and the results of its operations and require significant or complex judgments on the part of management 
management believes that the following represent the critical accounting policies of the company as described in financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  which was issued by the securities and exchange commission inventory valuation  deferred income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  and  allowance for sales returns 
excess finished goods inventories are a natural component of a seasonal apparel business 
the valuation of inventories involves complex judgments on the part of management 
management continually evaluates and balances the levels of current seasons inventories to meet market demands based upon sales projections  current bookings for future deliveries and at once business 
while certain finished goods items will sell out in any particular selling season  quantities of other finished goods items will remain at the end of each selling season 
sport haley markets previous seasons finished goods inventories at reduced wholesale prices 
however  economic conditions and other factors may depress sales prices for previous seasons finished goods inventories to less than historical costs 
sport haley s management has refined its controls with respect to the amount of finished goods inventories that are anticipated to remain at the end of each selling season 
while management believes that the company s processes produce a fair valuation of inventories  detrimental changes in general economic conditions or in the golf apparel industry could materially affect valuation of the company s inventories 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected tax consequences in future years for differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts  based upon enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
sport haley s significant deferred tax assets are related to net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes  a change in accounting methods for federal income tax purposes  stock options compensation and an unrealized loss for tax purposes on a common stock investment 
state income tax regulations require that sport haley s operating losses be carried forward for state income tax purposes 
sport haley has established a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount expected to be recovered in future periods 
the estimates for deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance require management to exercise complex judgments 
management periodically reviews and adjusts those estimates based upon the most current information available 
however  because the recoverability of deferred tax assets is directly dependent upon future operating results  actual recoverability of deferred tax assets may differ materially from management s estimates 
sport haley s allowance for doubtful accounts reflects a reserve that reduces customer accounts receivable to the net amount estimated to be collectible 
estimating the credit worthiness of customers and the recoverability of customer accounts requires management to exercise considerable judgment 
in estimating the reserve for uncollectible accounts  management considers factors such as general economic and industry specific conditions  historical customer performance and anticipated customer performance 
while management considers the company s processes to be adequate to effectively quantify its exposure to doubtful accounts  changes in economic  industry or specific customer conditions may result in a recoverability of sport haley s doubtful accounts that differs materially from management s estimates 
sport haley records its allowance for sales returns as a net adjustment to customer accounts receivable 
when recording an allowance  the net method reduces customer accounts receivable and net sales by the estimated gross margin effect of the anticipated sales return 
generally  the company s selling terms preclude return of its products subsequent to the sale 
however  the company has traditionally maintained limited programs that offer some customers the right to return certain finished goods items under predefined conditions  and recently an increasing percentage of sport haley s customers refuse receipt of merchandise at the time of delivery 
management reviews historical data and considers factors such as general economic and industry specific conditions and anticipated customer performance when evaluating sport haley s allowance for sales returns 
significant changes in general economic or industry conditions may yield sales returns that differ materially from management s estimates 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by items included in or derived from sport haley s statements of income for its fiscal years ended june   and and as previously restated for its fiscal years ended june  and fiscal year ended june  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of fixed assets income loss from operations other income and expenses  net income loss from operations before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales for fiscal were approximately  an increase of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of ben hogan apparel combined with decreased sales of haley apparel 
the increase in ben hogan apparel sales is indicative of the strong market acceptance of the brand within upscale golf markets 
the increasing percentage of net sales relating to ben hogan apparel is indicative of management s efforts to increase revenues associated with the top flite golf licensing agreement for such apparel 
however  the increasing relative percentage of sales relating to licensed apparel sustains a risk of loss  should the top flite golf licensing agreement be terminated by either party 
the continued decline in haley apparel sales is indicative of the intense competitive environment within golf apparel industry that continued throughout fiscal several companies with significantly greater financial resources and better name recognition than sport haley have continued to influence their customers to maintain strong business relationships with them in these times of a continued weak united states economy 
because of their status  the big name companies have a competitive advantage over sport haley in a sluggish economy  and they have the ability to maintain a greater relative share of the overall golf apparel business in such times 
during fiscal  management implemented marketing strategies to build a unified network of independent sales representatives to thereby strengthen relationships with its loyal haley and ben hogan customers and to attract new customers to the haley and ben hogan brands 
for fiscal  the haley men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
the haley elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
approximately of total net sales was attributable to ben hogan apparel 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering and shipping revenues plus sales at the retail factory outlet store  which sport haley used to sell prior seasons and other inventories at discounted retail prices 
for fiscal  the haley men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
the haley elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
approximately of total net sales was attributable to the introduction of ben hogan apparel 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering and shipping revenues plus sales at retail outlet stores 
gross profit for fiscal was approximately  an increase of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  in fiscal the increase in gross profit was attributable to a combination of factors 
the increased sales of ben hogan apparel contributed significantly to the increase in gross profit achieved in fiscal  because a significant portion of the ben hogan sales were made at full margin 
the increase in gross profit was also attributable to higher margins earned on haley apparel  primarily due to minimizing the margin erosion relating to sales of obsolete and closeout finished goods inventories at reduced selling prices as discussed below 
the higher gross margins on haley apparel were achieved in part because of the improved controls over the purchasing of finished goods inventories that management implemented in fiscal to minimize the level of finished goods inventories remaining at the end of a selling season 
during fiscal  sport haley evolved from a company that manufactured its finished goods inventories into a company that primarily purchases its inventories from foreign suppliers 
gross margin for fiscal was approximately  an increase of approximately  from approximately in fiscal management attributes the increase in gross margin to the increased sales of ben hogan apparel combined with improved margins on the sales of the haley apparel lines 
throughout fiscal  management continued to improve the sourcing for the haley apparel lines in order to achieve higher top line margins 
however  during fiscal  sport haley continued to experience margin erosion with regard to excess and prior seasons component and haley finished goods inventories 
sales of excess and prior seasons inventories at reduced selling prices are common within the golf apparel industry 
because the ben hogan lines were introduced less than two years ago  sales of excess and prior seasons inventories caused minimal erosion of gross margins with respect to ben hogan apparel in fiscal during fiscal and  sales of excess and prior season s inventories  ie sales at or near zero margin  were approximately  and  respectively 
write downs of obsolete inventories to liquidation values are also common within the golf apparel business 
in fiscal  sport haley experienced considerable margin erosion due to writing down component and finished goods inventories to liquidation values 
in fiscal  write downs with respect to obsolete component and finished goods inventories caused much less margin erosion than was caused by the same in fiscal in fiscal  sport haley wrote down obsolete component and finished goods inventories by approximately  as compared with write downs of approximately  in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were approximately  an increase of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal a significant portion of the increase was attributable to operating costs with respect to ben hogan apparel 
selling  general and administrative costs with respect to ben hogan apparel for fiscal were approximately  an increase of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal contributing factors included in the increased ben hogan selling  general and administrative costs were higher amount of royalties paid to top flite golf and commissions paid to independent sales representatives on a corresponding increase in sales of ben hogan apparel  increased advertising expenditures  increased salaries due to expanded customer service operations  and  other increases in general expenses necessary to support the increasing sales 
another contributing factor to the total increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was an increase in bad debt expense 
in fiscal  sport haley recorded bad debt expenses totaling approximately  with respect to three separate customer accounts 
legal defense costs with respect to a securities and exchange commission investigation of and a class action lawsuit filed against sport haley and certain of its officers and directors continued to contribute to increased selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal such legal costs approximated  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
total other income  net  for fiscal approximated  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the difference between the fiscal years in the rates in interest earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the federal reserve bank s actions to strengthen the sluggish usa economy kept interest rates available on virtually risk free investments at or near all time lows during fiscal sport haley continues to search for investment alternatives available within the guidelines approved by its board of directors in order to maximize the rates of return achieved on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
income loss from operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal was approximately  an improvement of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal net loss for fiscal was approximately  an improvement of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal the proportional disparity between the difference in losses from operations before provision for income taxes and the difference in net losses between the fiscal years arose because of the differences in effective tax rates for financial statement  as opposed to tax  purposes 
the effective tax rate in any fiscal year can vary significantly from the effective tax rate in another year due to differences between the methods of recording certain transactions for financial statement versus the methods of recognizing those transactions for tax purposes 
certain deductions recognized for tax purposes may not be recorded for financial purposes in the same fiscal year  and certain expenses recorded for financial statement purposes may not be deductible for tax purposes in the same fiscal year 
the proportional disparity was primarily caused by differences in recording federal net operating loss carry backs in fiscal with regard to the liquidation of the subsidiary 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately as compared with for fiscal comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales for fiscal were approximately  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the general downturn in the united states economy combined with the significant negative economic impact caused by the events of september  business trends of the golf apparel industry closely follow trends in the travel and leisure sectors of the united states economy 
the historic events of september  severely depressed the travel and leisure sectors of the economy that had already been negatively impacted by the general economic downturn experienced during calendar year as a result  sport haley experienced significant cancellations of orders during its second and third fiscal quarters as well as substantial decreases in the number of orders placed for delivery during its third fiscal quarter of fiscal  as compared with the same periods in prior fiscal years 
the cancellations and decreases in orders significantly impacted sport haley s net sales for its third quarter ended march  further  the golf apparel industry sustained an intense competitive environment throughout fiscal companies with greater financial resources and better name recognition than sport haley have continued to pressure their individual customers to maintain strong business relationships with them during times of a relatively weak united states economy 
because of their status  the big name companies have a competitive advantage over sport haley in a sluggish economy  and the big name companies have the ability to maintain a greater relative share of the overall golf apparel business in such times 
sport haley  through its networks of independent sales representatives  implemented marketing strategies to strengthen relationships with its loyal haley customers and to attract new customers to the haley and ben hogan brands

the haley elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
the remaining was comprised of embroidering and shipping revenues plus sales at the laughlin  nevada retail factory outlet store 
gross profit for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  in fiscal while the decrease in gross profit is consistent with the downward trend in net sales  the decrease is not entirely due to such a downward trend 
in an effort to diminish its prior seasons and closeout finished goods inventories  sport haley opened a temporary retail warehouse outlet at its distribution facilities  in the fall of calendar year in its fourth quarter of fiscal  because of the relative success of the fall retail sales effort  sport haley entered into an agreement with a professional liquidator to dispose of prior seasons and closeout inventories at a liquidation retail store operation in denver  colorado 
because the liquidation effort was only marginally successful and excessive amounts of prior seasons and closeout finished goods inventories remained at june   sport haley recorded a charge of approximately  to revalue prior seasons and closeout finished goods inventories to the lower of cost or fair market value 
sport haley also recorded a charge of approximately  to revalue obsolete component inventories to the lower of cost or market value at june  sport haley dramatically altered its business operations during fiscal in order to place the company in a better competitive position within the golf apparel industry 
prior to fiscal  sport haley manufactured substantially all of its finished goods inventories and predominantly utilized united states vendors 
since fiscal  sport haley has primarily purchased its finished goods inventories from offshore suppliers 
gross margin for fiscal was approximately  a decrease of approximately  from approximately in fiscal as discussed above  gross margin was negatively impacted in fiscal due to sales of closeout inventories at reduced selling prices combined with inventory write down adjustments of approximately  that were included in cost of goods sold 
in both fiscal and fiscal  gross margins were negatively impacted by inventory write downs and dispositions of excess and prior seasons inventories at discounted sales prices 
disposition of closeout inventories is common and recurring within the seasonal apparel business in general 
however  dispositions of closeout inventories were disproportionately higher in fiscal and fiscal than normal as a result of the slowing united states economy  adverse weather conditions  changes in sport haley s business operations and other factors 
sales of closeout inventories represented approximately of sport haley s net sales in fiscal and in fiscal and generated approximately  and  in operating cash in fiscal and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were approximately  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal a significant portion of the decrease was attributable to lower commissions paid to independent sales representatives on the corresponding decrease in net sales in fiscal another significant portion of the improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was related to a decrease in accounting  legal and other expenses 
in fiscal  sport haley incurred approximately  in accounting  legal and other expenses related to the restating of sport haley s financial statements for fiscal years and and the correction of material quarterly information for the quarters of fiscal years  and comparatively  sport haley incurred approximately  in such additional legal expenses in fiscal the remainder of the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses directly relates to management s concerted efforts to control operating expenses in fiscal the success of management s efforts to control operating expenses is evidenced by the overall decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses even after sport haley incurred start up and operational costs of approximately  relating to the introduction of ben hogan apparel in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
total other income  net  for fiscal approximated  a decrease of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the difference between fiscal years and in the rates in interest earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
as a function of the dramatically sluggish usa economy  interest rates available on virtually risk free investments plummeted to near all time lows during fiscal sport haley continues to search for investment alternatives available within the guidelines approved by its board of directors in order to maximize the rates of return achieved on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
income loss from operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal was approximately  a difference of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal net loss for fiscal was approximately  a difference of approximately  or  as compared with approximately  for fiscal the proportional disparity between the difference in losses from operations before provision for income taxes and the difference in net losses between the fiscal years arose because of the differences in effective tax rates for financial statement  as opposed to tax  purposes 
the effective tax rate in any fiscal year can vary significantly from the effective tax rate in another year due to differences between the methods of recording certain transactions for financial statement versus the methods of recognizing those transactions for tax purposes 
certain deductions recognized for tax purposes may not be recorded for financial purposes in the same fiscal year  and certain expenses recorded for financial statement purposes may not be deductible for tax purposes in the same fiscal year 
the proportional disparity was primarily caused by differences in recording federal net operating loss carry backs in fiscal with regard to the liquidation of the subsidiary

net cash provided by used in operating activities totaled approximately   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the primary components of adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities were changes between fiscal years relating to impairments and write downs  provisions for doubtful accounts and sales returns  accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes receivable  accounts payable  and accrued commissions and other expenses 
adjustments for impairments and write downs affected net cash provided by used in operating activities by approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal the effects on net cash provided by used in operating activities caused by impairments and write downs represent the expense effects of recording impairments and write downs in the respective fiscal years 
because of the seasonal nature of the apparel business  excess inventories left over at the end of each selling season previous seasons inventories are common within the industry 
throughout each fiscal year  sport haley markets previous seasons inventories through its ordinary marketing channels 
at or near the end of each fiscal year  management identifies and revalues obsolete inventories to estimated liquidation values 
the effects on net cash provided by operating activities caused by changes in provisions for doubtful accounts and sales returns primarily represent the net expense effects of the changes in allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns between the respective years 
provisions for doubtful accounts affected net cash provided by operating activities by approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal in fiscal  the weak usa economy contributed to an increase in delinquent and uncollectible accounts  and sport haley increased its estimated allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly
