critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note a significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition the company is engaged in insurance agency and brokerage activities and derives revenues primarily from commissions on the sale of insurance products to clients that are paid by the insurance underwriters with whom our subsidiary agencies place their clients insurance 
generally  commission income  as well as the related premiums receivable from customers and premiums payable to insurance companies  is recognized as of the effective date of insurance coverage or billing date  whichever is later  net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations 
contingent commissions and miscellaneous commissions are recorded as revenue when received 
service fees are recognized when the services are rendered 
effective january   the company changed its method of accounting for commissions on premiums billed and collected directly by insurance carriers on its middle market property and casualty business 
prior to  this revenue was recognized when received 
beginning january   this revenue is recorded on the later of the billing date or the effective date  consistent with the revenue recognition policy for agency billed business 
commissions on premiums billed and collected directly by insurance carriers on non middle market property and casualty and employee benefits business are recorded as revenue when received 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company monitors its allowance utilizing accounts receivable aging data as the basis to support the estimate 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance may be required 
in addition  the company has the ability to cancel coverage for customers who have not made required payments 
intangible assets the company has acquired significant intangible assets in business acquisitions 
the determination of estimated useful lives and whether the assets are impaired requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 
the company tests goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement in addition  intangible assets subject to amortization are periodically reviewed to determine that no conditions exist indicating a possible impairment 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations statement  and statement statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  under statement  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
in accordance with statement  the company did not record amortization in for goodwill related to acquisitions consummated on or subsequent to july  in addition  the company performed the required goodwill impairment tests in no impairment charge resulted from these tests 
a reconciliation of net income adjusted as if statement had been adopted at january   is presented in note k intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement 
statement requires the company to recognize all derivatives in the balance sheet at fair value 
at adoption  the company had two interest rate swaps  designated as cash flow hedges  used to modify interest characteristics for a portion of its credit facility 
at adoption  the interest rate swaps were recorded at fair value resulting in a cumulative effect accounting change that had no impact on net income and on an after tax basis decreased accumulated other comprehensive income by million 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  effective january   the company changed its method of accounting for cancellation of customer insurance policies to record a reserve for such cancellations 
the cumulative effect of the change on prior years resulted in a charge to income of million net of income taxes of million  for the year ended december  the company periodically reviews the adequacy of the allowance and adjusts it as necessary 
based on the analysis  the allowance as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   the net increase in the cancellation reserve was comprised of million in new reserves related to acquisitions and million from higher revenue levels 
change in accounting principle effective january   the company changed its method of accounting for commissions on premiums billed and collected directly by insurance carriers on its middle market property and casualty business 
prior to  this revenue was recognized when received 
beginning january   this revenue is recorded on the later of the billing date or the effective date  consistent with the revenue recognition policy for agency billed business 
this is the predominant practice followed in the industry 
management believes that this new methodology is preferable and that it better matches the income with the related expenses 
for the year ended december   the effect of this change was to increase net income by million per share  which included the cumulative effect adjustment of million per share  net of income taxes of million 
no prior period pro for ma amounts have been presented to reflect the effect of retroactive application of the change as it is not practical for the company to compute prior period pro forma amounts due to the lack of prior period data
