item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading national provider of medical transcription services 
over of our revenue in was derived from the provision of medical transcription services  which we recognize when we render services 
these services are based primarily on contracted rates 
we also derive revenue from services other than traditional transcription services  such as coding revenue  interfacing fees  equipment rentals and equipment sales 
revenues from these other sources are recognized when earned 
in july we acquired lanier healthcare  llc  which derives revenue largely from the sale and implementation of voice capture and document management solutions  and maintenance service of these products 
in conjunction with this acquisition  we began reporting a separate segment name solutions  which is comprised of the operations of lanier healthcare 
for purposes of our discussion and analysis of our results of operations we distinguish our revenue growth as core growth and growth from large acquisitions 
core growth includes revenue from all of the above sources and revenue from companies acquired which had annual sales under million  prior to the date of acquisition 
revenues arising from acquired companies having annual revenue in excess of million  prior to the date of acquisition  is discussed separately in our analysis of revenue growth 
in we acquired five companies with an aggregate purchase price of million  of which only the acquisition of lanier healthcare llc on july  had a purchase price in excess of million 
in  we acquired seven companies with an aggregate purchase price of million of which five had a purchase price in excess of million 
cost of revenue consists of all direct costs associated with providing sales and services  including payroll  telecommunications  repairs and maintenance  rent and other direct costs 
however  cost of revenue does not include depreciation 
most of our cost of revenue is variable in nature  but includes certain fixed components 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our senior executive management  marketing  accounting  legal and other administrative functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses are mostly fixed in nature  but include certain variable components 
research and development consists of expenses related to the development of new products and services and are mostly fixed in nature 
critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expense  and related disclosures 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
these critical accounting policies and estimate have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from providing medical transcription services  which we recognize when services are rendered 
these services are based primarily on contracted rates 
a portion of our revenue is derived from the sale and implementation of voice capture and document management solutions  and maintenance service of these products 
we recognize revenue and profit on sales and implementation utilizing the percentage of completion method 
with regard to service contracts  which is arranged separate from the product sale  the typical arrangement spans months 
we recognize revenue on the service contracts on a straight line method over the term of the underlying service contract 
deferred revenues represent cash received from customers in advance of revenues being recognized for the related payment 
bad debt we estimate allowances for doubtful accounts receivables based on historical experience and evaluation of the financial condition of the customers 
historically  our estimates have been adequate to cover accounts receivable exposure 
if circumstances related to our estimates change  we may need to record additional allowances 
valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of disposal of long lived assets  we assess long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
we test goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization annually for impairment 
should events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired at some time prior to the annual test  we will test more frequently 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we could not realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation reserve would be reversed

we will continue to monitor this investment on a periodic basis 
in the event the carrying value of the investment exceeds the fair value of the investment and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge will be recorded 
fair value for a life medical  inc is based on estimates and assumptions used in forecasted financial models 
in order to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we evaluate  among other factors the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than carrying value  the financial condition of the company  including key operational and cash flow metrics  current market conditions  future projections and the business outlook for the company  and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value
