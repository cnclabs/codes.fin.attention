the company except where otherwise indicated  the terms moody s and the company refer to moody s corporation and its subsidiaries

the moody s kmv business consists of the combined businesses of kmv llc and kmv corporation kmv  acquired in april  and moody s risk management services 
moody s kmv develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets  credit training services and credit process software 
factors affecting comparability the company operated as part of the dun bradstreet corporation old d b until september  the distribution date  when old d b separated into two publicly traded companies moody s corporation and the new d b corporation new d b 
at that time  old d b distributed to its shareholders shares of new d b stock 
new d b comprised the business of old d b s dun bradstreet operating company the d b business 
the remaining business of old d b consisted solely of the business of providing ratings and related research and credit risk management services the moody s business and was renamed moody s corporation 
the method by which old d b distributed to its shareholders its shares of new d b stock is hereinafter referred to as the distribution 
in general  pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement entered into at the distribution date  all assets and liabilities of the d b business were allocated to new d b and all assets and liabilities of the moody s business were allocated to moody s 
the net indebtedness of old d b at the distribution date was allocated equally between the parties  before giving effect to certain adjustments 
the consolidated financial statements of moody s corporation reflect the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of moody s as if it were a separate entity for all periods presented 
the financial statements include allocations of certain old d b corporate headquarters assets and liabilities that were transferred from old d b at the distribution date  as well as allocations of certain expenses for employee benefits  centralized services and corporate overhead that were provided by old d b for periods prior to the distribution date see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  description of business and basis of presentation  for additional information 
the expense allocations were based on utilization of specific services or  where such an estimate could not be determined  based on moody s revenue in proportion to old d b s total revenue 
although management believes these expense allocations were reasonable  they are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the company had performed or obtained these services as a separate entity 
critical accounting policies and estimates moody s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires moody s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be 
table of contents reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  moody s evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  deferred tax assets  undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries  contingencies  valuation of investments in affiliates  long lived and intangible assets  goodwill  pension and other post retirement benefits and stock based compensation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting policies are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
revenue recognition in recognizing revenue related to ratings  moody s uses judgments to match billed revenue with services to be provided in the future 
these judgments are generally not dependent on the outcome of future uncertainties  but rather relate to allocating revenue across accounting periods 
moody s monitors its ratings on issuers and their outstanding securities 
in cases where the company does not charge ongoing annual fees or other monitoring fees for a particular issuer  the company defers portions of rating fees that will be attributed to future monitoring activities and recognizes such fees over the estimated monitoring periods 
at december  and  deferred revenue included approximately million and million  respectively  related to estimated deferred monitoring fees 
in addition  moody s estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which  in addition to a fixed annual fee  issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding 
related revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding  and is billed subsequently when actual data is available 
at december  and  accounts receivable included approximately million and million  respectively  of accrued commercial paper revenue 
historically  the company has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 
accounts receivable allowance moody s records as reductions of revenue provisions for estimated future adjustments to customer billings  based on historical experience and current conditions 
such provisions are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance 
adjustments to and write offs of accounts receivable are charged against the allowance 
moody s evaluates its estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments to provision rates and the accounts receivable allowance as considered appropriate 
in  the company reduced its provision rates and allowance to reflect its current estimate of the appropriate level of accounts receivable allowance 
deferred tax assets and undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries in assessing the need for deferred tax asset valuation allowances  moody s considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
based on these assessments  moody s has determined that it expects to be able to realize in the future its deferred tax assets  which totaled million at december  however  if moody s profitability or other circumstances were to change adversely  the company could determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future 
in such case  a valuation allowance would be established and an increase in the tax provision would result in the period such determination was made 
in addition  the company has approximately million of undistributed earnings of certain non us subsidiaries  for which no deferred taxes have been provided 
it is currently management s intention to permanently re invest those earnings in the subsidiaries 
if management s approach to re investing those earnings changed or such earnings were distributed to the us  incremental expense of approximately million for us federal and foreign income taxes would be incurred 
contingencies accounting for contingencies  including those matters described in the contingencies section of this management s discussion and analysis  requires the use of judgment and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome 
in many cases  the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties  including governmental or judicial bodies 
the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements  as well as the related disclosures  represent management s best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate 
since the potential exposure on many of these matters is material  and it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the company has reserved  their resolution could have a material effect on moody s future reported results and financial position 
in addition  potential cash outlays related to the resolution of these exposures could be material 

table of contents investments in affiliates  long lived and intangible assets and goodwill moody s assesses the impairment of its investments in affiliates and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these evaluations require the use of judgment as to the effects of external factors and market conditions on the company s conduct of its operations  and they require the use of estimates in projecting future operating results 
if actual external conditions or future operating results differ from the company s judgments  impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of the subject assets 
based on its assessment  in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million pre tax to write down a portion of its equity investment in two argentine rating agencies 
pension and other post retirement benefits moody s employee pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances  including compensation increases  long term return on pension plan assets  health care cost trends  discount rates and other factors 
in determining such assumptions  the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate 
in accordance with relevant accounting standards  if actual results differ from the company s assumptions  such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants 
while the company believes that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expenses and liabilities related to the company s pension and other post retirement benefits 
following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that the company makes in determining costs and obligations for pension and other post retirement benefits 
discount rate assumptions are based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds 
salary growth assumptions are based on the company s long term actual experience and future outlook 
health care cost trend assumptions are based on historical market data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
long term return on pension plan assets is based on the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan s portfolio which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments  over a long term horizon 
in  for the purpose of determining net periodic pension expense  the company expects to use a return on plan assets assumption of approximately  which reflects return assumptions of approximately for equity investments and approximately for fixed income investments 
the return assumption was reduced from in  principally reflecting lower expected returns on equity investments due to market weakness 
this change in assumption will result in an increase in pension expense of approximately million in stock based compensation in and prior years  the company elected not to recognize in its consolidated financial statements compensation expense related to employee stock options  and instead disclosed the related pro forma net income and earnings per share effects in the notes to its consolidated financial statements 
the stock option values that underlie the disclosures are based on a black scholes option pricing model using assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable 
however  circumstances occurring subsequent to issuance of the options could cause the actual value of the options to differ from these estimates 
on january   the company adopted  on a prospective basis  the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 

therefore  employee stock options granted on and after january  will be expensed by the company over the option vesting period  based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant 
in addition  shares issued to participants in the company s employee stock purchase plan will be expensed by the company based on the discount from the market price received by the participants on the date of issuance 
using what the company believes are reasonable assumptions and the black scholes option pricing model  the estimated impact of this change will be approximately per diluted share in in future years  as this change in accounting becomes fully phased in over the normal option vesting cycle currently four years  the company expects that the earnings per share impact will be greater 
the company has a policy of repurchasing its shares to offset the dilutive impacts of stock option exercises  which will be an important use of its cash flow over time 
during  approximately million was spent on such repurchases after option 
table of contents proceeds and related tax benefits  which was approximately of the company s after tax cash flow before dividends  share repurchases and the kmv acquisition 
the company s spending was approximately million  which was approximately of after tax cash flow before dividends and share repurchases 
operating segments the company has historically operated in one reportable business segment ratings  which accounted for approximately of the company s total revenue 
with the april acquisition of kmv  moody s now operates in two reportable business segments moody s investors service and moody s kmv 
accordingly  in the second quarter of  the company restated its segment information for corresponding prior periods to conform to the current presentation 
in discussing periods prior to  the moody s kmv segment is referred to as moody s risk management services mrms  the predecessor business 
the moody s investors service business consists of four rating groups structured finance  corporate finance  financial institutions and sovereign risk  and public finance that generate revenue principally from the assignment of credit ratings on fixed income instruments in the debt markets  and research  which primarily generates revenue from the sale of investor oriented credit research  principally produced by the rating groups 
given the dominance of moody s investors service to moody s overall results  the company does not separately measure or report corporate expenses  nor are they allocated to the company s business segments 
accordingly  all corporate expenses are included in operating income of the moody s investors service segment and none have been allocated to the moody s kmv segment 
the moody s kmv business consists of kmv  acquired in april  and moody s risk management services 
moody s kmv develops and distributes quantitative credit assessment services for banks and investors in credit sensitive assets  credit training services and credit process software

the revolving credit facility the facility consists of an million year facility that expires in september and an million day facility that expires in september as of december   the company had borrowings outstanding of million under the year facility  bearing interest at approximately per annum  and million under the day facility  bearing interest at approximately per annum 
interest on borrowings under the year facility is payable at rates that are based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a premium that can range from basis points to basis points depending on the company s ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  as defined in the related agreement

the company also pays annual facility fees  regardless of borrowing activity under the facility 
the annual fees for the year facility can range from basis points to basis points depending on the company s ratio of total indebtedness to ebitda  and were basis points at december  the annual fees for the day facility are basis points 
under each facility  the company also pays a utilization fee of basis points on borrowings outstanding when the aggregate amount outstanding under such facility exceeds of the facility 
in april  moody s used the facility to initially fund a portion of the purchase price for the kmv acquisition  amounts outstanding under the facility were repaid in the second quarter of since that time  moody s has borrowed under the facility to fund share repurchases

if an event of default were to occur as defined in the agreements and was not remedied by the company within the stipulated timeframe  an acceleration of the notes and restrictions on the use of the facility could occur 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  moody s did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  moody s is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships 
share repurchases during october  moody s completed the million share repurchase program that had been authorized by the board of directors in october on october   the board of directors authorized an additional million share repurchase program  which moody s expects to complete by mid the program includes both special share repurchases and systematic repurchases of moody s common stock to offset the dilutive effect of share issuance under the company s employee stock plans

table of contents outlook certain of the statements below are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of in addition  any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
see forward looking statements on page and additional factors that may affect future results following this section 
results of operations moody s results in and  including growth in revenue  operating income and earnings per share  have exceeded the company s long term financial targets  which are for low teens percent growth in moody s investors service revenue and operating income  with the impact of share repurchases and a lower effective tax rate resulting in mid teens percent growth in diluted earnings per share 
the company anticipates that in some years its growth will exceed these targets and in other years it will be below these targets 
for the moody s kmv business  the company expects revenue to grow to million by  with an operating margin before amortization expense for acquired software and intangibles of greater than or equal to 
moody s is providing its outlook for at a time of significant global macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty 
the inherent difficulty in predicting changes in the global environment  and the timing of such changes  creates important potential variance in the outlook 
in moody s investors service  moderate growth in global structured finance revenue in is anticipated despite the company s expectation of a significant decline in the us housing sector and residential mortgage refinancings  and lower growth in us consumer spending affecting asset backed issuance 
in global corporate finance  the company expects to see moderate overall revenue growth in despite low business investment and mergers and acquisitions activity in the us in the us public finance sector  issuers will likely continue to rely on public debt to fund their budgets as tax receipts remain weak 
nevertheless  because of an expected decline in refinancing activity  the outlook for public finance revenue is modestly lower in moody s also expects a continuation of the strong growth in the research business 
finally  healthy growth in the moody s kmv business is expected 
moody s expenses for will likely reflect continued investment spending on enhanced ratings practices  technology initiatives  product development and continued hiring to support growth areas of the business 
moody s expects a slight decline in the operating margin in compared to the very high margin level in  before the impact of expensing stock options which is discussed elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis 
overall for  moody s expects that percent revenue growth will be in the mid to high single digits 
with the impact of a lower effective tax rate and share repurchases  the company expects that diluted earnings per share will grow in the low double digits  before the approximate per share impact of expensing compensation related to employee stock plans and the approximate per share gain on the insurance recovery related to the september th tragedy which is discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  subsequent event 
the company s outlook takes into consideration the current regulatory environment both within and outside the united states  including the recently published sec report on rating agencies pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act  which is discussed elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis 
based on management s current assessment  moody s does not believe that regulatory action will have a material effect on the company s outlook 
however  changes in the competitive structure of the ratings industry  possibly resulting from additional recognized rating agencies  could have an effect in the future 
cash flow moody s believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its business requirements for the next twelve months and expects to have positive operating cash flow  as well as after tax free cash flow  for fiscal year the company currently intends to use the majority of such free cash flow to continue its share repurchase program 
the company s approach to returning excess cash to shareholders by means of share repurchase is based on the current relative tax efficiency of capital gains over dividends 
should tax rates change and dividends become relatively more tax efficient  the company would reconsider its dividend and share repurchase policies 
in addition  as described above  the company has borrowed under its bank revolving credit facility during to fund portions of the cash requirements related to the kmv acquisition and share repurchase  and may obtain more permanent financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for share repurchases and other strategic opportunities 

table of contents in addition  the company will from time to time consider cash outlays for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses  products  services and technologies 
the company may also be required to make future cash outlays  including during  to pay to new d b its share of potential liabilities related to the legacy tax and legal contingencies that are discussed in this management s discussion and analysis under contingencies 
these potential cash outlays might affect liquidity requirements and cause the company to pursue additional financing 
there can be no assurance that financing to meet cash requirements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
additional factors that may affect future results the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the company faces 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company s management currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  moody s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and or global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets approximately of moody s revenue in was derived from ratings  a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit sensitive securities in the global capital markets 
moody s enjoyed revenue growth from these sources in that was substantially greater than its historical averages  principally due to very strong growth in global structured finance issuance and strong issuance volumes in certain us sectors driven by the favorable interest rate environment 
the company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets 
therefore  the company s results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance 
unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or impair issuers ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance and other transactions for which moody s provides ratings services 
in addition  increases in interest rates  volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment  significant political or economic events  defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance  the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers  and or the types of credit sensitive products being offered 
a sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse affect on moody s business and financial results 
possible loss of market share through competition the markets for credit ratings  research and credit risk management services are intensely competitive 
moody s competes on the basis of a number of factors  including quality of ratings  client service  research  reputation  price  geographic scope  range of products and technological innovation 
moody s faces increasing competition from s p  fitch  local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers such as am best company in the insurance industry 
since moody s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the us  it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets 
these local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions 
currently  moody s  s p  fitch  and dominion bond rating service  ltd 
dbrs are designated as nrsros by the sec 
in its recently released report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets  the sec has indicated that it is exploring whether i there are viable alternatives to the nrsro concept in commission rules and regulations and ii whether it should permit rating agencies that cover a limited sector of the debt market or confine its activities to a limited geographic area to achieve nrsro recognition 
the recognition of dbrs as a nrsro occurred in february  after the release of the sec s report 
elimination of the nrsro concept or sec recognition of additional nrsros could result in loss of market share for moody s 
introduction of competing products or technologies by other companies the markets for credit ratings  research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive 
the ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share 
competitors may develop quantitative methodologies for assessing credit risk that customers 
table of contents and market participants may deem preferable to or more cost effective than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody s 
increased pricing pressure from competitors and or customers in the credit rating  research and credit risk management markets  competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service 
moody s intends to continue providing the highest quality products and the best service to its customers and the capital markets 
however  if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors  moody s may lose market share 
possible loss of key employees to investment or commercial banks or elsewhere and related compensation cost pressures moody s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled  experienced analysts and other professionals 
competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense  and moody s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives 
investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than moody s 
moody s also may not be able to identify and hire employees outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis 
moody s ability to effectively compete will continue to depend  among other things  on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees 
exposure to litigation related to moody s rating opinions moody s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions 
in addition  as moody s international business expands  these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the us such as the first amendment 
these risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time 
potential emergence of government sponsored credit rating agencies when governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated  establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings  the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be negatively affected 
government mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness 
in these circumstances  issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility  and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating  which may negatively affect the company 
proposed us  foreign  state and local legislation and regulations  including those relating to nationally recognized statistical rating organizations in the us and other countries  the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve 
recently there has been discussion in the us regarding the potential need for greater regulation of credit rating agencies 
in october  the staff of the senate committee on governmental affairs issued a report that recommended changes in sec regulation of rating agencies 
in january  the sec released a report on the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities markets 
the report considers a number of issues that the sec was required to examine under the sarbanes oxley act of and other issues arising from a sec initiated review of credit rating agencies 
in the report  the sec stated that it intends to publish a concept release in early to solicit comments on a number of issues affecting the role and operation of credit rating agencies and thereafter to propose rules in response to those comments 
at present  moody s is unable to assess the nature and effect of any regulatory changes that may result from the sec s ongoing review 
implementation guidelines proposed by the committee of european securities regulators under the european commission s market abuse directive are applicable to many participants in the european capital markets  including credit rating agencies 
depending on the form in which they are ultimately adopted  such implementation guidelines may increase moody s cost of doing business in europe and the legal risk associated with such business 

table of contents multinational operations moody s maintains offices outside the us and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the us operations in several different countries expose moody s to a number of legal  economic and regulatory risks such as changes in legal and regulatory requirements possible nationalization  expropriation  price controls and other restrictive governmental actions restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into us dollars currency fluctuations export and import restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of  among other things  distance  travel  cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables political and economic instability potentially adverse tax consequences although such factors have not historically had a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company  any of these factors could have such an effect in the future 
contingencies from time to time  moody s is involved in legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation that are incidental to the company s business  including claims based on ratings assigned by moody s 
management periodically assesses the company s liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters  based upon the latest information available 
for those matters where the probable amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  the company believes it has recorded appropriate reserves in the consolidated financial statements 
in other instances  because of the uncertainties related to both the probable outcome and amount or range of loss  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of a liability  if any 
as additional information becomes available  the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such liabilities accordingly 
based on its review of the latest information available  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability of the company in connection with pending legal and tax proceedings  claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on moody s financial position  results of operations or cash flows  subject to the contingencies described below 
discussion of contingencies is segregated between those matters that relate to old d b  its predecessors and their affiliated companies legacy contingencies and those that relate to moody s business and operations moody s matters 
legacy contingencies to understand the company s exposure to the potential liabilities described below  it is important to understand the relationship between moody s and new d b  and the relationship among new d b and its predecessors and other parties who  through various corporate reorganizations and related contractual commitments  have assumed varying degrees of responsibility with respect to such matters 
in november  the dun bradstreet corporation through a spin off separated into three separate public companies the dun bradstreet corporation  acnielsen corporation acnielsen and cognizant corporation cognizant the distribution

information resources  inc in  information resources  inc iri filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  naming as defendants the corporation then known as the dun bradstreet corporation  ac nielsen company a subsidiary of acnielsen and ims international  inc a subsidiary of the company then known as cognizant 
at the time of the filing of the complaint  each of the other defendants was a subsidiary of the dun bradstreet corporation 
the complaint alleges various violations of united states antitrust laws  including purported violations of sections and of the sherman act 
the complaint also alleges a claim of tortious interference with a contract and a claim of tortious interference with a prospective business relationship 
these claims relate to the acquisition by defendants of survey research group limited srg 
iri alleges srg violated an alleged agreement with iri when it agreed to be acquired by the defendants and that the defendants induced srg to breach that agreement 
iri s complaint alleges damages in excess of million  which amount iri asked to be trebled under antitrust laws 
iri also seeks punitive damages of an unspecified amount 
discovery in this case is ongoing and no trial date has been set 
in connection with the distribution  cognizant  acnielsen and the dun bradstreet corporation entered into an indemnity and joint defense agreement the indemnity and joint defense agreement pursuant to which they have agreed i to certain arrangements allocating potential liabilities iri liabilities that may arise out of or in connection with the iri action and ii to conduct a joint defense of such action 
in particular  the indemnity and joint defense agreement provides that acnielsen will assume exclusive liability for iri liabilities up to a maximum amount to be calculated at such time as such liabilities  if any  become payable the acn maximum amount  and that the dun bradstreet corporation and cognizant will share liability equally for any amounts in excess of the acn maximum amount 
the acn maximum amount will be determined by an investment banking firm as the maximum amount that acnielsen is able to pay after giving effect to i any plan submitted by such investment bank that is designed to maximize the claims paying ability of acnielsen without impairing the investment banking firm s ability to deliver a viability opinion but which will not require any action requiring shareholder approval  and ii payment of related fees and expenses 
for these purposes  financial viability means the ability of acnielsen  after giving effect to such plan  the payment of related fees and expenses and the payment of the acn maximum amount  to pay its debts as they become due and to finance the current and anticipated operating and capital requirements of its business  as reconstituted by such plan  for two years from the date any such plan is expected to be implemented 
in  acnielsen merged with vnu nv pursuant to the indemnity and joint defense agreement  vnu is to be included with acnielsen for purposes of determining the acn maximum amount  and vnu assumed acnielsen s liabilities under that agreement 
in connection with the distribution  old d b and donnelley entered into an agreement the distribution agreement whereby old d b assumed all potential liabilities of donnelley arising from the iri action and agreed to indemnify donnelley in connection with such potential liabilities 
as a result of their separation and pursuant to the related distribution agreement  ims health and nmr are each jointly and severally liable for all cognizant liabilities under the indemnity and joint defense agreement 
in  nmr was acquired by vnu nv and vnu assumed nmr s liabilities under the indemnity and joint defense agreement 
under the terms of the distribution  new d b undertook to be jointly and severally liable with moody s for old d b s obligations to donnelley under the distribution agreement  including any liabilities arising under the indemnity and joint defense agreement 
however  as between themselves  each of new d b and moody s will be responsible for of any payments to be made with respect to the iri action pursuant to the distribution agreement  including legal fees or expenses related thereto 
management is unable to predict at this time the final outcome of the iri action or whether the resolution of this matter could materially affect moody s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
as such  no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the company 

table of contents legacy tax matters old d b and its predecessors entered into global tax planning initiatives in the normal course of business  including through tax free restructurings of both their foreign and domestic operations 
these initiatives are subject to normal review by tax authorities 
pursuant to a series of agreements  as between themselves  ims health and nmr are jointly and severally liable to pay one half  and new d b and moody s are jointly and severally liable to pay the other half  of any payments for taxes  penalties and accrued interest resulting from unfavorable irs rulings on certain tax matters excluding the matter described below as amortization expense deductions for which new d b and moody s are solely responsible and certain other potential tax liabilities after new d b and or moody s pays the first million  which amount was paid in connection with the matter described below as utilization of capital losses 
in connection with the distribution and pursuant to the terms of the related distribution agreement  new d b and moody s have  between themselves  agreed to each be financially responsible for of any potential liabilities that may arise to the extent such potential liabilities are not directly attributable to their respective business operations 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing  three specific tax matters are discussed below 
royalty expense deductions during the second quarter of  new d b received a notice of proposed adjustment from the irs with respect to a partnership transaction entered into in in this notice  the irs proposed to disallow certain royalty expense deductions claimed by old d b on its  and tax returns 
new d b disagrees with the position taken by the irs in its notice and filed a responsive brief to this effect with the irs 
in addition  the irs recently indicated that it may assess penalties on this matter 
if the irs were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the notice and including penalties  and were to prevail in its position  then new d b would be required to pay the assessment 
if new d b were to challenge the assessment in us district court rather than in us tax court  then a payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge 
should any such payments be made by new d b  then pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement  moody s would have to pay to new d b its share 
the company estimates that its share of the required payment to the irs could be up to approximately million including penalties and interest  and net of tax benefits 
moody s also could be obligated for future interest payments on its share of such liability 
in a related matter  new d b has received a preliminary summary report from the irs stating its intention to ignore the partnership structure that had been established and reallocate to old d b income and expense items that had been claimed on the partnership tax return for if the irs were to issue a formal assessment consistent with the report and were to prevail in this matter  then new d b would be required to pay the assessment 
if new d b were to challenge the assessment in us district court rather than in us tax court  then a payment of the disputed amount would be required in connection with such challenge 
moody s estimates that its share of the exposure to the irs for this matter could be up to approximately million including penalties and interest  and net of tax benefits 
such exposure could be in addition to the amount described in the preceding paragraph 
amortization expense deductions the irs has requested from new d b documentation with respect to a transaction executed in that could result in amortization expense deductions from through it is possible that the irs could ultimately challenge these deductions and that new d b could make payments to the irs related to previously claimed deductions 
in that event  moody s would be required to pay to new d b its share of new d b s payments to the irs 
in addition  should new d b discontinue claiming the amortization deductions on future tax returns  moody s would be required to repay to new d b an amount equal to the discounted value of its share of the related future tax benefits 
new d b had paid the discounted value of future tax benefits from this transaction in cash to moody s at the distribution date 
management estimates that the company s current potential exposure related to this matter is million including penalties and interest  and net of tax benefits 
this exposure could increase by approximately million to million per year  depending on actions that the irs may take with respect to assessments and on whether new d b continues claiming the amortization deductions on its tax returns 
utilization of capital losses the irs has completed its review of the utilization of certain capital losses generated during and on june   the irs  as part of its audit process  issued a formal assessment with respect to the utilization of these capital losses and old d b 
table of contents responded by filing a petition for a refund in the us district court on september   after the payments described below were made 
on may   an amended tax return was filed for the and tax periods  which reflected million of tax and interest due 
old d b paid the irs approximately million of this amount on may   of such payment was allocated to moody s and had previously been accrued by the company 
ims health informed old d b that it paid to the irs approximately million on may  the payments were made to the irs to stop further interest from accruing  and new d b is contesting the irs assessment 
new d b has indicated that it would also contest the assessment of penalties or other amounts  if any  in excess of the amounts paid 
with the possible exception of the matter described in the following sentence  moody s does not anticipate any further income statement charges or cash payments related to irs assessments for this matter 
if the irs were to disallow prior deductions of all transaction costs associated with this matter  moody s estimates that its exposure for its share of the additional taxes  penalties and interest net of tax benefits on this matter would be approximately million 
subsequent to making its may payment to the irs  ims health sought partial reimbursement from nmr under their distribution agreement the ims nmr agreement 
nmr paid ims health less than the amount sought by ims health under the ims nmr agreement and  in  ims health filed an arbitration proceeding against nmr to recover the difference 
ims health sought to include old d b in this arbitration  arguing that if nmr should prevail in its interpretation of the ims nmr agreement  then ims health could seek the same interpretation in an alternative claim against old d b 
neither old d b nor any of its predecessors was a party to the ims nmr agreement 
a decision from the arbitration panel is expected in if nmr should prevail in the arbitration against ims health and  in turn  ims health should prevail against old d b  then the company believes that the additional liability of old d b would be approximately million  net of tax benefits 
under the terms of the distribution  moody s and new d b would each be responsible for one half of such amount  or approximately million 
the company believes that the claim asserted against old d b by ims health is without merit 
as such  no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements 
summary of moody s exposure to three legacy tax matters the company has considered the range and probability of potential outcomes related to the three legacy tax matters discussed above and believes that it has adequate reserves recorded in its consolidated financial statements for its probable exposures in these matters 
however  it is possible that these matters could be resolved in amounts that are greater than the company has reserved  which could result in material charges to moody s future reported results 
in addition  the cash outlays resulting from these matters  which the company currently estimates could be as much as million  could be material and could increase with time as described above 
such amount does not include potential penalties related to the payments made in may concerning utilization of capital losses 
moody s matters l association francaise des porteurs d emprunts russes on june  a summons was served in an action brought by l association francaise des porteurs d emprunts russes afper against moody s france sa a subsidiary of the company and filed in the court of first instance of paris  france 
in this suit  afper  a group of holders of bonds issued by the russian government prior to the bolshevik revolution  makes claims against moody s france sa and standard poor s sa for lack of diligence and prudence in their ratings of russia and russian debt since afper alleges that  by failing to take into account the post revolutionary repudiation of pre revolutionary czarist debt by the soviet government in rating russia and new issues of russian debt beginning in  the rating agencies enabled the russian federation to issue new debt without repaying the old obligations of the czarist government 
alleging joint and several liability  afper seeks damages of euro billion approximately us billion as of december  plus legal costs 
moody s believes the allegations lack legal or factual merit and intends to vigorously contest the action 
as such  no amount in respect of this matter has been accrued in the financial statements of the company
