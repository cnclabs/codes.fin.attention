overview we believe that lynx therapeutics  inc is a leader in the development and application of novel genomics analysis solutions that provide comprehensive and quantitative digital gene expression information important to modern systems biology research in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural industries 
gene expression refers to the number of genes and the extent a cell or tissue expresses those genes  and represents a way to move beyond dna sequence data to understand the function of genes  the proteins that they encode and the role they play in health and disease 
systems biology is an approach in which researchers seek to gain a complete molecular understanding of biological systems in health and disease 
we believe that our massively parallel signature sequencing technology  or mpss  generates a complete  accurate and quantitative analysis of the transcriptome which is the full complement of activated genes  messenger rnas or transcripts in a particular tissue at a particular time to enable systems biology 
transcriptome analysis provides information about all the genes that are expressed in a biological sample 
mpss generates simultaneously  from a million or more megaclone our unique and proprietary cloning procedure micro beads  gene sequence information that uniquely identifies a sample s dna molecules without the need for individual conventional sequencing reactions and produces a comprehensive quantitative profile of gene expression in cells or tissues 
mpss is capable of finding and identifying genes that are expressed at low levels in the cell  beyond the normal sensitivity levels of microarrays which are small glass or silicon wafers with tens of thousands of dna molecules arrayed on the surface for subsequent analysis and are the current leading tool for gene expression analysis on the market 
as a result  lynx believes that mpss provides a highly reproducible  quantitative digital readout for the activity of virtually every gene in a biological sample 
additionally  unlike microarrays  which are limited to the genes represented on them  mpss does not require advance knowledge of genes or sequences and  therefore  has broad potential commercial applicability to humans  animals  plants and other commercially important organisms 
our current business model is primarily focused on providing genomics discovery services using mpss 
our commercialization strategies  tactics and target customers for mpss generally involve expanding our work with scientific thought leaders and genomics researchers and gaining additional customers in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural industries 
additionally  our business development efforts include collaborating with information technology it companies that we believe can help design the software and other tools to understand the large  complex mpss based data sets required to enable systems biology 

table of contents megaclone  our unique and proprietary cloning procedure  is the foundation technology for mpss 
megaclone transforms a biological sample containing millions of dna molecules into one made up of millions of micro beads  which are microscopic beads of latex  each of which carries approximately  copies of one of the dna molecules in the sample 
megasort  the other technology that leverages the power of megaclone and that we have developed and commercially applied  enables researchers to focus on potential target genes by permitting  from a single experiment  the direct physical isolation of nearly all the genes differentially expressed between samples

industry background the publication of the first draft sequence of the human genome was a milestone in the history of genetics and genomics 
however  the remaining challenge for researchers in industry and academia alike is to explore the multitude of genomic variations and to discover  from the analysis of these differences  the functions of genes and their roles in health and disease 
it is this work  post genome sequencing  that is expected to lead to commercial opportunities and ultimately to the discovery of new therapies for unmet medical needs and to provide the basis for the emerging fields of pharmacogenomics which is the identification and assessment of genes that are predictive of the efficacy and or toxicity of drug compounds or that may correlate drug responses to the genotype  or genetic makeup  of an individual  and individualized patient therapy 
many diseases result from a malfunction of the genetically programmed protective response to insults  such as trauma  infection  stress or an inherited mutant gene 
that malfunction may result in inadequate  misguided or exaggerated gene expression  unfolding a complex pathogenic process that may resolve itself  linger chronically or evolve with increasingly destructive effects in a manner quite removed from  and even independent of  the original insult 
by analyzing which genes are expressed in a cell or tissue  the level of expression can illustrate which physiological pathways are active in the cell and to what degree 
by understanding when and where abnormal gene expression occurs and the changes in expression that a drug can cause  the physiological pathways implicated in disease and drug action can be pinpointed 
this knowledge could be used to help discover drug targets  screen drug leads  predict a compound s toxic effects  anticipate pharmacological responses to drug leads and tailor clinical trials to the specific needs of subgroups within a population 
by recognizing gene expression patterns  researchers  and ultimately physicians  may also be able to determine which treatments are likely to be effective for a specific condition and which may be ineffective or harmful 
genomic approaches to therapeutics seek to identify genes connected to the origin of a disease 
searches to identify such genes generally are laborious and involve a very large amount of conventional dna sequencing to identify genes or gene fragments 
this knowledge of genes is only a first step 
while it may pave the way for the development of better diagnostics  it may not necessarily lead to a successful therapy 
for example  while a particular gene  or absence of a gene  may predispose a person to a cancer  an entirely different set of genes is likely to govern the tumor and its metastases 
hence  in addition to understanding the cause of disease  it is important to understand entire networks of genes and their functions in both healthy and diseased states in order to identify the optimal targets for therapy 
one approach to genomics research is based on the study of gene expression and regulation of gene expression in cells in differing states or conditions 
gene expression in a cell consists of transcription  the process that converts the genetic information encoded in the double stranded dna of a gene into mrna  and translation  the process that converts the genetic information encoded in mrna into a specific protein molecule 
at any one time  any particular human cell expresses thousands of genes 
a different number of copies of each mrna type will be present in each biological sample depending upon the particular cell  its function and its environmental conditions at the time 
thus  a cell will contain  at any one time  tens of thousands of different mrnas  in various quantities  for a total on the order of one million or more mrna molecules 
elucidating gene function involves not only determining which genes are expressed in a healthy or diseased tissue  but also requires determining which of the altered gene expressions cause a disease rather than result from the disease 
in general  only the most abundantly expressed genes are currently accessible using conventional methods 
in addition  conventional methods are dependent on separating and cloning double stranded copies of each individual mrna  or cdna  prior to analysis 
thus  by conventional methods  it is impractical to obtain a 
table of contents comprehensive  high resolution analysis of gene expression across one million or more mrna molecules in cells of interest to the researcher 
our solution we believe that mpss generates a complete  accurate and quantitative analysis of the transcriptome to enable systems biology 
transcriptome analysis provides information about all the genes that are expressed in a biological sample 
mpss generates simultaneously  from a million or more megaclone micro beads  gene sequence information that uniquely identifies a sample s dna molecules without the need for individual conventional sequencing reactions and produces a comprehensive quantitative profile of gene expression in cells or tissues 
mpss is capable of finding and identifying genes that are expressed at low levels in the cell  beyond the normal sensitivity levels of microarrays 
as a result  lynx believes that mpss provides a highly reproducible  quantitative digital readout for the activity of virtually every gene in a biological sample 
additionally  unlike microarrays  mpss does not require advance knowledge of genes or sequences and  therefore  has broad potential commercial applicability to humans  animals  plants and other commercially important organisms 
our commercialization strategies  tactics and target customers our commercialization strategies  tactics and target customers for mpss generally involve expanding our work with scientific thought leaders and genomics researchers and gaining additional customers in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural industries 
additionally  our business development efforts include collaborating with it companies that we believe can help design the software and other tools to understand the large  complex mpss based data sets required to enable systems biology 
expanding our genomics discovery services business our current business model is primarily focused on providing mpss genomics discovery services to research institutes we believe that scientific thought leaders in research institutes can provide an immediate  significant and enduring source of revenue  both directly from their institutes and from access to labs doing genomics research in the larger scientific research community 
more broadly  we believe that we will benefit by having mpss data placed in the public domain by these researchers 
the scientific thought leaders should provide public and very visible exposure and validation of mpss through their commentary and publications in scientific journals 
pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural customers are an integral component of our business development focus and commercialization efforts 
with the assumed accessibility to data sets containing gene expression information for cells or tissues for comparative purposes stemming from our work with scientific thought leaders and it companies  we expect that pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies will engage us to produce a comprehensive quantitative profile of gene expression in cells or tissues for their specific interests  such as in diseased  abnormal or induced states or conditions 
in these arrangements  we could provide information content for each company s specific internal programs 
we believe that mpss can become the technology of choice to accelerate drug discovery by identifying and validating drug targets and identifying pathways and mode of action  accelerate drug development through lead which is a representative of a compound series with sufficient potential to progress to a drug development program qualification and optimization which is the synthetic modification of a biologically active compound to fulfill all of the necessary properties required for clinical usefulness by improving the success rate of getting products into clinical testing and to the market by patient group stratification which is the division or arrangement of patients into representative subject populations within the clinical trial and toxicology  and enable discovery of biomarkers which is a biochemical feature that can be used to measure the progress of disease or the effects of treatment for diagnostics and pharmacogenomics 
we believe that most of the important drug targets cannot be reliably monitored by gene expression methods other than mpss 
our business development efforts to collaborate with it companies are founded on the comprehensive  quantitative and digital nature of mpss data 
we envision performing genomics discovery services to provide the mpss data content  while the it companies design the software and other tools to understand the large  complex 
table of contents data sets required to enable systems biology 
the it companies would then market this mpss based data along with their hardware and analysis tools to pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies and research institutes 
the revenue sources from genomics discovery service arrangements may include technology access and services fees from performing mpss analyses and providing mpss data 
additionally  we have provided a license  as amended in december  to takara bio inc formerly takara shuzo co 
ltd 
that provides takara with the right to use our technologies to provide genomics discovery services and to manufacture and sell microarrays containing content identified by our technologies in specific geographic territories 
in december  lynx sold to takara two mpss instruments for takara s use in providing genomics discovery services in their licensed territories 
our technologies and applications massively parallel signature sequencing technology our mpss technology addresses the need to generate sequence information from millions of dna fragments 
at this extremely large scale  our mpss approach eliminates the need for individual sequencing reactions and the physical separation of dna fragments required by conventional sequencing methods 
mpss uses proprietary instruments and reagents developed by lynx 
mpss enables the simultaneous identification of nearly all the dna molecules in a sample 
mpss uses flow cells  which are glass plates that are micromachined  or fabricated  to very precise  small dimensions  to create a grooved chamber for immobilizing microbeads in a planar microarray  which is a two dimensional  dense ordered array of dna samples 
with mpss  one million or more megaclone micro beads are fixed in a single layer array in a flow cell  so solvents and reagents can be washed over the micro beads in each cycle of the process 
our proprietary protocol elicits from the megaclone micro beads sequence dependent fluorescent responses  which are recorded by a charged coupled device  or ccd  camera after each cycle 
the process produces short to base pair signature  or identifying  sequences  without requiring fragment separation and separate sequencing reactions as in conventional dna sequencing approaches 
we have developed proprietary instrumentation and software to automate the delivery of reagents and solutions used in our sequencing process and to compile  from the images obtained at each cycle  the signature sequences that result from each experiment 
we believe mpss has the following advantages over conventional dna sequencing methods it sequences dna molecules on as many as one million or more megaclone beads simultaneously  it eliminates the need for individual sequencing reactions and gels  it identifies each of the dna molecules by a unique to base signature sequence  it produces a comprehensive quantitative profile of gene expression in cells or tissues of interest  and it identifies even the rarest expressed genes 
we currently have over operational proprietary mpss instruments 
megasort technology our megasort technology provides a method to identify and physically extract essentially all genes that differ in expression levels between two samples 
the novelty of megasort is that the identification and extraction are performed in a single assay 
megasort compares two dna samples  each containing millions of molecules  and extracts those dna molecules that are present in different proportions in the samples 
these extracted dna molecules could be differentially expressed genes or dna fragments that are found in one sample but not in the other 
because the comparison and sorting process requires no prior knowledge of the sequences of the genes present in either sample  megasort can be used with samples isolated from tissues or organisms that are not well characterized 
megasort involves hybridizing which is a molecular technique that uses one nucleic acid strand to locate another two probes prepared separately  one from each of the samples to be compared  with a population of megaclone micro beads  each of which carries many copies of a single dna fragment or gene derived from either of the samples 
because each probe is labeled with a different fluorescent marker  we can readily separate by a fluorescence activated cell 
table of contents sorter  also referred to as a facs  genes or fragments that are under or over represented in either sample 
genes or fragments of interest can then be recovered from the sorted micro beads for further study 
megaclone technology megaclone  our unique and proprietary cloning procedure  forms the foundation of our technologies 
megaclone transforms a biological sample containing millions of dna molecules into one made up of millions of micro beads  which are microscopic beads of latex  each of which carries approximately  copies of one of the dna molecules in the sample 
in contrast to conventional cloning  in which an individual dna molecule is selected from a sample and amplified into many copies for analysis or identification  we can capture on one set of micro beads clones of nearly all the dna sequences that characterize a sample 
once attached to the micro beads  these clones can be handled and subjected to experiments and analyses all at the same time 
megaclone thereby enables many analyses or characterizations to be conducted that would otherwise be too cumbersome or onerous to conduct using conventional procedures where each clone must be addressed individually 
megaclone is a process that uses a proprietary library of approximately million short synthetic dna sequences  called tags  and their complementary anti tags  to uniquely mark and process each dna molecule in a sample 
each unique tag is a permanent identifier of the dna molecule it is attached to  and all of the tagged molecules in a sample are amplified together to create multiple copies of the tagged molecules 
we use another proprietary process to generate five micron diameter micro beads  each of which carries multiple copies of a short anti tag dna sequence complementary to one of the million tags 
then  we collect the amplified tagged dna molecules onto the micro beads through hybridization of the tags to the complementary anti tags 
each micro bead carries on its surface enough complementary anti tags to collect approximately  identical copies of the corresponding tagged dna molecule 
by this process  each tagged dna molecule in the original sample is converted into a micro bead carrying about  copies of the same sequence 
therefore  in a few steps  our megaclone technology can transform a complex mixture of a million or more individual dna molecules into a usable format that provides the following benefits substantially all the different dna molecules present in a sample typically one million or more are represented in the final micro bead collection  these million or more dna molecules can be analyzed simultaneously in various applications  and the need for storing and handling millions of individual dna clones is eliminated 
megaclone is the foundation for our analytical applications  principally mpss and megasort 
collaborations  customers and licensees we have derived substantially all of our revenues from corporate collaborations  customer agreements and licensing arrangements

axaron bioscience ag  formerly basf lynx bioscience ag in  lynx and basf established axaron bioscience ag  a joint venture company in heidelberg  germany 
axaron began operations in and is employing our technologies in its neuroscience  toxicology and microbiology research programs 
upon the establishment of axaron  we contributed access to our technologies to axaron in exchange for an initial equity ownership 
basf  by committing to provide research funding to axaron of dm million or approximately million based on a december exchange rate over a five year period beginning in  received an initial equity ownership in axaron 
in  basf agreed to provide an additional million in research funding to axaron  of which million was paid to us for technology assets related to a central nervous system program 
in june  we extended our technology licensing agreement with axaron 
the license extends axaron s right to use our proprietary mpss and megasort technologies nonexclusively in axaron s neuroscience  toxicology and microbiology programs until december  the agreement also positions axaron to apply our technologies to specific disorders in the neuroscience field 
under the terms of the agreement  we received a million technology license fee from axaron 
we intend to furnish to axaron  initially without charge and later for a fee  megaclone technology micro beads  other reagents and additional mpss instruments for use in axaron s research programs 
in  lynx and basf agreed to continue their support of axaron s growth  including an increase in the capital of axaron 
we made an additional investment of million in axaron  which maintained our ownership interest in axaron at approximately 
given our ownership share of axaron and our ability to exercise significant influence over axaron s operating and accounting policies  we have accounted for the investment under the equity method in accordance with accounting principles board no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
through december   we have received aggregate payments of million from axaron under all related agreements 
we recorded revenue of million in and million in from axaron  as the technology license fee from axaron is being recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the noncancelable term of the technology licensing agreement 
we did not recognize any revenue from axaron in we may receive additional payments from axaron over the remaining term of the technology licensing agreement from the sale to axaron of proprietary reagents and additional mpss instruments for use in axaron s research programs 
competition competition among entities attempting to identify the genes associated with specific diseases and to develop products based on such discoveries is intense 
we face  and will continue to face  competition from pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies  such as affymetrix  inc  celera genomics group  incyte genomics  inc  gene logic  inc  genome therapeutics corporation and hyseq  inc  academic and research institutions and government agencies  both in the united states and abroad 
several entities are attempting to identify and patent randomly sequenced genes and gene fragments  while others are pursuing a gene identification  characterization and product development strategy based on positional cloning 
we are aware that certain entities are using a variety of gene expression analysis methodologies  including chip based systems  to attempt to identify disease related genes 
in addition  numerous pharmaceutical companies are developing genomic research programs  either alone or in partnership with our competitors 
competition among such entities is intense and is expected to increase 
in order to successfully compete against existing and future technologies  we will need to demonstrate to potential customers that our technologies and capabilities are superior to those of our competitors 
many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs  facilities  manufacturing and marketing experience  distribution channels and human resources than we do 
these competitors may discover  characterize or develop important genes  drug targets or drug leads  drug discovery technologies or drugs in advance of our customers or us or that are more effective than those developed by our collaborators and customers or us 
they may also obtain regulatory approvals for their drugs more rapidly than our collaborators or 
table of contents customers will  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
moreover  our competitors may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that could limit our rights or our collaborators and customers abilities to use our technologies or commercialize therapeutic  diagnostic or agricultural products 
we also face competition from these and other entities in gaining access to cells  tissues and nucleic acid samples for use in our discovery programs 
intellectual property we are pursuing a strategy designed to obtain united states and foreign patent protection for our core technologies 
our long term commercial success will be dependent in part on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims and to protect our intellectual property portfolio 
as of december   we owned or controlled issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states and foreign countries relating to our genomics and proteomics technologies 
in addition to acquiring patent protection for our core analysis technologies  as part of our business strategy  we may file for patent protection on sets of genes  both known and newly discovered  that have diagnostic or prognostic applications  novel genes that may serve as drug development targets  genetic maps and sets of genetic markers  such as snps  that are associated with traits or conditions of medical or economic importance 
however  there is substantial uncertainty regarding the availability of such patent protection 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology field in which we operate is still evolving 
the degree to which we will be able to protect our technology with patents  therefore  is uncertain 
others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies  duplicate any of our technologies and  if patents are licensed or issued to us  design around the patented technologies licensed to or developed by us 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend ourselves in patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate such suits 
with respect to proprietary know how that is not patentable and for processes for which patents are difficult to enforce  we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests 
we intend to maintain several important aspects of our technology platform as trade secrets 
while we require all employees  consultants  collaborators  customers and licensees to enter into confidentiality agreements  we cannot be certain that proprietary information will not be disclosed or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information 
research and development expenditures we have devoted our efforts primarily to research and development 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  scientific advisor sydney brenner  mb  d

employees as of december   we employed full time employees  of which were engaged in production and research and development activities 
in january  we announced a reduction of approximately of our workforce  or people 
the groups affected primarily by this action included research and development personnel based at lynx gmbh in germany  and those working in our proteomics group in california 

table of contents the workforce reduction was intended to further focus our financial and human resources on expanding the commercial use of mpss 
we believe we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel  however  competition for such personnel is intense 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  and management considers relations with our employees to be good

business risks our business faces significant risks 
these risks include those described below and may include additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we currently do not believe are material 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
we have a history of net losses 
we expect to continue to incur net losses  and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have incurred net losses each year since our inception in  including net losses of approximately million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
net losses may continue for at least the next several years 
the presence and size of these potential net losses will depend  in part  on the rate of growth  if any  in our revenues and on the level of our expenses 
our research and development expenditures and general and administrative costs have exceeded our revenues to date 
research and development expenses may increase due to spending for ongoing technology development and implementation  as well as new applications 
we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability 
even if we do increase our revenues and achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain profitability 
our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability depends on many factors  including our ability to continue existing customer relationships and enter into additional corporate collaborations and agreements  our ability to expand the scope of our products and services into new areas of pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural research  our customers and collaborators abilities to develop diagnostic  therapeutic and other commercial products from the application of our technologies  and the successful clinical testing  regulatory approval and commercialization of such products by our customers and collaborators 
the time required to reach profitability is highly uncertain 
we may not achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all 

table of contents we will need additional funds in the future  which may not be available to us 
we have invested significant capital in our scientific and business development activities 
our future capital requirements will be substantial as we conduct our operations  and will depend on many factors including the progress and scope of our research and development projects  payments received under our customer  license and collaborative agreements  our ability to establish and maintain customer  license and collaborative arrangements  the progress of the development and commercialization efforts under our customer  license and collaborative agreements  the costs associated with obtaining access to samples and related information  and the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and funding anticipated to be received from customers  collaborators and licensees will enable us to maintain our operations through at least december  changes to our current operating plan may require us to consume available capital resources significantly sooner than we expect 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
we do not know if we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
if we fail to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may have to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds  if such funds are at all available  by entering into financing or collaborative agreements on unattractive terms  or we will not be able to fund our operations 
our technologies are new and unproven and may not allow our customers  collaborators or us to identify genes  proteins or targets for drug discovery 
you must evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities affecting an early stage genomics company 
our technologies are new and unproven 
the application of these technologies is in too early a stage to determine whether it can be successfully implemented 
these technologies assume that information about gene expression and gene sequences may enable scientists to better understand complex biological processes 
our technologies also depend on the successful integration of independent technologies  each of which has its own development risks 
relatively few therapeutic products based on gene discoveries have been successfully developed and commercialized 
our technologies may not enable our customers  collaborators or us to identify genes  proteins or targets for drug discovery 
to date  neither our customers nor we have identified any targets for drug discovery based on our technologies 
we are dependent on our customers and collaborators and will need to find additional customers and collaborators in the future to develop and commercialize diagnostic or therapeutic products 
our strategy for the development and commercialization of our technologies and potential products includes entering into collaborations  customer agreements or licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies and research institutes 
we do not have the resources to develop or commercialize diagnostic or therapeutic products on our own 
if we cannot negotiate additional collaborative arrangements or contracts on acceptable terms  or at all  or such collaborations or relationships are not successful  we may never become profitable 
we have derived substantially all of our revenues from corporate collaborations  customer agreements and licensing arrangements 
revenues from such agreements depend upon continuation of the related relationships  our performance of genomics discovery services  the achievement of milestones and royalties derived from future products developed from our research and technologies 
to date  we have received a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of collaborators  customers and licensees 
for the year ended december   revenues from dupont  takara  geron corporation  bayer cropscience and basf accounted for    and  respectively  of our total revenues 
for the year ended december   revenues from dupont  basf  takara and the institute of molecular and cell biology accounted for   and  respectively  of our total revenues 
for the year ended december   revenues from dupont  basf and bayer cropscience accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
if we fail to perform genomics 
table of contents discovery services or successfully achieve milestones or our collaborators fail to develop successful products  we will not earn the revenues contemplated under such agreements 
if our collaborators  customers or licensees do not renew existing agreements  we lose one of these collaborators  customers or licensees  we do not attract new collaborators  customers or licensees or we are unable to enter into new collaborative  customer or license agreements on commercially acceptable terms  our revenues may decrease  and our activities may fail to lead to commercialized products 
our dependence on collaborations with third parties subjects us to a number of risks 
we have limited or no control over the resources that our collaborators may choose to devote to our joint efforts 
our collaborators may breach or terminate their agreements with us or fail to perform their obligations thereunder 
further  our collaborators may elect not to develop products arising out of our collaborative arrangements or may fail to devote sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  marketing or sale of such products 
while we do not currently compete directly with any of our customers and collaborators  some of our customers and collaborators could become our competitors in the future if they internally develop dna analysis technologies or if they acquire other genomics companies and move into the genomics industry 
we will not earn the revenues contemplated under our customer and collaborative arrangements  if our customers and collaborators do not develop commercially successful products using our technologies  develop competing products  preclude us from entering into collaborations with their competitors  fail to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  or terminate their agreements with us 
we depend on a single supplier to manufacture flow cells used in our mpss technology 
flow cells are glass plates that are micromachined  or fabricated to very precise  small dimensions  to create a grooved chamber for immobilizing micro beads in a planar microarray  which is a two dimensional  dense ordered array of dna samples 
we use flow cells in our mpss technology 
we currently purchase the flow cells used in our mpss technology from a single supplier  although the flow cells are potentially available from multiple suppliers 
while we believe that alternative suppliers for flow cells exist  identifying and qualifying new suppliers could be an expensive and time consuming process 
our reliance on outside vendors involves several risks  including the inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components due to manufacturing capacity constraints  a discontinuance of a product by a third party manufacturer or other supply constraints  reduced control over quality and pricing of components  and delays and long lead times in receiving materials from vendors 
we operate in an intensely competitive industry with rapidly evolving technologies  and our competitors may develop products and technologies that make ours obsolete 
the biotechnology industry is highly fragmented and is characterized by rapid technological change 
in particular  the area of genomics research is a rapidly evolving field 
competition among entities attempting to identify genes and proteins associated with specific diseases and to develop products based on such discoveries is intense 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial  scientific and marketing resources than we do 
we face  and will continue to face  competition from pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies  as well as academic research institutions  clinical reference laboratories and government agencies 
some of our competitors  such as affymetrix  inc  celera genomics group  incyte genomics  inc  gene logic  inc  genome therapeutics corporation and hyseq  inc  may be attempting to identify and patent randomly sequenced genes and gene fragments and proteins  pursuing a gene identification  characterization and product development strategy based on positional cloning  which uses disease inheritance patterns to isolate the genes that are linked to the transmission of disease from one generation to the next  and 
table of contents using a variety of different gene and protein expression analysis methodologies  including the use of chip based systems  to attempt to identify disease related genes and proteins 
in addition  numerous pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies are developing genomics and proteomics research programs  either alone or in partnership with our competitors 
our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances 
rapid technological development by others may make our technologies and future products obsolete 
any products developed through our technologies will compete in highly competitive markets 
our competitors may be more effective at using their technologies to develop commercial products 
further  our competitors may obtain intellectual property rights that would limit the use of our technologies or the commercialization of diagnostic or therapeutic products using our technologies 
as a result  our competitors products or technologies may render our technologies and products  and those of our collaborators  obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary technologies  third parties may be able to use our technologies  which could prevent us from competing in the market 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of the intellectual property related to our technologies and products 
the patent positions of biotechnology companies  including our patent position  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us  and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending their proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions 
we have applied and will continue to apply for patents covering our technologies  processes and products as and when we deem appropriate 
however  third parties may challenge these applications  or these applications may fail to result in issued patents 
our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patents 
in addition  our patents may be challenged or invalidated or fail to provide us with any competitive advantage 
we also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we protect our proprietary information and processes  in part  with confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators and consultants 
however  third parties may breach these agreements  we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or our trade secrets may still otherwise become known by our competitors 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information 
litigation or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend substantial time and money and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies and products 
our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties and not breaching any licenses that we have entered into with regard to our technologies 
other parties have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications covering genes  gene fragments  proteins  the analysis of gene expression and protein expression and the manufacture and use of dna chips or microarrays  which are tiny glass or silicon wafers on which tens of thousands of dna molecules can be arrayed on the surface for subsequent analysis 
we intend to continue to apply for patent protection for methods relating to gene expression and protein expression and for the individual disease genes and proteins and drug discovery targets we discover 
if patents covering technologies required by our operations are issued to others  we may have to rely on licenses from third parties  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
third parties may accuse us of employing their proprietary technology without authorization 
in addition  third parties may obtain patents that relate to our technologies and claim that use of such technologies infringes these patents 
regardless of their merit  such claims could require us to incur substantial costs  including the diversion of management and technical personnel  in defending ourselves against any such claims or enforcing our patents 
in the event that a successful claim of infringement is brought against us  we may need to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost  or at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies and products and thus prevent us from achieving profitability 

table of contents we have limited experience in sales and marketing and thus may be unable to further commercialize our technologies and products 
our ability to achieve profitability depends on attracting collaborators and customers for our technologies and products 
there are a limited number of pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies and research institutes that are potential collaborators and customers for our technologies and products 
to market our technologies and products  we must develop a sales and marketing group with the appropriate technical expertise 
we may not successfully build such a sales force 
if our sales and marketing efforts fail to be successful  our technologies and products may fail to gain market acceptance 
our sales cycle is lengthy  and we may spend considerable resources on unsuccessful sales efforts or may not be able to enter into agreements on the schedule we anticipate 
our ability to obtain collaborators and customers for our technologies and products depends in significant part upon the perception that our technologies and products can help accelerate their drug discovery and genomics efforts 
our sales cycle is typically lengthy because we need to educate our potential collaborators and customers and sell the benefits of our products to a variety of constituencies within such companies 
in addition  we may be required to negotiate agreements containing terms unique to each collaborator or customer 
we may expend substantial funds and management effort without any assurance that we will successfully sell our technologies and products 
actual and proposed consolidations of pharmaceutical companies have negatively affected  and may in the future negatively affect  the timing and progress of our sales efforts 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel could impair the growth of our business 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff 
the loss of any of these persons services might adversely impact the achievement of our objectives and the continuation of existing customer  collaborative and license agreements 
in addition  recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform future research and development work will be critical to our success 
there is currently a shortage of skilled executives and employees with technical expertise  and this shortage is likely to continue 
as a result  competition for skilled personnel is intense and turnover rates are high 
competition for experienced scientists from numerous companies  academic and other research institutions may limit our ability to attract and retain such personnel 
we depend on our president and chief executive officer  kevin p 
corcoran  the loss of whose services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
although we have an employment agreement with mr 
corcoran in place  currently we do not maintain key person insurance for him or any other key personnel 
we use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials 
our operations produce hazardous waste products 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
we may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials  and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development and production efforts 
ethical  legal and social issues may limit the public acceptance of  and demand for  our technologies and products 
our collaborators and customers may seek to develop diagnostic products based on genes or proteins 
the prospect of broadly available gene based diagnostic tests raises ethical  legal and social issues regarding the appropriate use of gene based diagnostic testing and the resulting confidential information 
it is possible that discrimination by third party payors  based on the results of such testing  could lead to the increase of premiums by such payors to prohibitive levels  outright cancellation of insurance or unwillingness to provide coverage to individuals showing unfavorable gene or protein expression profiles 
similarly  employers could discriminate against employees with gene or protein expression profiles indicative of the potential for high disease related costs and lost employment time 
finally  government authorities could  for social or other purposes  limit or prohibit the 
table of contents use of such tests under certain circumstances 
these ethical  legal and social concerns about genetic testing and target identification may delay or prevent market acceptance of our technologies and products 
although our technology does not depend on genetic engineering  genetic engineering plays a prominent role in our approach to product development 
the subject of genetically modified food has received negative publicity  which has aroused public debate 
adverse publicity has resulted in greater regulation internationally and trade restrictions on imports of genetically altered agricultural products 
claims that genetically engineered products are unsafe for consumption or pose a danger to the environment may influence public attitudes and prevent genetically engineered products from gaining public acceptance 
the commercial success of our future products may depend  in part  on public acceptance of the use of genetically engineered products  including drugs and plant and animal products 
if we develop products with our collaborators  and if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources 
we may be held liable  if any product we develop with our collaborators causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable during product testing  manufacturing  marketing or sale 
although we have general liability and product liability insurance  this insurance may become prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect us against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit our ability to commercialize products developed with our collaborators 
healthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit our returns on diagnostic or therapeutic products that we may develop with our collaborators 
if we successfully validate targets for drug discovery  products that we develop with our collaborators based on those targets may include diagnostic or therapeutic products 
the ability of our collaborators to commercialize such products may depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of these products will be available from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
in the us  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services 
the trend towards managed healthcare in the us  legislative healthcare reforms and the growth of organizations such as health maintenance organizations that may control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare products and services  may result in lower prices for any products our collaborators may develop 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products 
if adequate third party coverage is not available in the future  our collaborators may fail to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on their investment in research and product development 
our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones  and the occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment  which could require us to cease or curtail operations 
our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes 
we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters  including fire  floods  power loss  communications failures and similar events 
if any disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business at our facilities would be seriously  or potentially completely  impaired 
in addition  the unique nature of our research activities could cause significant delays in our programs and make it difficult for us to recover from a disaster 
the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 
accordingly  an earthquake or other disaster could materially and adversely harm our ability to conduct business 
our stock price may be extremely volatile 
we believe that the market price of our common stock will remain highly volatile and may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors 
the market prices for securities of many publicly held  early stage biotechnology companies have in the past been  and can in the future be expected to be  especially volatile 
for example  during the two year period from january  to december   the closing sales price of our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq national market fluctuated from a low of to a high of per share 
in addition  the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the following factors and events may have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock fluctuations in our operating results  
table of contents announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  release of reports by securities analysts  developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights  developments in our relationships with current or future collaborators  customers or licensees  and general market conditions 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
these factors may cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
if we are unable to maintain our nasdaq national market listing  the liquidity of our common stock would be seriously impaired and we would become subject to various statutory requirements  which would likely harm our business 
on september   we received a letter from nasdaq advising us that our common stock had not met nasdaq s minimum closing bid price requirement for consecutive trading days and that  if we were unable to demonstrate compliance with this requirement during the calendar day grace period ending december   our common stock may be subject to delisting from the nasdaq national market 
we failed to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement during the day grace period  and subsequently received a delisting letter from nasdaq on december  on december   we requested an oral hearing before a nasdaq listing qualifications panel to appeal our potential delisting 
at the oral hearing on january   we informed nasdaq that we believed we had regained compliance with the nasdaq national market continued listing requirements following a for reverse split of our common stock effected on january  on february   we received a letter from nasdaq advising us that the nasdaq listing qualifications panel acknowledged that we had regained compliance with the requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
the nasdaq listing qualifications panel determined to continue the listing of our securities on the nasdaq national market provided that we file our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  with the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq evidencing shareholders equity of at least  and that we demonstrate compliance with all requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq national market at that time 
at december   we had total stockholders equity of  the nasdaq listing qualifications panel reserves the right to modify or terminate this decision upon a review of our reported financial results 
in the event that we fail to comply with any terms of this decision  our securities may be transferred to the nasdaq smallcap market  provided we are able to demonstrate compliance with all applicable maintenance criteria and an ability to sustain long term compliance 
in the event we are unable to do so  our securities will be delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
transferring to the nasdaq smallcap market would make us subject to certain adverse consequences as described below 
in addition  we would still be required to satisfy various listing maintenance standards for our common stock to be quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market  including the minimum bid price requirement 
if we fail to meet such standards  our common stock would likely be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market and trade on the over the counter bulletin board  commonly referred to as the pink sheets 
such alternatives are generally considered less efficient markets and would seriously impair the liquidity of our common stock and limit our potential to raise future capital through the sale of our common stock  which could materially harm our business 
if we are delisted from the nasdaq national market  we will face a variety of legal and other consequences that would likely negatively affect our business including  without limitation  the following we may lose our exemption from the provisions of section of the california corporations code  which imposes aspects of california corporate law on certain non california corporations operating within california 
as a result  i our stockholders would be entitled to cumulative voting and ii we would be subject to more stringent stockholder approval requirements and more stockholder favorable dissenters rights in connection with certain strategic transactions  the state securities law exemptions available to us would be more limited  and  as a result  future issuances of our securities may require time consuming and costly registration statements and qualifications  
table of contents due to the application of different securities law exemptions and provisions  we may be required to amend our stock option and stock purchase plans and comply with time consuming and costly administrative procedures  the coverage of lynx by securities analysts may decrease or cease entirely  and we may lose current or potential investors 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law may make it more difficult to acquire us or to effect a change in our management  even though an acquisition or management change may be beneficial to our stockholders 
under our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the holders of our common stock  to issue  additional shares of preferred stock from time to time in series and with preferences and rights as it may designate 
these preferences and rights may be superior to those of the holders of our common stock 
for example  the holders of preferred stock may be given a preference in payment upon our liquidation or for the payment or accumulation of dividends before any distributions are made to the holders of common stock 
any authorization or issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with financings  possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock or making it more difficult to remove directors and effect a change in management 
the preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights senior to those of our common stock  and  as a result  an issuance of additional preferred stock could lower the market value of our common stock 
provisions of delaware law may also discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
item properties in february  we entered into a noncancelable operating lease for facilities space of approximately  square feet in two buildings in hayward  california 
currently  our corporate headquarters  principal research and development facilities and production facilities are located in one of the two buildings 
the remaining space will be developed and occupied in phases  depending on our growth 
the lease runs through december we have an option to extend the lease for an additional five year period  subject to certain conditions 
we have leased approximately  square feet of additional space in one of the buildings for further expansion purposes 
in june  lynx gmbh entered into a noncancelable operating lease for facilities space of approximately  square feet in heidelberg  germany  to house its operations 
the lease terminates in june axaron is currently subleasing a portion of this space 
with the workforce reduction at lynx gmbh in january  we are evaluating alternative uses for the facilities space  which include subleasing all or a significant portion of the vacant space to a new tenant or terminating the lease 
in the event of lease termination  we will be obliged to make the monthly lease payments on the facilities space for up to six months if the space remains without a new lessee and to pay the remaining unamortized balance of tenant improvements financed by the landlord over the term of the lease 
additionally  we may be required to pay up to euro  or approximately  based on a december  exchange rate for the costs necessary to alter the facilities space to permit or enable another party to lease such space 
if we choose to terminate the lease  we estimate that the total payments  including possible alteration costs  will be approximately in august  we entered into a noncancelable operating lease  which expires on july   for another facility 
in  we entered into an agreement to sublease a portion of this space  and in  through a subsequent agreement  subleased the remaining portion of the facility 
the term of the sublease runs through july rent from the sublease is sufficient to cover the rent and other operating expenses incurred by lynx under the terms of the lease

overview we believe that lynx therapeutics  inc is a leader in the development and application of novel genomics analysis solutions that provide comprehensive and quantitative digital gene expression information important to modern systems biology research in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural industries 
these solutions are based on megaclone and massively parallel signature sequencing  or mpss  lynx s unique and proprietary cloning and sequencing technologies 
gene expression refers to the number of genes and the extent a cell or tissue expresses those genes  and represents a way to move beyond dna sequence data to understand the function of genes  the proteins that they encode and the role they play in health and disease 
systems biology is an approach in which researchers seek to gain a complete molecular understanding of biological systems in health and disease 
we have incurred net losses each year since our inception in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
net losses may continue for at least the next several years 
the size of these losses will depend on the rate of growth  if any  in our revenues and on the level of our expenses 
to date  we have received  and expect to continue to receive in the future  a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of collaborators  customers and licensees 
for the year ended december   revenues from dupont  takara  geron corporation  bayer cropscience and basf accounted for    and  respectively  of our total revenues 
for the year ended december   revenues from dupont  basf  takara and the institute of molecular and cell biology accounted for   and  respectively  of our total revenues 
for the year ended december   revenues from dupont  basf and bayer cropscience accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
revenues in each quarterly and annual period have in the past  and could in the future  fluctuate due to the timing and amount of any technology access fees and the period over which the revenue is recognized  the level of service fees  which is tied to the number and timing of biological samples received from our collaborators and customers  as well as our performance of the related genomics discovery services on the samples  the timing of achievement of milestones and the amount of related payments to us  and the number  type and timing of new  and the termination of existing  agreements with collaborators  customers and licensees 
our operating costs and expenses include cost of service fees  research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses 
cost of services fees includes the costs of direct labor  materials and supplies  outside expenses  equipment and overhead incurred by us in performing our genomics discovery services for our collaborators  customers and licensees 
research and development expenses include the costs of personnel  materials and supplies  outside expenses  equipment and overhead incurred by us in our technology and application development and process improvement efforts 
research and development expenses may increase due to spending for ongoing technology development and implementation  as well as new applications  primarily for mpss 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of personnel  materials and supplies  outside expenses  equipment and overhead incurred by us primarily in our administrative  business development  legal and investor relations activities 
general and administrative expenses may increase in support of our research and development  commercial and business development efforts 
we account for our investment in axaron bioscience ag  a company owned primarily by basf ag and us  using the equity method 
prior to our cash capital contribution of approximately million in  such investment had a carrying value of zero in the financial statements 
since september   we have recognized our share of axaron s operating results in the accompanying statements of operations 
for the year ended december   our pro rata share of axaron s losses was approximately million 
as of december   we employed full time employees  of which were engaged in production and research and development activities 
in january  we announced a reduction of approximately of our total 
table of contents workforce  or people 
the groups affected primarily by this action included research and development personnel based at lynx gmbh in germany and our proteomics group in california 
the workforce reduction was intended to further focus our financial and human resources on expanding the commercial use of mpss 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments include determining the useful lives of fixed assets for depreciation and amortization calculations  assumptions for valuing options and warrants and estimated lives of license and collaborative agreements related to deferred revenue 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
revenue recognition technology access fees have generally resulted from upfront payments from collaborators  customers and licensees who are provided access to lynx s technologies for specified periods 
we receive service fees from collaborators and customers for genomics discovery services performed by us on the biological samples they send to lynx 
collaborative research revenues are payments received under various agreements and include such items as milestone payments 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue pursuant to collaborative agreements upon the achievement of specified technology developments  representing the culmination of the earnings process 
other revenues include the proceeds from the sale of technology assets  the sale of proprietary instruments and reagents  and grant revenue 
technology access and license fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the noncancelable term of the agreement to which they relate 
payments for services and or materials provided by lynx are recognized as revenues when earned over the period in which the services are performed and or materials are delivered  provided that no other obligations  refunds or credits to be applied to future work exist 
revenues from the sale of technology assets are recognized upon the transfer of the assets to the purchaser 
revenues from the sales of instruments and reagents are recognized upon shipment to the customer 
investments in equity securities as of december   we held an approximate equity interest in axaron bioscience ag 
we account for our equity investment in axaron using the equity method because our ownership is greater than and we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating  investing and financing decisions of axaron 
under the equity method  we record our pro rata share of axaron s income or losses and adjust the basis of our investment accordingly 
although we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of axaron  we may choose not to exercise such influence or may not have influence over certain operating matters 
consequently  axaron s operating results could differ significantly from our expectations and our pro rata share of axaron s income or losses that we record in the future could be material 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues we had total revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  revenues for included technology access fees and service fees of million  license fees of million from axaron  a related party  and million of collaborative research and other revenue  primarily from the sale of certain of lynx s technology assets to geron corporation and the sale of mpss instruments to takara 
revenues for included technology access fees and service fees of million  license fees of million from axaron  a related party  and million of collaborative research and other revenue 
our revenues have historically fluctuated from quarter to quarter and year to year and may continue to fluctuate in future periods due primarily to our service fees  which are impacted principally by the timing and number of biological samples received from existing customers and collaborators  as well as our performance of 
table of contents related services on these samples 
additionally  the number  type and timing of new collaborations and agreements and the related demand for  and delivery of  our services or products will impact the level of future revenues 
operating costs and expenses our total operating costs and expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  cost of services fees and other were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and reflect the costs of providing our genomics discovery services and the cost of the mpss instruments sold to takara 
research and development expenses were million in and million in the decrease in research and development expenses in reflects a decrease in materials consumed in research and development efforts and lower personnel expenses  primarily resulting from the workforce reduction that occurred in the second quarter of our efforts in were directed primarily toward the expansion of the commercial applications of  and process improvements for  our genomics technologies and the continued development of our proteomics technology 
research and development expenses may increase due to planned spending for ongoing technology development and implementation  as well as new applications  primarily for mpss 
lynx s research and development expenses of million for were comprised of million in research expenses related primarily to internal discovery projects and million in development expenses  including million for the megatype technology and million for the protein profiler technology 
in april  we discontinued our development effort on megatype  a technology that was being developed to permit the comparison of collected genomes of two populations and enable the detection and recovery of dna fragments with the single nucleotide polymorphisms  or snps  that distinguish these two populations 
snps are single nucleotide variations  or differences occurring in a single subunit of dna or rna  in the genetic code that occur on average at every  bases along the three billion nucleotides in the human genome 
in january  we discontinued our development work on our proteomics technology  protein profiler  which was intended to provide high resolution analysis of complex mixtures of proteins from cells or tissues 
proteomics is the study of the number of proteins and the extent to which they are expressed in cells or tissues 
the primary reason for discontinuing our development efforts on both megatype and protein profiler was to focus our financial and human resources on expanding the commercial use of mpss  which we believe will have the greatest commercial value to us 
we anticipate that our research and development efforts in the future will be directed primarily toward the expansion of the commercial applications of  and process improvements for  our genomics technologies  principally mpss 
these technologies assume that information about gene expression and gene sequences may enable scientists to better understand complex biological processes 
our technologies also depend on the successful integration of independent technologies  each of which has its own development risks 
relatively few therapeutic products based on gene discoveries have been successfully developed or commercialized 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of these technologies or the ultimate costs of such efforts 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses from the period to the period reflects lower personnel expenses and lower outside service costs 
the restructuring charge of million in the year ended december   was comprised primarily of severance charges for former lynx employees who were part of lynx s workforce reduction of approximately of our domestic workforce  or people  in the second quarter of the group affected primarily by this action was research and development personnel in california 
the workforce reduction was intended to focus our financial and human resources on expanding the commercial use of mpss 
in terms of compensation  benefits and employer taxes that would have been paid to  and on behalf of  such former employees had they remained employed by lynx  we anticipate annualized cost savings of approximately million 
general and administrative expenses may increase in support of our research and development  commercial and business development efforts 
interest and other income net interest expense was million in the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the net interest expense reflects primarily increased expense incurred on equipment related debt outstanding in and a decrease in interest income due to the decline in interest rates during as compared to the period 
other income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the other income was related primarily to the 
table of contents gain on the sale of our equity investment in inex pharmaceuticals corporation 
in  other income was due primarily to a gain of million from the receipt of shares of common stock from inex  as part of the proceeds related to the march sale of our former antisense program  and a realized gain of million from the sale of previously held inex shares  partially offset by an other than temporary write down in the value of previously held inex shares of million 
equity share of loss of related party the equity share of loss of related party of million for the year ended december  reflects lynx s pro rata share of the net loss of axaron  a joint venture investee  for the same period 
lynx s pro rata share of axaron s losses was immaterial for income taxes income tax benefit was  in the year ended december   compared to the provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december  the income tax benefit related primarily to a refund received for federal alternative minimum taxes paid in prior periods  offset by foreign withholding tax due on payments received from our licensee  takara 
the income tax provision consisted entirely of foreign withholding tax on a payment received from our licensee  takara 
as of december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which will expire at various dates from through  if not utilized 
we had a state net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  which will expire in the years through as of december   we also had federal and california research and development and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research and development credit will expire at various dates from through  if not utilized 
utilization of our net operating loss may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization 
subsequent events in january  we announced a reduction of approximately of our workforce  or people 
the groups affected primarily by this action include research and development personnel based at lynx therapeutics gmbh in germany and in our proteomics group in california 
the workforce reduction is intended to further focus our financial and human resources on expanding the commercial use of mpss 
we estimate the portion of the charge related to severance payments to our former employees to be approximately million and will be recorded in the first quarter of in terms of compensation  benefits and employer taxes that would have been paid to  and on behalf of  such former employees had they remained employed by lynx  we anticipate annualized cost savings of approximately million 
years ended december  and revenues we had total revenues of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues from to was due primarily to higher service fees from the greater number of biological samples received from and analyzed for our customers and collaborators  including from new service agreements entered into or activated during revenues for included technology access fees and service fees of million  license fees of million from axaron  a related party  and million of collaborative research and other revenue

net cash provided by financing activities in of million was due primarily to the issuance of lynx common stock in two private placements 
net cash provided by financing activities in of million was due primarily to the issuance of lynx common stock from the exercise of employee stock options 
in both september and december  in connection with our collaboration agreement with takara  we issued and sold  shares of common stock  at a purchase price of per share  to takara in private placements pursuant to the terms and conditions of common stock purchase agreements 
in april  we completed a private placement of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
the financing included the sale of million newly issued shares of common stock  at a purchase price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million  pursuant to a common stock purchase agreement between lynx and certain investors 
in connection with this transaction  lynx issued warrants to purchase up to million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share

in connection with this transaction  we issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in october  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution  comerica bank california  for an equipment line of credit of up to million with a draw down period of one year 
under the initial advance  we drew down million in november related to the purchase of equipment made in previous periods 
lynx granted comerica bank california a security interest in all items lynx financed under this agreement 
the initial advance under the loan to finance the purchase of equipment made in previous periods has a term of months from the date of advance and bears interest at a rate of 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we are required to maintain a minimum cash balance of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in an account at comerica bank california of at least million until comerica bank california receives payment in full of all outstanding obligations  and there is a liquidity requirement that we have a balance of unrestricted cash at each month s end that is greater than our net decrease in cash during the preceding four months 
as of december   the principal balance under loans outstanding under this agreement was million 
we believe that we are in compliance with all terms of the agreement 
in late  we entered into a financing agreement with a financial institution  transamerica business credit corporation  under which we drew down million during for the purchase of equipment and certain other capital expenditures 
we granted the lender a security interest in all items financed by it under this agreement 
each draw down under the loan has a term of months from the date of the draw down 
as of december   the principal balance under loans outstanding under this agreement was million 
the draw down period under the agreement expired on march  our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows principal payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years after years total in thousands operating leases equipment loans total contractual cash obligations this table does not include any payment obligations under license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 

table of contents we plan to use available funds for ongoing commercial and research and development activities  working capital and other general corporate purposes and capital expenditures 
we expect capital investments during will be less than million and will be comprised primarily of equipment purchases required in the normal course of business 
we intend to invest our excess cash in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
we have obtained funding for our operations primarily through sales of preferred and common stock  payments under contractual arrangements with customers  collaborators and licensees and interest income 
consequently  investors in our equity securities and our customers  collaborators and licensees are significant sources of liquidity for us 
therefore  our ability to maintain liquidity is dependent upon a number of uncertain factors  including but not limited to the following our ability to advance and commercialize further our technologies  our ability to generate revenues through expanding existing collaborations  customer and licensee arrangements and obtaining significant new customers  collaborators and licensees  and the receptivity of capital markets toward our equity or debt securities 
the cost  timing and amount of funds required for specific uses by us cannot be precisely determined at this time and will be based upon the progress and the scope of our commercial and research and development activities  payments received under customer  collaborative and license agreements  our ability to establish and maintain customer  collaborative and license agreements  costs of protecting intellectual property rights  legal and administrative costs  additional facilities capacity needs  and the availability of alternate methods of financing 
we have experienced operating losses since our inception of million  including a net loss of million for the year ended december  net losses may continue as lynx proceeds with the commercialization and additional development of our technologies 
our cash and cash equivalents were million at december  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and funding anticipated to be received from customers  collaborators and licensees will enable us to maintain our operations through at least december  changes to our current operating plan may require us to consume available capital resources significantly sooner than we expect 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
we may seek additional financing  as needed  through arrangements with customers  collaborators and licensees and equity or debt offerings 
we do not know if we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
if we are unable to secure additional financing on reasonable terms  or are unable to generate sufficient new sources of revenue through arrangements with customers  collaborators and licensees  management may be forced to take substantial restructuring actions  which may include significantly reducing lynx s anticipated level of expenditures  the sale of some or all of our assets  or obtaining funds by entering into financing or collaborative agreements on unattractive terms  or we will not be able to fund operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investments the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while  at the same time  maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of less than one year 
as a result  we do not believe we are subject to significant interest rate risk 
foreign currency rate fluctuations the functional currency for our german subsidiary is the euro 
our german subsidiary s accounts are translated from the euro to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period  for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  and to date  have not been material 
our german subsidiary conducts its business primarily in euros 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our german subsidiary or transactions with our european collaborators and customers
