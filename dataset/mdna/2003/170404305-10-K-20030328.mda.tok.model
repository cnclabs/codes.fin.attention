our actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including but not limited to  those discussed in item of this annual report under the caption risk factors and those discussed elsewhere in this annual report and in our other sec filings 
chordiant undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events after the date of this report

we believe that we are leaders in providing business process driven solutions for customer management 
our software architecture is based on the jee java enterprise edition industry standard that is widely supported by vendors and widely adopted by business customers in the industries we serve 
we believe that solutions based on other architectures are less capable of meeting the current and future requirements of global consumer companies 
our target customers include companies with demanding customer relationships involving a large number of individual customers with complex customer relationships requiring high levels of personalized services 
we began marketing our enterprise solutions in through our acquisitions of prime response  inc prime response  ondemand  and of certain technology from actionpoint  inc actionpoint  and asp outfitter  inc 
asp outfitter  we have added new products to our product offerings 
our customers include global companies in the financial services  telecommunications  retail and travel services industries 
our solutions seek to fulfill the requirements these companies have for enterprise wide customer system software infrastructure solutions capable of servicing millions of individual customers across multiple communication channels in real time 
our solutions enable organizations to market  sell and serve their customers across multiple channels  including call centers  branch representatives and self serve channels such as automated telephony  the internet and e mail 
we have had several acquisitions over the past two years 
as a result of these acquisitions  comparison of prior period revenues and expenses may not be meaningful 

table of contents service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that service revenues will continue to represent over of our total revenues 
we sell our products through our direct sales force  and we augment our sales efforts through relationships with systems integrators  application service providers and technology vendors 
for the years ended december   and  revenues were derived from customer accounts in the americas  europe principally the united kingdom and elsewhere in the world 
for the years ended december   and  international revenues were million  million and million  respectively  or approximately  and of our total revenues  respectively 
we believe international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods 
a small number of customers account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
as a result  the loss or delay of individual orders or delays in the product implementations for a customer can have a material impact on our revenues 
we expect that revenues from a small number of customers will continue to account for a majority of our total revenues in the future as historical implementations are completed and replaced with new projects from new and existing customers 
customer concentration has reduced and we expect that trend to continue 
pricing pressure during the past year has intensified particularly with application products 
several of our competitors continue to aggressively price their products with large discounts in comparison to our prices 
over the past year  we have continued to see competitive pricing pressure 
our strategy is to continue to offer products with functionality different and superior to our competitors 
our international revenue growth rate has continued to outpace our united states revenue growth rate 
we feel this has occurred for the following reasons 
first  the us economy has been weak compared to areas where we have an international presence 
second  our leadership and market presence has been very strong internationally  particularly in the united kingdom 
the following table summarizes the revenues from customers in excess of of total revenues years ended december  usaa hutchinson g lloyds tsb eds direct line the royal bank of scotland since our inception  we have incurred substantial research and development costs and have invested heavily in the expansion of our product development  sales  marketing and professional services organizations to build an infrastructure to support our long term growth strategy 
the number of our fulltime employees decreased to at december  from at december   representing a decrease of approximately 
the decrease was due to reductions in force that occurred during fiscal year we anticipate that our operating expenses will decrease during in absolute figures when compared to fiscal we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
our prospects must be considered given the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving businesses 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
in addition  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to estimates of percentage of completion on our service contracts  uncollectible receivables  investment values  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  including estimating the total estimated days to complete sales arrangements involving significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our product  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts  and assessment of the probability of the outcome of our current litigation  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  restructuring costs  and determining functional currencies for the purposes of consolidating our international operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from licenses of our software and related services  which include assistance in implementation  customization and integration  post contract customer support  training and consulting 
in addition to determining our results of operations for a given period  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as sales commissions and royalties 
revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex and certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
the amount and timing of our revenue is difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in operating losses 
at the time of entering into a transaction  we assess whether any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our product so that the software performs as the customer requests 
for contracts involving significant implementation or customization of the software  we recognize the license and service fees using the percentage of completion method using labor hours incurred as the measure of progress towards completion 
approximately  and of total revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting during  and  respectively 
the progress toward completion is measured based on the go live date 
we define the go live date as the date on which the essential functionality has been delivered or on which the application enters into a production environment or the point at which no additional chordiant supplied professional services resources are required 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of time to reach the go live date can be made 
estimates are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
we account for the change in estimate in the period the change has been identified 
provisions for estimated contract losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
when we sell additional licenses related to the original licensing agreement  revenue is recognized either upon delivery if the project has reached the go live date  or if the project has not reached the go live date  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
we classify revenues from these arrangements as license and service revenues based upon the estimated fair value of each element 

table of contents on contracts not involving significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products  we recognize license revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  there is probability of collection and delivery has occurred 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenues for the delivered elements based upon the residual contract value as prescribed by statement of position no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
this means that we defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for our perpetual licenses are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon optional substantive renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
fair value of services is based upon separate sales by us of these services to customers 
in situations in which we are not responsible for implementation services but are obligated to provide unspecified additional software products in the future  we recognize revenue as a subscription ratably over the term of the commitment period 
for all sales we use either a binding purchase order or signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our third party systems integrators are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
revenues from reseller arrangements are recognized on the sell through method  when the reseller reports to us the sale of our software products to end users 
our agreements with customers and resellers do not contain product return rights 
we recognize revenue for post contract customer support ratably over the support period  generally one year 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly or daily rates  and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
we bill customers according to contract terms 
we record as deferred revenues amounts due by customers in excess of revenues recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts and accruals for litigation 
we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
generally  we require no collateral from our customers 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
our current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded at least the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  when there is a range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
furthermore  we assess the impairment of goodwill annually 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  market capitalization relative to net book value  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
when one or more of the above indicators of impairment occurs we estimate the value of long lived assets and intangible assets to determine whether there is an impairment 
we measure any impairment based on projected discounted cash flow method  which requires us to make several estimates including the estimated cash flows associated with the asset  the period over which these cash flows will be generated and a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
these estimates are subjective and if we made different estimates  it could materially impact the estimated fair value of these assets and the conclusions we reached regarding an impairment 
to date  we have not identified any triggering events  which would require us to perform this analysis 
we are required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance on at least an annual basis 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we compare the fair value of out reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill  of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we proceed on to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to our identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess 

table of contents we determined that we have one reporting unit 
we performed step of the goodwill impairment analysis required by sfas as of january  and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
accordingly  step was not performed 
as required  we completed our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
we will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount 
restructuring costs 
during fiscal and  we implemented cost reduction plans as part of our continued effort to streamline our operations to reduce ongoing operating expenses 
these plans resulted in restructuring charges related to  among others  the consolidation of excess facilities 
these charges relate to facilities and portions of facilities we no longer utilize and either seek to terminate early or sublease 
lease termination costs for the abandoned facilities were estimated for the remaining lease obligations and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees and sublease rates which can be achieved using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage retained by us 
each reporting period we review these estimates and to the extent that these assumptions change due to continued negotiations with landlords or changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary by material amounts 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation 
we have several foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately of our revenues  of our assets and of our total liabilities as of december  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance are either included within the statement of operations or as a separate part of our net equity under the caption cumulative translation adjustment 
under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in cumulative translation adjustments 
however  if the functional currency were deemed to be the united states dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized into our statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the relevant subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
accordingly  we had cumulative translation gains of approximately million and cumulative translation losses of approximately million  which were included as part of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within our balance sheet at december  and  respectively 

table of contents the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar 
these currencies include the united kingdom pound sterling  the euro and australian and canadian dollars 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these years 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations

requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including discontinued operations and that they be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas no 
also broadens the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity that has operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
the adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas no

is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting and records compensation expense for all stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
finally  this statement amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial statements 
the amendment of the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the amendment of the disclosure requirements of apb opinion no 
is effective for financial reports containing condensed consolidated financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  since we have not elected to change to the fair value based method of accounting and therefore do not record compensation expense for most stock based employee compensation  the transition provisions of sfas no 
had no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we expect to adopt this statement effective january  and do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with operating lease agreements 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of fin on our financial position and results of operation 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires us to consolidate a variable interest entity if we are subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
we do not currently have any variable interest entities and  accordingly  we do not expect our adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and revenues license 
total license revenues decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  license revenues for enterprise solutions decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  license revenues for application products decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  the overall license revenue decrease was primarily due to the decline in the number of application product implementations by new customers 
service 
total service revenues  which include reimbursement of out of pocket expenses  increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  service revenues for enterprise solutions increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million  or less than  for the year ended december  service revenues for application products increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  the overall service revenue increase was primarily due to a continuation in large customer implementations as well as maintenance  support and consulting revenues associated with license agreements 
reimbursement of out of pocket expenses which is included in total service revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  license gross margins were approximately for both years ended december  and  respectively 
the cost of license revenues is in line with the decrease of our license revenue 
we expect cost of license revenues to remain in the four to six percent range of license revenues 
service 
cost of service revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  these costs resulted in service gross margins of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
service gross margins improved mainly as the result of combined effects of restructuring actions implemented  increased efficiencies and reduced spending 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  the decrease in these expenses were mainly attributable to a decrease of million in personnel related expenses due to a decrease in headcount and commission expenses  a decrease of million in marketing programs and professional services  a decrease of million of non cash compensation expense and a million decrease in facilities and overhead expenses 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million  or approximately  for the year ended december  the decrease was mainly due to a decrease of million of purchased in process research and development expenses and million in outside consulting expense 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of 
table of contents million in personnel related expenses  million in non cash compensation expense and million in allocated depreciation and overhead costs 
purchased in process research and development 
in process research and development expense represents acquired technology that  on the date of acquisition  had not achieved technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use  based on the state of development 
because the product under development may not achieve commercial viability  the amount of acquired in process research and development was immediately expensed 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased in process research and development into a commercially viable product principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its designed specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
during  we expensed million related to acquired in process technology attributable to the acquisition of ondemand 
during  we expensed a total of million related to acquired in process technology of which million is attributable to the acquisition of prime response  million is attributable to the acquisition of certain assets of actionpoint  million is attributable to certain assets acquired from asp outfitter and million is attributable to certain assets acquired from pyxis  inc the value of the purchased in process research and development was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to the product  determined based upon our estimates of costs to complete the development of the technology and the future revenue to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
the estimated stage of completion expressed as a percentage of completion for each project was calculated and then was applied to the net cash flows for the product 
the cash flows were then discounted back to their net present value 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million  or  for the year ended december  the decrease was mainly due to a decrease of million in personnel related expenses due to a decrease in headcount and million in professional services expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in non cash compensation expense 
non cash compensation expense 
in connection with the grant of certain employee stock options  we recorded aggregate unearned stock based compensation expenses of million 
this balance represents the total difference between the exercise price of the option and the deemed fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of issuance in relation to options granted prior to our initial public offering 
during  we recorded amortization of stock based compensation expense related to the grant of certain employee stock options of million compared to million in at december   approximately million of unearned stock based compensation remained to be amortized 
on august   we implemented a stock option exchange program the program 
under the program  holders of outstanding options with an exercise price of or greater per share the eligible options were given the choice of retaining these options or canceling the options in exchange for i restricted shares of common stock restricted stock to be issued as soon as possible after the expiration of the program period and or ii replacement options issuable six months and one day following the cancellation of the program at the closing market price on that date 
on october   we amended the program to provide the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the company  if they participated in the program  with a separate restricted stock agreement the ceo and cfo agreement  which includes specific vesting provisions based on achieving certain performance goals 
 options were subject to the program  which closed on october  employees tendered  stock options and received  shares of restricted stock pursuant to the program 
in addition  employees tendered  stock options which were cancelled and will be replaced six months and one day following expiration of the program 
the tendered stock options represented approximately of our total outstanding stock options as of the expiration date of the program 

table of contents in addition  in october  we issued  shares of restricted stock to our employees residing in the united kingdom  including to our chief executive officer 
the restricted stock issued to our chief executive officer is subject to the ceo and cfo agreement 
the program has been accounted for under the guidance of emerging issues task force issue no 
issues related to the accounting for stock compensation under apb opinion no 
and interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
because we offered to cancel existing fixed stock options in exchange for a grant of restricted stock within six months of the cancellation date of the existing options  the eligible options became subject to variable accounting treatment at the commencement date of the program 
variable accounting ceased upon cancellation of the tendered options 
a total of  eligible options that were not tendered will remain subject to variable accounting 
we recorded million of unearned stock based compensation expense based on the fair market value of the restricted stock at the date of issuance of which million was recorded as compensation expense at december  we recorded million of unearned stock based compensation expense related to the options that were not tendered based on the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the stock at december  of which million was expensed at december  the compensation expense on variable options will be re measured at the end of each operating period until the options are exercised  forfeited or expired 
depending upon movements in the market value of our common stock  this accounting treatment may result in significant additional stock based compensation charges in future periods 
we also recorded stock based compensation expense of million and million for and  respectively  in conjunction with notes receivable with current and former executives 
the total stock based compensation expense by operating expense is described as follows in thousands years ended december  cost of net revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total in september  we issued warrants to accenture plc to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
no warrants have vested through december on august   we entered into an agreement with ibm to market our products and services to customers 
we issued a fully vested and exercisable warrant to purchase up to million shares of common stock 
the exercise price is set at per share 
the warrants expire on august  the warrants were valued at million based on the black scholes model using the following assumptions volatility  risk free rate and fair market value of our common stock at the grant date 
the value of the warrants are recorded as a prepaid expense  and will be offset against revenue on future ibm revenue generating transactions 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles assets for the year ended december   was million of which million is attributable to the acquisition of ondemand in march and million is attributable to the acquisition of prime response in march the remaining balance of million is related to the acquisitions of certain assets from actionpoint and asp outfitter in may and technology from eds in december 
table of contents there was no amortization of goodwill in as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  we ceased to amortize the unamortized goodwill balances of approximately million  including million of acquired workforce in place that was reclassified to goodwill during additionally  there was no amortization of the million of goodwill recorded as a result of the ondemand acquisition 
amortization of goodwill during the year ended december  represented million 
restructuring costs during  several areas of the company were restructured to prioritize our initiatives around services  sales  training and research and development business  reduce expenses and improve efficiency in order to achieve cash flow and profitability breakeven in the near future 
this restructuring program included a worldwide workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities and restructuring of certain business functions 
workforce reduction the restructuring program resulted in the reduction of regular employees representing annual savings of approximately million 
all areas of the company were affected by this restructuring 
we recorded a total workforce reduction charge of approximately million for the year ended december  relating to severance and benefits 
consolidation of excess facilities we accrued for lease costs of million during pertaining to the estimated future obligations for non cancelable lease payments for the consolidation of excess facilities relating to lease terminations and non cancelable lease costs 
this charge included estimated sub lease income based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets 
if facilities rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  the maximum amount the actual loss could exceed the original estimate is approximately million

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and change in the market values of our investments 
the following table presents the amounts of short term investments and restricted cash that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  fair value short term investments and restricted cash average interest rates the following table presents the amounts of short term investments and restricted cash that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  fair value short term investments and restricted cash average interest rates interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our investment portfolio 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues from our foreign subsidiaries accounted for approximately of total revenues during international sales are made mostly from our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
additionally  one of our foreign subsidiaries holds cash equivalent investments in currencies other than their respective local currency 
such holdings increase our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
as exchange rates vary  the holdings may magnify foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or upon translation or adversely impact overall expected profitability through foreign currency losses incurred upon the sale or maturity of the investments 
foreign currency losses  net for the year ended december  was less than million 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to changing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility when compared to the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
