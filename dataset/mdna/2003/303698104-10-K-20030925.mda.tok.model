item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the fairchild corporation was incorporated in october  under the laws of the state of delaware 
banner aerospace holding company i  inc is a owned subsidiary 
fairchild holding corp 
is our indirect owned subsidiary 
fairchild holding corp 
is the owner of fairchild aerostructures  inc  and the indirect owner of of warthog inc 
our principal operations are conducted through banner aerospace holding company i  fairchild aerostructures  and warthog 
our consolidated financial statements present the results of our former fastener business  and aps  a small subsidiary being sold  as discontinued operations 
the following discussion and analysis provide information which management believes is relevant to the assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
general our business consists of three segments aerospace distribution  aerospace manufacturing  and real estate operations 
our aerospace distribution segment stocks and distributes a wide variety of aircraft parts to commercial airlines and air cargo carriers  fixed base operators  corporate aircraft operators and other aerospace companies worldwide 
our aerospace manufacturing segment primarily manufactures airframe components 
our real estate operations segment owns and leases a shopping center located in farmingdale  new york  and owns and rents two improved parcels located in southern california 
on december   we completed the sale of our fastener business to alcoa inc for approximately million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the cash received from alcoa is subject to a post closing adjustment based upon the net working capital of the fastener business on december   compared with its net working capital as of march  see item  note  for further discussion 
we may also receive additional cash proceeds up to million per year over the four year period from to  if the number of commercial aircraft delivered by boeing and airbus exceeds specified annual levels 
we are continuing to investigate how best to redeploy our cash in opportunities which will enable us to build for the long term 
accordingly  we are actively pursuing worldwide acquisition opportunities in diverse business segments

these statements also relate to our future prospects  developments and business strategies 
these forward looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  plan  predict  project  will and similar terms and phrases  including references to assumptions 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including current trend information  projections for deliveries  backlog and other trend estimates that may cause our actual future activities and results of operations to be materially different from those suggested or described in this financial discussion and analysis by management 
these risks include our ability to find  acquire and successfully operate one or more new businesses  product demand  our dependence on the aerospace industry  customer satisfaction and quality issues  labor disputes  competition  our ability to achieve and execute internal business plans  worldwide political instability and economic growth  military conflicts  reduced airline revenues as a result of the september  terrorist attacks on the united states  and their aftermath  reduced airline revenues due to sars  and the impact of any economic downturns and inflation

we do not intend to update the forward looking statements included in this annual report  even if new information  future events or other circumstances have made them incorrect or misleading 
critical accounting policies on december   the securities and exchange commission issued release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that involve subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates 
in response to release no 
 we reviewed our accounting policies 
the following areas require the use of judgments and estimates the valuation of long lived assets  impairment of goodwill  pension and postretirement benefits  income taxes  environmental and litigation accruals and revenue recognition 
estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and a variety of assumptions that we believe are appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
valuation of long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment  including property  plant and equipment  and identifiable intangibles with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of our long lived assets  we evaluate the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be greater than the carrying amount of our assets 
impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of our assets and their estimated fair value 
impairment of goodwill on july   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
since the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized 
instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life  goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist 
all of our goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and as a result of adopting sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill 
pension and postretirement benefits we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our employees 
our funding policy is to make the minimum annual contribution required by the employee retirement income security act of or local statutory law 
the accumulated benefit obligation for pensions and postretirement benefits was determined using a discount rate of at june  and at june  and a return on plan assets of at june  and at june  the effect of such change resulted in an increase to the accumulated benefit obligation in assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans 
for measurement purposes in  we assumed a annual rate of increase in the cost per capita of claims covered under health care benefits 
beginning in  the trend rate is assumed to decrease each year by to a rate of in and remain at that level thereafter 
deferred and noncurrent income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
environmental matters our current and prior operations are subject to stringent government imposed environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials 
to date  such laws and regulations have not had a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or net cash flows  although we have expended  and can be expected to expend in the future  significant amounts for the investigation of environmental conditions and installation of environmental control facilities  remediation of environmental conditions and other similar matters 
in connection with our plans to dispose of certain real estate  we must investigate environmental conditions and we may be required to take certain corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition 
in addition  we have identified several areas of potential contamination related to other facilities owned  or previously owned  by us  that may require us either to take corrective action or to contribute to a clean up 
we are also a defendant in several lawsuits and proceedings seeking to require us to pay for investigation or remediation of environmental matters  and we have been alleged to be a potentially responsible party at various superfund sites 
we believe that we have recorded adequate accruals in our consolidated financial statements to complete such investigation and take any necessary corrective actions or make any necessary contributions 
no amounts have been recorded as due from third parties  including insurers  or set off against  any environmental liability  unless such parties are contractually obligated to contribute and are not disputing such liability 
legal matters we are involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental to our business 
we  either on our own or through our insurance carriers  are contesting these matters 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate resolution of the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  future results of operations  or net cash flows 
revenue recognition sales and related costs are recognized upon shipment of products and or performance of services  when collection is probable 
sales and related cost of sales on long term contracts are recognized as products are delivered and services performed  as determined by the percentage of completion method 
lease and rental revenue are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
shipping and handling amounts billed to customers are classified as revenues

the pbgc expressed concern that our retirement plan would be underfunded by million after the sale of our fasteners business 
we provided the pbgc with information  which represented the underfunding to be million  using the pbgc plan termination assumptions 
during  we contributed million of cash to fund this pension plan 
based upon our actuary s assumptions and projections  we do not expect additional cash contributions to this pension plan to be required until at june   we had contractual commitments to repay debt including capital lease obligations  and to make payments under operating leases 
payments due under these long term obligations are as follows thereafter total long term debt and capital lease obligations operating lease commitments total contractual cash obligations we have entered into standby letter of credit arrangements with insurance companies and others  issued primarily to guarantee our future performance of contracts 
at june   we had contingent liabilities of million on commitments related to outstanding letters of credit 
in addition  we have million classified as other long term liabilities at june   including environmental and other liabilities  which do not have specific payment terms or other similar contractual arrangements 
at june   we have million of federal income tax loss carryforwards expiring through  and million of unused alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards that do not expire 
these federal income tax loss carryforwards may be reduced by adjustments during the income tax audits of through  which have not been completed 
as the periods of assessment for to have expired  additional tax may be collected from us only for to nonetheless  the tax losses of million arising in   and may still be reduced for determining the proper amount of net operating loss available to be carried forward to years after the gain we reported between to  for federal income tax  may be significantly increased if our tax positions are not sustained with respect to the sales of several businesses  and the repayment with property  of debt under a bank credit agreement in which both we and our subsidiaries were liable  is not tre ated as tax free under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
if all of these adjustments were made for to  the federal income tax loss carryforwards would be substantially reduced  and we may be required to pay additional tax and interest of up to million  which has already been provided 
the amount of additional tax and interest to be paid by the company depends on the amount of income tax audit adjustments  which are made and sustained for to these adjustments  if any  would be made at a future date  which is presently uncertain  and therefore we cannot predict the timing of cash outflows 
to the extent a favorable final determination of the recorded tax liabilities occurs  appropriate adjustments will be made to decrease the recorded tax liability in the year such favorable determination will occur 
it is presently uncertain when a final determination will occur since no internal revenue service audits of to have been completed 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred and applies prospectively to such activities initiated after december  this standard has no impact on our financial statements

this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivatives and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard has no impact on our financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in fiscal  we entered into a ten year interest rate swap agreement to reduce our cash flow exposure to increases in interest rates on variable rate debt 
the ten year interest rate swap agreement provides us with interest rate protection on million of variable rate debt  with interest being calculated based on a fixed libor rate of to february  on february   the bank  with which we entered into the interest rate swap agreement  did not exercise a one time option to cancel the agreement  and accordingly the transaction will proceed  based on a fixed libor rate of from february  to february  the interest rate swap agreement was executed to provide an economic hedge against cash flow variability on the floating rate note 
when evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on this hedge relationship  we assessed the key characteristics of the interest rate swap agreement and the note 
based on this assessment  we determined that the hedging relationship would not be highly effective 
the ineffectiveness is caused by the existence of the embedded written call option in the interest rate swap agreement  and the absence of a mirror option in the hedged item 
as such  pursuant to sfas no 
 we designated the interest rate swap agreement in the no hedging designation category 
accordingly  we do not use hedge accounting 
we have recognized a non cash decrease in the fair market value of interest rate derivatives  of million  million and million in   and  respectively  as a result of the fair market value adjustment for our interest rate swap agreement 
the fair market value adjustment of these agreements will generally fluctuate based on the implied forward interest rate curve for month libor 
if the implied forward interest rate curve decreases  the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will increase and we will record an additional charge 
if the implied forward interest rate curve increases  the fair market value of the interest hedge contract will decrease  and we will record income
