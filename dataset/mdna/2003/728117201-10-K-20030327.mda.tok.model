item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our inception in as the publisher of playboy magazine  we have expanded our operations to encompass entertainment businesses that are related to the content and style of playboy magazine 
today  an important aspect of our businesses consists of the licensing of our trademarks for the worldwide manufacture  sale and distribution of various consumer products and services 
our trademarks  which are renewable periodically and which can be renewed indefinitely  include playboy  the rabbit head design  playmate  spice and sarah coventry 
we also own numerous domain names related to our online business 
our businesses are currently classified into four reportable segments entertainment  publishing  playboy online and licensing businesses 
formerly  we operated a fifth segment  catalog  which we divested in connection with our sale of the collectors choice music catalog in november and the critics choice video catalog in october revenues most of our entertainment group revenues are derived from ppv and subscription fees for our television network offerings  including playboy tv and spice branded domestic and international networks  and sales of dvds and home videos 
entertainment revenues are affected by ppv and subscription retail prices both of which are set by the dth and cable operators  revenue splits with the dth and cable operators and the demand for our programming 
the majority of our publishing group revenues is derived from subscription and newsstand sales of the magazine and special editions  the sale of advertising space and the licensing of international editions 
the subscription based revenues are fairly consistent  while newsstand sales fluctuate and are typically higher for issues containing major celebrities or other special content  such as interviews 
publishing group revenues fluctuate with the general condition of the local and national economy 
revenue fluctuations are also due primarily to higher pricing of our holiday issues and fluctuations in expenditure levels by national advertisers depending on economic conditions  product introductions by advertising customers and changes in advertising buying patterns generally 
the principal sources of playboy online group revenues are subscription revenues for our websites offering unique playboy branded content  e commerce sales of playboy branded and other consumer products  advertising and revenues generated by international licensing transactions for websites outside of the united states 
e commerce revenues are typically higher during the holiday buying season and lower due to decreased internet traffic during the summer months when people tend to be outside more often 
licensing businesses group revenues are principally generated through the international and domestic distribution of playboy branded consumer products and playboy sponsored marketing events such as the playboy jazz festival  and periodic auction sales of small portions of our art and memorabilia collection 
costs and operating expenses entertainment group expenses include programming amortization  network distribution  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
amortization expenses relate primarily to the expenditures associated with the creation of playboy programming and licensing of third party programming for our movie networks 
publishing group expenses include manufacturing  subscription promotion  editorial  shipping and general and administrative expenses 
manufacturing expenses represent the largest operating expense of the publishing group and fluctuate by issue due mainly to the cost of paper and the size of the magazine 
playboy online group expenses consist of trademark license and administrative fees to the parent company  content  product fulfillment  sales and marketing  hosting and general and administrative expenses 
licensing businesses group expenses include promotional expenses and general and administrative expenses 
corporate administration and promotion expenses include general corporate costs such as finance  technology  legal  security and human resources as well as company wide marketing and promotion and the expenses related to the playboy mansion

partially offsetting the above were higher domestic tv networks revenues as a result of the califa acquisition in july  and higher playboy online and licensing businesses group revenues due in part to their global expansion 
operating performance improved million compared to the prior year due to better performance from all of our operating groups  primarily playboy online  combined with lower corporate administration and promotion expenses 
the current year included a million restructuring charge compared to a million charge in the prior year 
the charge in both periods included severance and consolidation of office space 
the lower net loss for included a million noncash income tax charge related to our adoption of statement  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the prior year included a million noncash charge representing a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of statement of position  or sop   accounting by producers or distributors of films 
entertainment group in december  we completed the restructuring of the ownership of our international tv joint ventures with claxson 
the restructuring significantly expanded our ownership of playboy tv and movie networks outside of the united states and canada 
under the terms of the restructuring transaction  we increased our equity interest in networks in europe and the pacific far east and retained our existing ownership interest in the playboy tv and spice branded networks in latin america and iberia 
the following discussion focuses on the profit contribution of each of our entertainment group businesses before programming expense 
profit contribution from domestic tv networks for increased million on a revenue increase of million  or  primarily due to the addition of the movie networks from the califa acquisition 
in  we expect to see a flattening in domestic tv revenues while we continue to capitalize on the rollout of digital technology by increasing the number of addressable homes our networks are available to  as well as the number of networks on each system 
additionally  our goal is to increase the number of systems that also offer playboy tv on a monthly subscription basis 
our networks were available as follows dec 
 dec 
 household units in millions playboy tv dth cable digital cable analog addressable playboy tv en espanol dth cable digital movie networks dth cable digital cable analog addressable each household unit is defined as one household carrying one given network per carriage platform 
a single household can represent multiple household units if two or more of our networks and or multiple platforms ie digital and analog are available to that household 
we obtained distribution rights of playboy tv en espanol in the us hispanic market in december in connection with the restructuring of the ownership of our international tv joint ventures 
prior to the restructuring  this network was included in international tv s household units 
revenues and profit contribution from the international tv business decreased million and million  respectively  due to our not receiving the september library license fee payment of million from ptvi under the old joint venture agreement 
partially offsetting the above were higher sales of output programming to ptvi 
as previously discussed  in december  we restructured the ownership of our international tv joint ventures with claxson 
we accounted for this transaction as an unwinding of the ptvi joint venture and final payment under the original sale of assets and licensing agreement  which resulted in the recognition of million in additional revenues 
in return for our increased ownership in ptvi and the other terms of the restructuring transaction  among other things  a we forgave approximately million in current programming and other receivables due from ptvi  b we will no longer receive the library or output agreement payments that we were scheduled to receive under the original agreement and c claxson is released from its remaining funding obligations to ptvi 
with the recent expansion of our ownership in playboy tv and movie networks outside of the united states and canada and by offering such a diverse range of networks  we will seek to increase penetration in our existing international markets as more television homes have access to digital technology and expand our reach into other international markets 
however  in the near term we expect lower operating margins from this business as a result of consolidating ptvi under our new ownership rather than recording licensing fees as in the past 
this  coupled with the flattening of domestic tv revenues  is expected to lead to a decline in entertainment group profitability in profit contribution from our worldwide home video business increased million on a revenue increase of million  or  mainly due to the absence of a domestic distributor in the prior year third quarter 
the contract with our previous distributor expired in june  and the contract with our current distributor became effective in october partially offsetting the above were higher revenues in the prior year of million related to a change in accounting in accordance with sop  accounting by producers or distributors of films  which primarily impacted the domestic business 
programming amortization expense increased million compared to the prior year as a result of a higher number of original programs premiering on domestic playboy tv and the addition of licensed programming for the movie networks from the califa acquisition 
the group incurred expenses in the current year of million related to relocating its california office space and moving to its new studio production facility during the current year 
publishing group playboy magazine revenues decreased million  or  for due mostly to lower advertising and newsstand revenues 
in spite of this  the publishing group reported improved performance for of million 
advertising revenues decreased million  or  due to fewer ad pages  partially offset by higher average net revenue per page 
advertising sales for the first quarter magazine issues are closed  and we expect to report fewer ad pages and lower ad revenues compared to the first quarter 
newsstand revenues were million lower principally due to fewer us and canadian newsstand copies sold in the current year 
subscription revenues were higher 
other domestic publishing revenues decreased million  or  for compared to the prior year primarily due to lower newsstand sales of special editions 
international publishing revenues decreased million  or  due to the sale in july of the majority of our equity interest in vipress  our polish publishing joint venture 
as a result we no longer consolidate its results 
we sold our remaining equity interest in the joint venture in october the group s segment performance for increased due in part to cost reduction measures implemented in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
additionally  manufacturing costs decreased million  driven by lower paper prices combined with fewer printed pages in playboy magazine largely as a result of the fewer ad pages 
significantly lower editorial costs of million also favorably impacted the comparison 
the lower playboy magazine and special editions newsstand revenues and the lower advertising revenues partially offset the lower costs and expenses 
in  we expect the continuing benefit of cost reductions plus growth in ad revenues to more than offset the transitional costs of moving editorial staff from chicago to new york under the direction of the magazine s new editor 
additionally  the group expects to benefit from the sales of playboy s th anniversary issue in december 
playboy online group playboy online group revenues for increased million  or  to million 
subscription revenues increased million  or  due to growth in members  the up pricing of playboy cyber club and the launch of new clubs 
other revenues increased million  or  primarily as a result of licensing fees generated by international website deals  including in germany  korea  the netherlands and taiwan 
e commerce revenues were down million  or  mostly due to the sale of our collectors choice music business in november combined with the continuation of the strategy to increase profit margins with more targeted circulation 
the group s segment loss decreased million mainly due to a combination of the higher revenues plus cost saving initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of in accordance with an agreement  the group paid trademark fees to the parent company of million in the current year compared to million in we expect to achieve profitability for the group in principally through the continued growth of our subscription business 
licensing businesses group segment income for from the licensing businesses group increased million  or  on a revenue increase of million  or 
higher royalties from our international licensed branded products business of million  revenues of million related to an auction held with butterfields auctioneers and ebay in june of a small portion of our art and memorabilia collection and the favorable impact of cost reduction measures implemented in the fourth quarter of were responsible for the improved performance 
we expect to continue to increase the group s profitability in by expanding our product lines and outlets 
catalog group in november  we sold our collectors choice music business  ending our presence in the nonbranded print catalog business 
corporate administration and promotion corporate administration and promotion expenses for decreased million  or  compared to the prior year 
this improvement was primarily a result of no longer amortizing trademarks in the current year due to the adoption of statement  goodwill and other intangible assets  lower marketing expenses and a greater reduction of expenses related to the higher trademark fees from the playboy online group 
partially offsetting the above were expenses related to the addition of a president and chief operating officer position in the current year 
we expect corporate administration and promotion expenses to be slightly lower in than in restructuring expenses in  we announced a company wide restructuring initiative in order to reduce our ongoing operating expenses 
in connection with the restructuring  we reported a million charge in  of which million related to the termination of employees and million related to the consolidation of our office space in los angeles and chicago 
also in  a million unfavorable adjustment was made to the restructuring discussed below primarily due to a change in sublease assumptions 
in  we implemented a restructuring plan in anticipation of a continuing weak economy

compared to our revenues for decreased million  or  compared to the prior year primarily due to the sale of our critics choice video business in october in november  we also sold our collectors choice music business  ending our presence in the nonbranded print catalog business 
the comparison also reflected lower playboy magazine revenues combined with higher domestic tv networks revenues  largely due to the califa acquisition in july operating performance improved million in compared to the prior year primarily due to the factors discussed above combined with better performance from the playboy online and licensing businesses groups and lower corporate administration and promotion expenses 
the operating loss for also included a lower loss related to the sale of collectors choice music compared to the loss related to the sale of critics choice video in the lower net loss for reflected significantly lower income tax expense related to our decision in to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
also included in the net loss was a million noncash charge representing a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of sop  accounting by producers or distributors of film 
additionally  reflected higher interest expense primarily due to mostly noncash imputed interest related to the deferred payment of the purchase price for the califa acquisition

see part i 
item legal proceedings 
a second letter of credit in the amount of million was also issued in january as collateral for the supersedeas bond  but was not provided under the credit facility 
as a result  we cash collateralized the million letter of credit with the issuing bank 
debt financings the credit facility provided that outstanding borrowings carry interest at rates equal to specified index rates plus margins that fluctuated based on our leverage ratio 
the term loans consisted of two tranches  tranche a and tranche b  which carried margins of and  respectively  over the london interbank offering rate  or libor 
we were assessed a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility

after the date that is three years after the date the playboy preferred stock is issued  if at any time the weighted average closing price of our class b stock for consecutive trading days equals or exceeds of the conversion price  we will have the option  by delivering a written notice to holders of shares of playboy preferred stock  to convert any or all shares of playboy preferred stock into the number of shares of class b stock determined by dividing a the sum of the aggregate stated value of such playboy preferred stock and the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends by b the conversion price

income taxes in  we evaluated our net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  and other deferred tax assets and liabilities in relation to our recent earnings history 
as a result of this review  we decided to adopt a more conservative approach by increasing the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  which resulted in noncash federal income tax expense of million 
the increase in the valuation allowance was due primarily to the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss 
of the increase in the valuation allowance  million was due to the deferred tax treatment of certain acquired intangibles as a result of the adoption of statement  goodwill and other intangible assets  and the remainder was primarily due to the deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes

prior to the implementation of statement  goodwill and other intangible assets  in  trademark acquisition costs were capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over years  and trademark defense  registration and or renewal costs were capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over years 
beginning in  trademark related costs are no longer being amortized  since our trademarks have indefinite lives  but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the new accounting standard 
for periods after  capitalized amounts related to our trademarks are generally higher than they would have been had the old accounting standards continued to apply

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to manage the risk associated with our exposure to such fluctuations  we enter into various hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures 
we have derivative instruments that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  which are entered into in order to hedge the variability of cash flows to be paid related to a recognized liability and cash flows to be received related to forecasted royalty revenues 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that was scheduled to mature in may that effectively converted million of our floating rate debt to fixed rate debt  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense 
in march  in connection with the termination of our former credit facility  we also terminated this swap agreement for million 
in addition  to protect against the reduction in value of foreign currency cash flows  we hedge portions of our forecasted royalty revenues denominated in foreign currencies  primarily japanese yen and the euro  with forward contracts 
we hedge these royalties for periods not exceeding months 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions 
we link all hedges that are designated as cash flow hedges to floating rate liabilities or forecasted transactions on the balance sheet 
we also assess  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items 
should it be determined that a derivative is not effective as a hedge  we will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
we prepared sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates 
based on our sensitivity analyses at december  and  such a change in interest rates would affect our annual consolidated operating results  financial position and cash flows by approximately million and million  respectively 
at december  and  we had an interest rate swap agreement in place to effectively convert million of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate of and  respectively  thereby significantly reducing our risk related to interest rate fluctuations 
we also prepared sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of a hypothetical devaluation of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies of the countries to which we have exposure  primarily japan and germany 
based on our sensitivity analyses at december  and  such a change in foreign currency exchange rates would affect our annual consolidated operating results  financial position and cash flows by approximately million and million  respectively 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
