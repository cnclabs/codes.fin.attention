item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the subsidiaries of williams industries  inc provide specialized services and products for the construction industry 
they operate in the commercial  industrial  governmental and infrastructure construction markets  with the operating components divided into construction and manufacturing segments 
the services provided include steel  precast concrete and miscellaneous metals erection and installation  crane rental and rigging  fabrication of welded steel plate girders  rolled beams  stay in place bridge decking  and light structural and other metal products 
management continually reviews the company s allocation of assets to each subsidiary and makes adjustments as necessary to enhance the company s ability to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace 
since fiscal  the company has increased its emphasis on its manufacturing segment 
manufacturing  which was of the company s business in fiscal  comprised of revenues in fiscal while this increase is due in part to the expansion of the company into leased facilities in alabama  the decline in revenues in the construction segment also contributed to this shift 
while management anticipates growth in the next four to five years in the company s manufacturing segment due to increased governmental demand for highway projects  significant opportunities are also occurring in the industrial and institutional construction markets 
the amount of commercial  institutional  and governmental construction activity in the mid atlantic region  where the company traditionally has focused its efforts  continues to be higher than in many other regions in recent years  but budgetary problems continue to plague the states  including maryland and virginia 
geographic expansion has allowed the company to achieve growth and to remove some of the vagaries of working only in concentrated areas 
although  demand for the company s products and services related to government spending on infrastructure remained strong during the year ended july   inclement weather  schedule delays by customers  raw material delivery delays and a decline in new contracts by government agencies affected the company s ability to perform work 
near record snow falls  followed by heavy rains  shut down or delayed many jobs 
there continues to be a strong demand for the company s bridge girders and stay in place decking  due in part to continued governmental spending on infrastructure 
the company s bridge girder company was successful in its bid on the woodrow wilson bridge contract to supply girders for the virginia approach 
at the same time  the company s stay in place decking company obtained contracts for several sections of the same bridge 
these contracts total approximately million and will extend over the next four years 
during the fiscal year ended july   the company took action to curtail continuing losses associated with the activities of the company s former sales and services segment 
for many years  the company has rented cranes and related heavy construction equipment to non related entities in the construction industry 
during the past months  revenues from such rentals declined 
after a thorough analysis  the company closed its jessup  maryland office  and essential activities previously performed by the sales and services segment were consolidated into the company s construction segment 
the company intends to sell equipment that is not necessary for its own operations  and is attempting to renegotiate or cancel leases on leased equipment 
revenues and direct costs of the former sales and services segment  which prior to fiscal were shown separately  are now included in the company s construction segment 
while most of the company s construction activities are focused in maryland  virginia  and the district of columbia  the company now has manufacturing facilities in the southeast 
products are shipped well beyond both regions 
the company s long range plan calls for the continued leverage of existing subsidiaries to produce the most cost effective and customer responsive combination of manufacturing and construction capabilities 
the company s ability to offer a turnkey approach for its customers  thereby increasing its competitiveness on some contracts  will continue to be a strength 
effective january   the company changed its worker s compensation insurance carrier 
the new program offers significantly better cash flow and slightly lower fixed costs 
in the past  the company paid in advance for its entire worker s compensation costs for the year 
under the new program  there are no upfront payments required 
the carrier s base fee  which is a portion of the total program cost  is paid out over the policy year 
all other costs are paid by the carrier and reimbursed by the company on a monthly basis  resulting in improved cash flow during the year 
financial condition between july  and july   the following changes occurred the company s cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and certificates of deposit decreased million as the company used cash on hand at july  and cash provided by operations during the year ended july  to purchase equipment  fund plant expansion  and pay down debt 
accounts receivable declined approximately million 
trade receivables increased  as rigging work related to maintenance and rehabilitation work remained strong 
contract receivables declined million while work on current backlog has been delayed 
other receivables declined  as the company received cash on receivables 
the company collected approximately  for retentions on the job on which the company has a contract claim receivable 
in addition  the company recorded a claim in the amount of  this claim has proceeded through the mediation stage and an examination of the records that support this claim is scheduled for september  the company believes this claim will be collected during the year ended july  inventory declined approximately million 
the company used existing inventories to produce its products 
additionally  raw material prices have declined  reducing the need to hedge against price increases 
costs and estimated earning in excess of billings increased million because the company fabricated girders on jobs where the customer could not be billed until the product was fully fabricated or delivered to the job 
prepaid expenses decreased  due to a change in the company s workers compensation insurance carrier during the fiscal year in the past  the company paid its entire workers compensation costs in advance  while under the new program  the carrier s base fee is paid out over the policy year 
property and equipment  at cost increased million as the company purchased one new crane  refinanced three cranes which it had previously leased  capitalized construction costs and plant equipment costs at its manufacturing segment facilities and purchased other miscellaneous equipment 
the company retired fully depreciated equipment with an original cost of million 
deferred income taxes increased  due primarily to the reduction of the valuation allowance that was placed against the capital loss carryforward that the company was not able to utilize and expired on july  other assets decreased  as the company reclassified costs  which had previously been deferred  to property and equipment  at cost 
these costs were mainly associated with the plant expansions at its bedford  virginia and gadsden  alabama plants 
notes payable decreased  the company borrowed approximately million  million of which was used to fund long term plant and equipment purchases and million was used to fund short term operations 
the company paid back million related to short term borrowing  mainly from operations 
accounts payable increased  as the company delayed payments to vendors related to contracts on which it had not received payment 
accrued compensation and related liabilities decreased million due to a decrease in incentive compensation 
billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts increased  this increase relates to certain contracts where the company was able to bill for materials purchased but not yet fabricated 
income taxes payable decreased  due to state tax payments and recording of refunds 
stockholders equity decreased  primarily due to operating losses 
the company also repurchased company stock for  and issued stock for  bonding the company has a comprehensive bonding program with a primary underwriter that is believed to be more than sufficient for the company s needs 
although the company s ability to bond work is more than adequate  the company has traditionally relied on its superior reputation to acquire work and will continue to do so 
however  the company recognizes that  as it expands its geographic range for providing goods and services  it may be necessary to provide bonds to customers unfamiliar with the company 
liquidity the company s operations require significant working capital to procure materials for contracts to be performed over relatively long periods  and for purchases and modifications of specialized equipment 
furthermore  in accordance with normal payment terms  the company s customers often retain a portion of amounts otherwise payable to the company as a guarantee of project completion 
to the extent the company is unable to receive progress payments in the early stages of a project  the company s cash flow could be adversely affected 
the issue of progress payments is a common one in the construction industry as are short term cash considerations 
the company generated million in cash from operations during the year ended july  the company used million to fund investing activities and used cash in financing activities of  cash and cash equivalent decreased million from million at july  to million at july  the company paid approximately  to former shareholders of sip inc of delaware under the terms of its purchase agreement for a interest in that company 
management believes that operations will generate sufficient cash to fund activities 
however  as revenues increase  it may become necessary to increase the company s credit facilities to handle short term cash requirements 
management  therefore  is focusing on the proper allocation of resources to ensure stable growth 
the company is not in compliance with one of the covenants contained in its agreements with united bank and with wachovia bank 
the agreements state that the company must maintain a debt service coverage ratio of or greater 
due to the company s loss for the year ended july   that ratio was 
the company has obtained a waiver  with no conditions from united bank  and a waiver from wachovia bank that requires the company to achieve earnings performance as follows produce a net profit of  for the quarter ending october   a net profit of  through the six months ending january   a net profit of  through the nine months ending april  and a net profit of  for the year ending july  operations the company s manufacturing subsidiaries continue to benefit from strong demand for their products and services  while the construction segment has seen a decline in commercial demand but a steady increase in governmental projects 
additional consolidation of resources  including both personnel and equipment  will occur until the company has the most efficient configuration for market conditions 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year the year ended july  was a difficult year 
record snows and above average rain  delayed material shipments as well as starting dates on jobs 
the former sales and services segment  due to declining revenues and increasing losses  was downsized and consolidated with the construction segment 
the company continued expansion of the manufacturing segment with the opening of the gadsden  alabama facility and the completion of an addition to the bedford  virginia plant 
finally  during the year  the company was awarded contracts aggregating approximately million for the woodrow wilson bridge project 
the work for this project will involve most of the company s subsidiaries 
the company recorded a loss of  or per share  on revenues of million for the year ended july  compared to a profit of million  or per share  on revenues of million for the year ended july  revenues decreased by million 
manufacturing revenues increased by 
million while construction revenues decreased million 
construction segment revenue was adversely impacted by project delays due to inclement weather and by the downsizing of crane rental operations 
gross profit declined million as gross profit percentages decreased 
the construction segment s gross margin decreased four percent mainly due to increased competition 
the manufacturing segment s gross profit decreased approximately nine percent due also to increased competition  and the fact that during the last ten months of fiscal  the bessemer  alabama plant was working on time and material contracts that were residual to the plant s former owner 
these contracts were produced at higher margins than those currently in the plant because the customer supplied the material 
while overhead increased slightly  overhead in the construction segment decreased by more than  due to the downsizing of the crane rental operation 
this decrease was offset by increases in the manufacturing segment related to increased revenues 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million due mainly to a decrease in incentive compensation of million 
depreciation increased  due to property and plant additions  mainly in the manufacturing segment 
interest expense decreased due to lower interest rates on short term borrowing and reduced debt 
the income tax benefit provision decreased million for the year ended july  due primarily to the company s losses 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year expansion in the company s manufacturing segment dominated fiscal  with the segment showing a increase in revenues when compared to fiscal while a portion of this improvement was due to the addition of the leased facility in bessemer  alabama  the bulk of the increase was due to higher sales in existing markets 
this was particularly significant because williams bridge company s strongest traditional customers  the states of virginia and maryland  did not bid much work due to severe budgetary concerns 
williams bridge company not only produced more work but also produced higher profit margins when the years are compared 
it is also significant to note that the addition of the bessemer plant was responsible for approximately  in increased g a costs for the subsidiary  overhead increasing accordingly 
the construction segment revenues remained constant when the years ended july  an are compared 
while the segment s erection operations revenue increased  the increases were offset by decreases in revenues in crane rental operations 
direct costs increased  due to workers compensation expenses due to a series of accidents  and because the segment had substantial fixed cost expenses  such as crane leases 
profit margins declined sharply on reduced revenues 
part of the equipment rental operation s difficulties stemmed from new competition in the marketplace  but concerns involved accidents  the segment s inability to sell underperforming assets and changes in the segment s sales staff 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year the single most significant difference between fiscal and fiscal was the addition of sip inc of delaware to the company s consolidated results 
the addition of sip was a major contributor to the manufacturing segment s increase in both revenues and profitability  although the entire segment continued to benefit from consistent order flow for bridge girders and decking  both components of the federal government s extensive infrastructure funding program 
the increasing proportion of revenues generated by manufacturing is expected to continue as funding for infrastructure programs is scheduled to continue for at least five years 
in the construction segment  in the absence of many mega or extremely large construction projects  the construction operations performed a multitude of smaller jobs in fiscal to keep its revenues close to those of fiscal institutional projects  such as schools and post offices  comprised a significant component of the segment s work in contrast to the commercial construction of the prior year 
equipment rental operation also had an increase in revenues when the years are compared 
some of the increase was attributed to the company s consolidation of crane management  which allowed higher utilization for both long and short term projects 
more coordinated scheduling also permitted the company to seize emergency  time sensitive opportunities  which generally produced higher profit margins 
the company took advantage of conditions in the overall economy to restructure several long term debt obligations  reducing the average interest rate of its variable rate obligations by nearly two percent and the rate on its total fixed interest notes by approximately 
these savings are reflected on the company s income statement 
the company s provision for income taxes must also be evaluated when reviewing bottom line results 
as a result of the company s ability to use some of its tax loss carryforwards  the fiscal provision of  was substantially less than the fiscal provision of  the company s future utilization of its remaining tax loss carryforwards will continue to be evaluated on a yearly basis 
off balance sheet arrangements except as shown below in aggregate contractual obligations and in note  leases  the company has no off balance sheet arrangements
