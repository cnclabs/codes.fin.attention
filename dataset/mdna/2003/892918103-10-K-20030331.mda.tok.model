plant consolidation during in february  we announced plans to establish a global engineering and manufacturing center at our ithaca  ny facility 
as part of this strategic decision  we undertook a plan to consolidate all manufacturing and engineering into our existing ithaca  ny facility and close our wallingford  ct facility the consolidation 
however  our company headquarters remains in wallingford  ct 
our technology shift to inkjet and thermal printing from dot matrix impact printing has dramatically reduced the labor content in our printers  and therefore  lowers the required production capacity 
as of december   we successfully transferred substantially all our wallingford product lines to ithaca  ny  with the exception of a small component production line and service depot that remain in connecticut 
the closing of the wallingford facility resulted in the termination of employment of approximately production  administrative and management employees 
through december   we have incurred approximately million of non recurring costs associated with the consolidation  including severance pay  stay bonuses  employee benefits  moving expenses  non cancelable lease payments  and other costs  of which approximately  and  were recognized in and  respectively 
we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to the consolidation during see the liquidity and capital resources section for a discussion of the expected impact of the consolidation on our future results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the presentation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  inventory obsolescence  the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  depreciable lives of equipment  warranty obligations  and restructuring accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
in preparing the financial statements  we are required to make estimation judgments 
such judgments are based upon historical experience and certain assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the particular circumstances 
those judgments affect both balance sheet items and income statement categories 
we evaluate our assumptions on an ongoing basis by comparing actual results with our estimates 
actual results may differ from the original estimates 
the following accounting policies are those that we believe to be most critical in the preparation of our financial statements 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we write down our inventory for any material that has become obsolete or may become unsaleable based on historical usage and estimates of future demand in the market 
assumptions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made  as necessary  to reflect changed conditions 
should circumstances change and we determine that additional inventory is subject to obsolescence  additional write downs of inventory could result in a charge to income 
deferred tax assets we have recorded deferred tax assets  largely as the result of temporary differences between the tax basis of certain reserves including restructuring  inventory  warranty and other reserves and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
during  we established a valuation allowance on a portion of our foreign tax credits  research and development credits and certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
based on our projection of future taxable income and our ability to carryback current year net operating losses  no additional valuation allowance is considered necessary 
we will need to recognize approximately million in future taxable income in order to realize all of our deferred tax assets at december  should circumstances change and we determine that some or all of the deferred taxes would not be realized  a valuation allowance would be recorded resulting in a charge to income in the period the determination is made 
accrued restructuring expenses in connection with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities  we have recorded significant accruals 
these accruals comprise severance pay  stay bonuses  employee benefits  non cancelable lease costs and certain other expenses 
management has made reasonable estimates of such costs and expenses 
however  if actual costs differ from the estimates  charges or credits to income could result in the period the adjustments are determined 
also  because certain moving and relocation costs are not accruable under generally accepted accounting principles in the us  those expenses are recorded as incurred 
we do not expect to record any additional charges related to the consolidation during accrued warranty costs we warranty our products for up to two years and record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale is recorded 
estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience of product returns and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs 
if actual future product return rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates  adjustments to the accrued warranty liability would be made 
a results of operations i year ended december  compared to year ended december net sales 
net sales by market for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended year ended in thousands december  december  point of sale   gaming and lottery   other   international   net sales for decreased  or  from largely due to lower shipments into the company s point of sale pos and other markets 
overall  international sales decreased by  or  primarily due a reduction in revenue related to the british post office project approximately  kiosk printer shipments for use in a canadian government application approximately  shipments of our thermal fiscal printer in europe approximately  and pos revenue through distribution in europe and latin america approximately  partially offset by an increase in international sales of our gaming and lottery printers approximately 
point of sale sales of our pos printers decreased approximately  or 
international pos printer shipments decreased approximately  or  to  for several reasons 
first  sales to icl pathway for the british post office project  which included printer shipments  spare parts and service revenue  declined by approximately  to  in we completed shipping printers for the british post office project during the first quarter of  and expect no future sales for this project  other than spare parts and service of approximately  per quarter during secondly  shipments of our thermal fiscal printer in europe declined by approximately  to  in although we continue to pursue sales of our fiscal printer  such sales are principally project oriented  and we cannot predict if and when future sales may occur 
lastly  we experienced a decrease of approximately  in sales through distribution  primarily in latin america  and to a lesser extent  in europe 
we continue to actively seek additional distribution partners in both latin america and europe in order to increase our breadth of coverage and future sales in these regions 
domestic pos printer sales totaling  fell by  or  as we experienced softness in demand from our domestic distributors  particularly in the first and third quarters of however  sales in included increasing sales of our posjet line of inkjet printers  which we expect to continue into due to on going economic weakness and continued lower capital spending by users of our pos products  we expect continued worldwide softness in demand for our pos products in as a result  we expect sales into the pos market for the first quarter of to be consistent with those reported for the fourth quarter of gaming and lottery sales into the gaming and lottery market increased by  or  from  primarily due to stronger sales of our video lottery terminal vlt and slot machine printers  largely offset by lower sales of lottery printers to gtech 
shipments to gtech  which included on line and in lane lottery printers and spare parts revenue  decreased  to approximately  in sales of impact on line lottery printers and spare parts totaled approximately  in  compared to  in we have approximately  of orders from gtech for impact on line lottery printers for delivery in the first quarter of we do not expect any further shipments of impact on line lottery printers in beyond the first quarter 
shipments of in lane lottery printers totaled approximately  in compared to  in since sales of in lane lottery printers are project oriented  we cannot predict if and when future sales may occur 
in july  we entered into a year agreement with gtech to provide a newly designed thermal on line lottery printer 
we have received an initial order from gtech for approximately million of our new thermal on line lottery printers  all of which we expect to ship during  with volume shipments beginning in the second quarter of we expect to receive additional thermal printer orders from gtech for delivery in sales of our gaming printers  which included vlt and slot machine printers  and related spare parts and repairs  increased by approximately  to  the increase in gaming printer sales resulted from two factors  increased installations of our vlt printers in west virginia and other states  including approximately  of sales of a custom printer to one customer and increased sales of our casino printers  primarily for use in slot machines at casinos throughout north america that print receipts instead of issuing coins ticket in  ticket out 
based on existing orders and sales opportunities  we expect sales of our casino printers to continue to increase in  beginning in the second quarter  as more regulatory approvals are expected to be obtained and more casinos are expected to convert to ticket in  ticket out slot machines 
we also expect sales of our vlt printers to increase in compared to due to the vlt initiative in the state of new york 
other sales of our printers into other markets decreased by  or  to  from during  we shipped approximately  of our thermal kiosk printers for use in a canadian government application 
we made no shipments of these printers in we do not expect to make any future shipments for this application 
in addition  sales of our other kiosk and banking printers and related spare parts declined by approximately  since printer sales into these markets are principally project oriented  we cannot predict if and when future sales may occur 
due to steadily declining sales and low anticipated future sales  we have decided to exit these markets 
as such  beginning in the first quarter of  we will combine any remaining sales from our other markets into pos market sales  and no longer separately report sales in our other market category 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by  or  to  and the gross margin also increased to from 
both gross profit and gross margin for benefited from an improved sales mix and cost reductions resulting from the consolidation 
we expect gross margin for the first quarter of to be consistent with that of the full year  and to increase in the second quarter of  as we begin volume shipments of our new thermal on line lottery printer to gtech and anticipate increasing sales of our slot machine printers 
engineering and product development 
engineering  design and product development expenses decreased  or  and also decreased as a percentage of net sales to from 
this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in engineering staff at our wallingford  ct facility due to the consolidation 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased  or  and decreased as a percentage of net sales to from 
such expenses decreased mostly due to lower planned promotional and advertising expenses and staff reductions resulting from the consolidation 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  and decreased as a percentage of net sales to from 
the decrease primarily resulted from staff reductions resulting from the consolidation and the inclusion in of  of accelerated depreciation on certain assets located at the company s wallingford  ct facility primarily leasehold improvements and computer equipment whose useful lives were shortened as a result of the consolidation 
business consolidation and restructuring 
we incurred  of expenses related to the consolidation in these expenses were substantially the result of a revision to our estimate for non cancelable lease payments included in the restructuring accrual at september  based on regional softness in demand in the commercial real estate market  we increased our restructuring accrual by  to reflect the longer period of time now projected to sublease our wallingford  ct facility 
the accrual now includes estimated non cancelable lease payments and other related costs through september  we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to the consolidation during during  we incurred approximately  of consolidation expenses  which primarily included a portion of employee severance and termination related expenses and facility closure and consolidation expenses including moving expenses  estimated non cancelable lease payments and other costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating loss 
during  we reported an operating loss of  or of net sales  compared to an operating loss of  or of net sales  in the reduction in our operating loss was due to significantly reduced operating expenses as a direct result of the consolidation  lower consolidation expenses and higher gross margin 
interest 
net interest expense decreased by  to  in  due largely to a significant reduction in our average outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank facility resulting from significantly lower inventories approximately  receipt of an advance payment from a customer  and to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
we expect revolving borrowings to increase to approximately million by the end of the first quarter of  as we purchase inventory for anticipated higher sales volume in the second quarter of as a result  we expect interest expense to increase in the first quarter of see liquidity and capital resources below 
other income 
other income for includes a one time gain of  resulting from the receipt of  shares of common stock from our health insurance company  anthem  inc  upon its demutualization 
we sold these shares during the third quarter of this gain was partially offset by approximately  of transaction exchange loss recorded by our uk subsidiary during  due to the strengthening of the british pound against the dollar  mostly in the second quarter of income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of  and  in and  respectively  at an effective rate of approximately in each period 
we expect to record income taxes at a similar effective rate during net loss 
we reported a net loss in of  or per share basic and diluted after giving effect to  of dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock 
this compares to a net loss of  or per share basic and diluted after giving effect to  of dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock in in future quarters  dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock will be approximately  before the effect of any conversion or redemption of the preferred stock 
ii year ended december  compared to year ended december net sales 
net sales by market for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended year ended in thousands december  december  point of sale   gaming and lottery   other   international   net sales for decreased  or  from largely due to significantly lower shipments into the company s pos market 
international sales decreased to  or of net sales in  from  or of net sales in point of sale sales of our pos printers decreased approximately  or 
international pos printer shipments decreased approximately  to  largely due to lower printer shipments to icl pathway for the british post office project 
sales for the british post office project  which included printer shipments and service revenue  were approximately  in compared to  in we completed shipping printers for the british post office project during the first quarter of  and no future sales  other than spare parts and service  are expected 
in addition to lower sales to icl pathway  we experienced a decrease in sales  primarily to europe  of approximately  through okidata  our former exclusive distribution partner in europe 
as of may  okidata no longer exclusively distributes our printers in europe 
we also experienced a decline of approximately  of sales to latin america through okidata  our distribution partner in latin america 
the decrease in international pos sales to icl pathway and okidata was somewhat offset by an increase of approximately  of shipments of our thermal fiscal printer in europe 
despite adverse economic conditions  domestic pos printer sales increased slightly by  to  gaming and lottery sales of our gaming and lottery printers increased approximately  or  from the prior year 
sales of our on line lottery printers and spare parts to gtech increased by approximately  to approximately  in  compared to  in we received follow on orders from gtech for approximately  of on line lottery printers  of which approximately  was delivered in and  will be delivered in in addition to the increase of printer sales to gtech  sales of our slot machine printers and other gaming printers increased by approximately  the slot machine printers are primarily for use in casinos in california and nevada 
offsetting the increase of on line lottery printer and spare parts sales to gtech and increased slot machine printer sales was a decrease of approximately  in sales of our vlt printers to approximately  in sales of these vlt printers were unusually high in the last half of other sales of our printers into other markets decreased by  or  from the prior year 
during  sales of our atm printer and related spare parts decreased by approximately  in addition  sales decreased by approximately  due to sales of kiosk printers to customers for projects primarily in the third quarter of that did not repeat in offsetting these decreases was an increase of approximately  of our thermal kiosk printers for use in a canadian government application during no shipments of these printers were made in since printer sales into the kiosk printer market are principally project oriented  the company cannot predict if and when future sales may occur 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased  or  and the gross margin also declined to from 
both gross profit and gross margin for were adversely impacted by lower sales volume  due primarily to the absence of printer shipments for the british post office project 
engineering and product development 
engineering  design and product development expenses decreased  or  to  from this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in engineering staff at our wallingford facility resulting from the consolidation 
engineering and product development expense increased as a percentage of net sales to from  due to lower sales volume in compared to selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased  or  to  from the prior year 
such expenses decreased primarily due to unusually high marketing and promotional expenses incurred in related to the april launch of our new family of printers utilizing inkjet printing technology and a reduction in marketing staff 
selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to from  due to lower sales volume in compared to general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  from and increased as a percentage of net sales to from 
the increase in expenses primarily resulted from the inclusion of  of accelerated depreciation on certain assets primarily leasehold improvements and computer equipment located at our wallingford  ct facility whose useful lives have been shortened as a result of the consolidation 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of staff and certain related expenses at our wallingford  ct facility resulting from the consolidation 
business consolidation and restructuring 
during  we incurred approximately  of business consolidation and restructuring expenses related to the consolidation 
these expenses primarily included employee severance and termination related expenses  and facility closure and consolidation expenses including moving expenses  estimated non cancelable lease payments and other costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating loss 
we incurred an operating loss of  in compared to an operating loss of  in the operating loss in resulted primarily from lower gross profit on lower sales in compared to as well as expenses related to the consolidation 
interest 
net interest expense decreased to  from  in due to decreased average outstanding borrowings on our line of credit and a lower average interest rate on such borrowings 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
income taxes 
as a result of our loss before income taxes  we recorded an income tax benefit of  and  or an effective rate of and  in and  respectively 
the abnormally high effective tax benefit rate in is primarily due to the recognition of certain tax credits and the benefit from our foreign sales corporation on relatively low pre tax amounts 
net loss 
we incurred a net loss during of  or per share basic and diluted after giving effect to  of dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock issued in april this compares to a net loss for of  or per share basic and diluted after giving effect to  of dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock issued in april in future quarters  dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock will be approximately  before the effect of any conversion or redemption of the preferred stock 
b liquidity and capital resources cash flow we generated cash from operations of  in  compared to  in the significant increase in cash generated from operations in was largely the result of a significantly reduced net loss 
during  we reported a net loss of  compared to  in during  depreciation and amortization totaled  compared to  in such expenses in included accelerated depreciation and depreciation on certain leasehold improvements and other fixed assets that were disposed of during as a result of the consolidation 
deferred taxes  net of an increase in refundable income taxes  decreased by  due primarily to a refund of taxes received in as a result of a net operating loss carryback 
in order to utilize all of our deferred tax assets at december  approximately million  we will need to generate approximately million of taxable income in future years 
receivables decreased only slightly from year end approximately 
inventories were significantly reduced during by approximately  due to improved inventory management and changes related to inventory absolescence 
despite our continued focus on inventory reduction  we expect inventories to increase in the first quarter of  as we prepare for volume shipments of our new thermal on line lottery printer for gtech and anticipated increasing sales of our gaming printers in the second quarter of accounts payable increased slightly from the prior year end approximately  and we expect accounts payable to increase in the first quarter of in proportion to our expected inventory increase 
accrued liabilities and other liabilities  excluding accrued restructuring  increased by  primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue on an extended warranty contract with a certain customer 
offsetting the activities providing cash in the year was a net reduction in the restructuring accrual of  representing payouts for severance pay and related benefits and lease payments for the wallingford facility of  offset by an additional accrual of  primarily for lease termination expenses see consolidation expenses below 
our capital expenditures were approximately  and  in and  respectively 
these expenditures for primarily included new product tooling and computer equipment 
we expect capital expenditures for to be approximately  primarily for tooling for our new thermal lottery printer for gtech and other new products 
we used  in financing activities  largely due to repayments on our revolving credit facility and term loan and payments of cash dividends on our preferred stock 
working capital our working capital increased to  at december  from  at december  the current ratio also increased to to at december  from to at december  the increase in both working capital and the current ratio was largely due to lower inventories  and a decrease in the current portion of accrued restructuring expenses of approximately  related to the consolidation 
contingent liabilities in november  we were advised that certain pos printers sold by us since late may use technology covered by recently issued patents of a third party competitor 
we are analyzing the cited patents for validity and applicability to our products 
in an effort to resolve this matter  we have offered to pay approximately  while the other party seeks payment of up to  the patent resolution payment 
while the outcome of our patent analysis and discussions cannot be predicted  we have recognized a charge of  in cost of sales in the fourth quarter of this charge represents what we believe to be a fair and reasonable payment 
credit facility and borrowings on may   we entered into a three year  million credit facility the lasalle credit facility with lasalle business credit  inc lasalle expiring on may  to replace its prior credit facility with webster bank 
the lasalle credit facility provides a million revolving credit line  a million term loan and a million equipment loan facility 
borrowings under the lasalle credit facility bear a floating rate of interest based on lasalle s prime rate 
under certain circumstances  we may select a fixed interest rate for a specified period of time of up to days on borrowings based on the current libor rate 
on october   we amended the lasalle credit facility 
under the terms of the amendment lasalle amendment no 
 lasalle waived compliance with the minimum ebitda financial covenant as of september   revised certain other financial covenants through december   increased the floating rate of interest on borrowings under the revolving credit line to lasalle s prime rate plus  or the current libor rate plus  and increased the floating rate of interest on borrowings under the term loan and equipment loan to lasalle s prime rate plus  or the current libor rate plus 
upon execution of lasalle amendment no 
 we paid a fee of  to lasalle 
on december   we amended the lasalle credit facility to reset certain financial covenants for and beyond lasalle amendment no 

upon execution of lasalle amendment no 
 we paid a fee of  to lasalle 
on november   we amended the lasalle credit facility 
under the terms of the amendment lasalle amendment no 
 lasalle waived compliance with the minimum ebitda  minimum tangible net worth and fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants as of september  and revised these covenants to exclude the effect of  of the total  of restructuring charges incurred in the third quarter 
absent the  restructuring charge  we would have been in compliance with the above covenants at september  upon execution of lasalle amendment no 
 we paid a fee of  to lasalle 
on march   we amended the lasalle credit facility 
under the terms of the amendment lasalle amendment no 
 lasalle waived compliance with the minimum ebitda covenant as of december   revised this covenant and certain other financial covenants through may and eliminated the availability of the million equipment loan facility due to expire in may in addition  lasalle has restricted million of our borrowing availability under the revolving credit line pending the outcome of the patent resolution payment 
upon execution of lasalle amendment no 
 we paid a fee of  to lasalle 
as of december  we had  and  outstanding on the revolving credit line and term loan  respectively  and no borrowings under the equipment loan  leaving undrawn commitments under the lasalle credit facility of  annual principal payments on the term loan are  sale of preferred stock on april  we sold  shares of series b cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock the preferred stock to advance capital advisors  lp and its affiliate in consideration of  per share the stated value  for a total of  less issuance costs of approximately  the preferred stock is redeemable by the holders on april  at  per share plus any unpaid dividends 
we used the net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we paid  in and  and  in  of cash dividends to advance capital advisors  lp and expect to pay  in capital expenditures our capital expenditures were approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
these expenditures primarily included new product tooling  and to a lesser extent  computer equipment  and factory machinery and equipment 
our capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately  a majority for new product tooling 
consolidation expenses during  we incurred approximately  of business consolidation  restructuring and related charges as a result of the consolidation 
these expenses primarily included employee severance and termination related expenses  facility closure and consolidation expenses including moving expenses  estimated non cancelable lease payments and other costs and accelerated depreciation and asset disposal losses on certain leasehold improvements and other fixed assets 
although the consolidation was substantially completed in  we incurred an additional  of non recurring costs associated with the consolidation during during  we revised our estimate for non cancelable lease payments included in the restructuring accrual 
based on regional softness in demand in the commercial real estate market  we increased the restructuring accrual by  to reflect the longer period of time now projected to sublease our wallingford  ct facility 
the accrual now includes estimated non cancelable lease payments and other related costs through approximately september  as a result of the consolidation  we have significantly lowered our cost structure in  with annual cost savings of over million compared to we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to the consolidation during see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
of the total of  of consolidation expenses  approximately  requires cash outlays 
we paid approximately  and  of these costs  in and  respectively 
we expect to pay approximately  of these costs in  and the remaining  in as a result of the consolidation  we realized improved gross margins and lower operating expenses in  and lowered our operating income breakeven point from million to million in sales  which we believe will provide us with additional operating leverage in resource sufficiency we believe that cash flows generated from operations and borrowings available under the lasalle credit facility  as amended  will provide sufficient resources to meet the company s working capital needs  including costs associated with the consolidation and the patent resolution payment  finance its capital expenditures and meet its liquidity requirements through december  however  we recognize that the level of financial resources available to us is an important competitive factor  and we will consider additional financing sources as appropriate  including raising additional equity capital on an on going basis as market factors and our needs suggest 
we currently expect to refinance any outstanding borrowings at the expiration of the lasalle credit facility in may c impact of inflation transact believes that its business has not been affected to a significant degree by inflationary trends because of the low rate of inflation during the past three years  nor does it believe it will be significantly affected by inflation during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under the lasalle credit facility 
these borrowings bear interest at variable rates and the fair value of this indebtedness is not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
an effective increase or decrease of in the current effective interest rates under the lasalle credit facility would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or cash flow 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  the company has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results in the future 
the company does not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on the company s future results of operations or cash flow
