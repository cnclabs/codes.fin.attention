item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company appearing under item herein 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed 
such reclassifications do not affect earnings or stockholders equity 
general business 
omega is the largest us producer of protein rich meal and oil derived from marine sources 
the company s products are produced from menhaden a herring like fish found in commercial quantities  and include faq grade and value added specialty fish meals  crude and refined fish oils and fish solubles 
the company s fish meal products are used as nutritional feed additives by animal feed manufacturers and by commercial livestock producers 
the company s crude fish oil is sold to food producers and aquaculture feed manufacturers in europe and asia and its refined fish oil products are used in food production and certain industrial applications 
fish solubles are sold as protein additives for animal feed and as fertilizers 
the fish catch is processed into faq grade fish meal  specialty fish meals  fish oils and fish solubles at the company s four operating plants located in virginia  mississippi and louisiana 
the company utilized fishing vessels and spotter craft in the harvesting operations during menhaden are harvested offshore the us mid atlantic and gulf of mexico coasts 
in  the company converted several of its fishing vessels to carry vessels which do not engage in active fishing but instead carry fish from the company s offshore fishing vessels to its plants 
utilization of carry vessels increases the amount of time that certain of the company s fishing vessels remain offshore fishing productive waters and therefore increases the company s fish catch per vessel employed 
since  the company s fish catch per vessel has increased 
the carry vessels have reduced crews and crew expenses and incur less maintenance cost than the actual fishing vessels 
harvesting and production 
the following table summarizes the company s harvesting and production for the indicated periods years ended december  fish catch tons    production tons fish meal regular grade    special select    sea lac    silver herring  oil crude    refined    solubles    total production    fish catch has been converted to tons using the national marine fisheries service nmfs fish catch conversion ratio of pounds per  fish 
the company s harvesting season generally extends from may through december on the mid atlantic coast and from april through october on the gulf coast 
during the off season and the first few months of each fishing season  the company fills purchase orders from the inventory it has accumulated during the previous fishing season 
prices for the company s products tend to be lower during the fishing season when product is more abundant than in the off season 
throughout the entire year  prices are significantly influenced by supply and demand in world markets for competing products  particularly other globally produced fish meal as well as soybean meal for its fish meal products and vegetable fats and oils for its fish oil products when used as an alternative to vegetable fats and oils 
during and continuing through  world grain and oilseed markets were burdened by excess supplies relative to demand which  in turn  resulted in prices for most major commodities being sharply lower than in previous years 
correspondingly  the company s product prices were adversely impacted during these periods  resulting in decreased gross margins 
during and again during  the company determined that the costs of its fish meal and fish oil product inventories were in excess of those products realization value by approximately million and million  respectively 
this realization was due mainly to the continuing depressed market values of world protein markets and particularly  animal and oilseed oil markets 
the average prices received for the company s fish meal and fish oil products were approximately and lower  respectively  during as compared to price decreases continued during and fish meal and fish oil prices were approximately and  respectively  lower than average prices 
also impacting and contributing to the write down of inventories was the reduced crude fish oil production yields approximately lower yields compared to experienced during the majority of the fishing season in the gulf of mexico 
these reduced yields were primarily a result of the reduced fat content in the fish  which was a result of poor nutritional conditions caused by the extreme drought conditions suffered by the gulf of mexico region during late and early the depressed pricing conditions of years and continued into the early months of before making significant improvements late in and continuing throughout these price increases were the result of diminished global fish meal and fish oil inventories as opposed to a weaker world demand for other competing products 
management believes that it is possible that these price increases have reached a plateau and stabilized at this time 
future product price volatility will depend upon the perceived international availability of fish meal and fish oil inventories 
accordingly  gross profit margins may vary in the future 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  the company is continuing its efforts towards the production and marketing of specialty meal products  which generally have higher margins than the company s faq meal product 
since  the company s sales volumes of specialty meal products has increased approximately 
additionally  the company is attempting to introduce its refined fish oil into the food market 
the company has had some success selling its refined fish oil  trademarked omegapure tm  to food manufacturers in the united states and canada at prices that provide substantially improved margins over the margins that can be obtained from selling non refined crude fish oil 
the company cannot estimate  however  the size of the actual domestic market for omegapure tm or how long it may take to develop this market 
historically  approximately to of omega s faq fish meal was sold on a two to twelve month forward contract basis 
the balance of regular grade and other products was substantially sold on a spot basis through purchase orders 
the company began a similar forward sales program for its specialty grade meals and crude fish oil for and will continue this program for the company s annual revenues are highly dependent on both annual fish catch and inventories and  in addition  inventory is generally carried over from one year to another year 
the company determines the level of inventory to be carried over based on prevailing market prices of the products and anticipated customer usage and demand during the off season 
thus  production volume does not necessarily correlate with sales volume in the same year and sales volumes will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the company s fish meal products have a useable life of approximately one year from date of production 
practically  however  the company typically attempts to empty its warehouses of the previous season s products by the second or third month of the new fishing season 
the company s crude fish oil products do not lose efficacy unless exposed to oxygen and therefore  their storage life typically is longer than that of fish meal 
the following table sets forth the company s revenues by product in millions and the approximate percentage of total revenues represented thereby  for the indicated periods years ended december  revenues percent revenues percent revenues percent regular grade 
special select sea lac crude oil refined oil fish solubles 
nets and other total liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been cash flows from operations  bank credit facilities and term loans from various lenders provided pursuant to the national marine fisheries finance program under title xi of the marine act of title xi 
these sources of cash flows have been used for capital expenditures and payment of long term debt 
the company expects to finance future expenditures through internally generated cash flows and  if necessary  through funds available from the credit facility and or title xi facilities described below 
under a program offered through national marine fisheries services nmfs pursuant to title xi  the company has secured loans through lenders with terms generally ranging between and years at interest rates between and per annum which are enhanced with a government guaranty to the lender for up to of the financing 
the company s current title xi borrowings are secured by liens on fishing vessels and mortgages on the company s reedville  virginia and abbeville  louisiana plants 
in  title xi borrowing was modified to permit use of proceeds from borrowings obtained through this program for shoreside construction 
the company used the entire million amount originally authorized under the program 
loans are now available under similar terms pursuant to the title xi program without intervening lenders 
the company borrowed million under this new program during omega had an unrestricted cash balance of million at december   up million from december  this increase was due primarily to operating profits as a result of increased selling prices for the company s products 
the company s liquidity is greatly influenced by the selling prices received for its products 
should the company experience decreased pricing in the future  as it experienced in and  liquidity would decline and the company would possibly have to utilize its working capital credit facility 
the company s long term debt at december  and was million and million  respectively 
current maturities attributable to the company s long term debt was million both at december  and the company did not utilize its working capital credit facility during and other than for million and million in standby letters of credit as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   the company had million available under its working capital credit facility 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements other than normal operating leases and standby letters of credit 
the following tables aggregate information about the company s contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in thousands as of december payments due by period less than to to after contractual cash obligations total year years years years long term debt      operating leases  minimum pension liability   total contractual cash obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period less than to to after other commercial commitments total year years years years credit facility  standby letters of credit   total commercial commitments   as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings outstanding under the million credit facility 
investing activities used million in while using million and million during  and  respectively 
the company s investing activities in  and consisted mainly of capital expenditures for equipment purchases  replacements and vessel refurbishments 
the company anticipates making approximately million of capital expenditures in  a significant portion of which will be used to refurbish vessels and plant assets and to repair certain equipment 
financing activities used million in and million during  respectively  to repay debt 
due to million in proceeds from title xi borrowings  net financing activities in provided  on december   the company entered into a million revolving credit agreement with bank of america  na the credit facility 
under the credit facility the company may make borrowings in a principal amount not to exceed million at any time 
borrowings under this facility may be used to finance ongoing working capital needs  to make acquisitions  and to issue standby or commercial letters of credit 
interest accrues on borrowings that will be outstanding under the credit facility at either i libor plus basis points or ii at the company s option  the bank s prime rate 
the credit facility is collateralized by all of the company s trade receivables  inventory and equipment 
the company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with certain financial covenants  including maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth and maintenance of minimum ebitda 
in addition  the credit facility does not allow for the payment of cash dividends or stock repurchases and also limits capital expenditures and investments 
through december   the company had made no borrowings under the credit facility other than for standby letters of credit of which million were outstanding as of december  the current credit facility expires on december  the company s principal raw material is menhaden  a species of fish that inhabits coastal and inland tidal waters in the united states 
menhaden are undesirable for human consumption due to their small size  prominent bones and high oil content 
certain state agencies impose resource depletion restrictions on menhaden pursuant to fisheries management legislation or regulations 
to date  the company has not experienced any material adverse impact on its fish catch or results of operations as a result of these restrictions 
the company from time to time considers potential transactions including  but not limited to  enhancement of physical facilities to improve production capabilities and the acquisition of other businesses 
certain of the potential transactions reviewed by the company would  if completed  result in its entering new lines of business generally including certain businesses to which the company sells its products such as pet food manufacturers  aquaculture feed manufacturers  fertilizer companies and organic foods distributors although historically  reviewed opportunities have been generally related in some manner to the company s existing operations 
although the company does not  as of the date hereof  have any commitment with respect to a material acquisition  it could enter into such agreement in the future 
in january  the united states supreme court ruled that  in addition to the united states coast guard  the occupational safety and health administration has the authority to regulate working conditions aboard certain types of vessels which include the company s fishing vessels 
the eventual implementation of this ruling which is expected to occur over a period of years is expected to result in additional safety requirements and procedures for the company s vessels 
it is possible that the costs of these requirements and procedures could be material 
the company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and jones act liability for employees aboard its vessels collectively  vessel claims insurance 
the typical vessel claims insurance policy contains an annual aggregate deductible aad for which the company remains responsible  while the insurance carrier is responsible for all applicable amounts which exceed the aad 
it is the company s policy to accrue current amounts due and record amounts paid out on each claim 
once payments exceed the aad  the company records an insurance receivable for a given policy year 
during  the company s vessel claims insurance carrier for the policy period october  through march  filed for bankruptcy protection 
this bankruptcy filing caused the company to provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for a significant portion of the amounts due to the company from the insurance carrier 
a general hardening of the world insurance markets in recent years has made the company s insurance more costly and is likely to continue to do so as various lines of insurance come up for renewal in depending on the magnitude of the increase in insurance premiums  the company may elect to increase its deductibles and self retentions in order to achieve lower insurance premium costs 
these higher deductibles and self retentions will expose the company to greater risk of loss if claims occur 
the company believes that the existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funds available through its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the end of significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein  including estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant of these requiring difficult or complex judgments in any particular period involve the costing of inventory  including inventory lower of cost or market analyses and the company s accounting for various losses on self insurance retentions 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company s fishing season runs from mid april to the first of november in the gulf of mexico and from the beginning of may into december in the atlantic 
government regulations generally preclude the company from fishing during the off seasons 
the company s inventory cost system considers all costs associated with an annual fish catch and its processing  both variable and fixed and including both costs incurred during the off season and during the fishing season 
the company s costing system allocates cost to inventory quantities on a per unit basis as calculated by a formula that considers total estimated inventoriable costs for a fishing season including off season costs to total estimated fish catch and the relative fair market value of the individual products produced 
the company adjusts the cost of sales  off season costs and inventory balances at the end of each quarter based on revised estimates of total inventoriable costs and fish catch 
the company s lower of cost or market value analyses at year end and at interim periods compares to total estimated per unit production cost of the company s expected production to the projected per unit market prices of the products 
the impairment analyses involve estimates of  among other things  future fish catches and related costs  and expected commodity prices for the fish products 
these estimates  which management believes are reasonable and supportable  involve estimates of future activities and events which are inherently imprecise and from which actual results may differ materially 
revisions in such estimates or actual results could materially impact the company s results of operation and financial position 
during the off seasons  in connection with the upcoming fishing seasons  the company incurs costs ie  plant and vessel related labor  utilities  rent  repairs and depreciation that are directly related to the company s infrastructure 
these costs accumulate in inventory and are applied as elements of the cost of production of the company s products throughout the fishing season ratably based on the company s monthly fish catch and the expected total fish catch for the season 
as mentioned previously  the company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and jones act liabilities for employees aboard its vessel 
the company provides reserves for those portions of the aad for which the company remains responsible by using an estimation process that considers company specific and industry data as well as management s experience  assumptions and consultation with outside counsel 
management s current estimated range of liabilities related to such cases is based on claims for which management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
the company has recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
as additional information becomes available  the company will assess the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revise its estimates 
such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the company s results of operation and financial position

seasonal and quarterly results the company s menhaden harvesting and processing business is seasonal in nature 
the company generally has higher sales during the menhaden harvesting season which includes the second and third quarter of each year due to increased product availability  but prices during the fishing season tend to be lower than during the off season 
as a result  the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future 
in addition  from time to time the company defers sales of inventory based on worldwide prices for competing products that affect prices for the company s products which may affect comparable period comparisons 
quarterly financial data contained in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report are incorporated herein by reference 
significant factors that may affect forward looking statements the company wishes to caution investors that the following significant factors  and those factors described elsewhere in this report  other filings by the company with the sec from time to time and press releases issued by the company  could affect the company s actual results which may differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company the company s ability to meet its raw material requirements through its annual menhaden harvest  which is subject to fluctuation due to natural conditions over which the company has no control  such as varying fish population  adverse weather conditions and disease 
the impact on the company if its spotter aircraft are prohibited or restricted from operating in their normal manner during the company s fishing season 
for example  as a direct result of the september  terrorist attacks  the secretary of transportation issued a federal ground stop order that grounded certain aircraft including the company s fish spotting aircraft for approximately nine days 
this loss of spotter aircraft coverage severely hampered the company s ability to locate menhaden fish during this nine day period and thereby reduced its amount of saleable product 
the impact on the prices for the company s products of worldwide supply and demand relationships over which the company has no control and which tend to fluctuate to a significant extent over the course of a year and from year to year 
the products that influence the supply and demand relationship are world supplies of fish meal made from other fish species  palm oil  soy meal and oil  and other edible oils 
the impact of a violation by the company of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to menhaden fishing and the protection of the environment and the health and safety of its employees or of the adoption of new laws and regulations at federal  state or local levels that restrict or prohibit menhaden or purse seine fishing  or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations that materially adversely affect the company s business 
the impact on the company if it cannot harvest menhaden in us jurisdictional waters if the company fails to comply with us citizenship ownership requirements 
risks inherent in the company s attempt to expand into sales of refined  food grade fish oils for consumption in the us  including the unproven market for this product 
fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results due to the seasonality of the company s business and the company s deferral of sales of inventory based on worldwide prices for competing products 
the ability of the company to retain and recruit key officers and qualified personnel  vessel captains and crewmembers 
risks associated with the strength of local currencies of the countries in which its products are sold  changes in social  political and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations and international trade  including changes in the law and policies that govern foreign investment and international trade in such countries  changes in u 
s laws and regulations relating to foreign investment and trade  changes in tax or other laws  partial or total expatriation  currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation  the disruption of labor  political disturbances  insurrection or war and the effect of requirements of partial local ownership of operations in certain countries 
risks related to unanticipated material adverse outcomes in any pending litigation or any other unfavorable outcomes or settlements 
there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in any pending litigation and to the extent that the company sustains losses growing out of any pending litigation which are not presently reserved or otherwise provided for or insured against  its business  results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in the future the company may undertake acquisitions  although there is no assurance this will occur 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to profitably manage future businesses it may acquire or successfully integrate future businesses it may acquire into the company without substantial costs  delays or other problems which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
a general hardening of the world insurance markets in recent years has made the company s insurance more costly and is likely to continue to increase the company s cost of insurance 
depending on the magnitude of the increase in insurance premiums  the company may elect to increase its deductibles and self retentions in order to achieve lower insurance premium costs 
these higher deductibles and self retentions will expose the company to greater risk of loss if claims occur 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  the financial condition of the company is exposed to minimal market risk associated with interest rate movements on the company s borrowings 
a one percent increase or decrease in the levels of interest rates on variable rate debt would not result in a material change to the company s results of operations 
although the company sells products in foreign countries  all of the company s revenues are billed and paid for in us dollars 
as a result  management does not believe that the company is exposed to any significant foreign country currency exchange risk  and the company does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage its exposure to this risk
