item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of when used in this report  the words or phrases  will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  estimate  believe  or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
important factors that might cause such a difference include  among other things  general economic conditions  particularly the real estate market  in the company s primary market area  credit risk management  asset liability management  changes in government regulation and supervision  changes in interest rates  the availability of and costs associated with sources of liquidity and increased competition and bank consolidations in the company s market area 
the company does not undertake  and specifically disclaims any obligation  to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
general the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses  as well as noninterest income and expenses  minority interest expense and income taxes 
noninterest income consists principally of deposit and other banking fees 
noninterest expenses consist principally of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy  data processing  marketing and professional services costs 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions and changes in interest rates as well as government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
critical accounting policies accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and impact income  are considered critical accounting policies 
seacoast financial considers the following to be its critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses  accounting for acquisitions and the related review of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment and income taxes 
there have been no significant changes in the methods or assumptions used in the accounting policies that require material estimates and assumptions 
allowance for loan losses 
arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
the ongoing evaluation process includes a formal analysis of the allowance each quarter  which considers  among other factors  the character and size of the loan portfolio  business and economic conditions  loan growth  delinquency trends  nonperforming loans trends  charge off experience  portfolio migration data and other asset quality factors 
the company evaluates specific loan status reports on certain commercial and commercial real estate loans rated substandard or worse in excess of a specified dollar amount 
estimated reserves for each of these credits are determined by reviewing current collateral value  financial information  cash flow  payment history and trends and other relevant facts surrounding the particular credit 
analysis of the allowance for loan losses on the remaining commercial  construction and commercial real estate loans are based on pools of similar loans using a combination of historical loss experience and qualitative adjustments 
for the residential real estate and consumer loan portfolios  the range of reserves is calculated by applying loss factors that represent management s estimate of inherent losses in their respective categories to the current outstanding loan balances 
although management uses available information to establish the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require seacoast to recognized adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
accounting for acquisitions and review of goodwill 
seacoast financials growth in business  profitability and market share over the past several years has been enhanced by mergers and acquisitions 
seacoast financials acquisition strategy has utilized both pooling and purchase business combination methods of accounting 
however  current accounting methods currently only allow seacoast financial to use the purchase method of accounting 
for acquisitions under the purchase method  the company is required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party  internal or other valuation techniques 
these estimates also include the establishment of various liabilities based on planned facilities dispositions and employee benefit related considerations  among other acquisition related items 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in goodwill or other intangible assets  which are subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment using discounted future cash flows 
this valuation technique contains estimates such as discount rate  projected future cash flows and time period in its calculations 
furthermore  the determination of which intangible assets have finite lives is subjective  as is the determination of the amortization period for such intangible assets 
income taxes 
seacoast financial uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is established 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
management exercises significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets  including projections of future taxable income 
these judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change

asset quality delinquent loans 
compass s managed asset group performs a monthly review of all delinquent loans with a principal balance in excess of  and reviews the status of each account with the appropriate lending department manager and or account officer 
in addition  compass s board of directors reviews delinquency statistics  by loan type  on a monthly basis 
nantucket bank s loan review committee  which includes all of its loan officers and other officers and directors  reviews the status of all delinquent borrowers on a monthly basis 
nantucket bank s board of directors and or executive committee thereof reviews all loans past due two or more payments each month 
the actions taken with respect to delinquencies vary depending upon the nature of the delinquent loans and the period of delinquency 
the banks asset management philosophy is predicated upon early detection and response to delinquent and default situations 
the banks seek to make arrangements to cure the entire default over the shortest time frame 
generally  the banks require that a delinquency notice be mailed no later than the th day of delinquency 
a second notice is mailed on the th day of delinquency 
a late charge is usually assessed on loans where the scheduled payment is unpaid after days 
after mailing the delinquency notices  the banks asset management staff calls the borrower to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for payment 
on loans secured by one to four family owner occupied properties  the banks attempt to work out a payment schedule with the borrower in order to avoid foreclosure 
if these efforts do not achieve a satisfactory arrangement  the loan is referred to legal counsel and counsel initiates foreclosure proceedings 
at any time prior to a sale of the property at foreclosure  the banks will terminate foreclosure proceedings if the borrower is able to work out a satisfactory payment plan 
on loans secured by commercial real estate properties  the banks also seek to reach a satisfactory payment plan so as to avoid foreclosure 
prior to foreclosure  the banks will generally obtain an updated appraisal of the property 
the following table sets forth a summary of certain delinquency information as of the dates indicated at december  at december  days days or more days days or more number of loans principal balance number of loans principal balance number of loans principal balance number of loans principal balance dollars in thousands real estate loans residential commercial construction home equity commercial loans indirect auto loans other consumer loans total delinquent loans to total loans loan review 
the banks use an internal rating system to monitor and evaluate the credit risk inherent in certain loan portfolios and to identify potential problem loans 
at the time of loan approval  all commercial  commercial real estate and commercial construction loans are assigned a rating based on all of the factors considered in originating the loan 
the initial loan rating is recommended by the loan officer who originated the loan and approved by the individuals or committee responsible for approving the initial loan request 
loan quality ratings are utilized as major criteria in the compilation of the asset watch list 
all loans with loan ratings of special mention  substandard or doubtful are included in a monthly asset watch list 
watch list ratings are an integral part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve 
loan officers are expected to submit appropriate rating changes when facts come to their attention that warrants an upgrade or downgrade in a loan rating 
in addition  loan ratings are generally reviewed on an annual basis 
loans that are rated substandard or doubtful coincide with the classifications used by federal regulators in their examination of financial institutions 
generally  a loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrowers and or the collateral pledged 
substandard loans include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the banks will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  highly questionable and improbable 
loans classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without establishment of a specific loss reserve and or charge off is not warranted 
loans which do not currently expose the banks to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated special mention 
compass also utilizes an independent third party to conduct periodic generally semi annual credit analysis of its commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios and to analyze trends in loan delinquency and non performing loans 
the level of classified loans as determined by compass is reconciled to the level of classified loans as determined by the independent loan review 
on a quarterly basis monthly at nantucket bank  a management group at each bank comprised of senior officers reviews the status and classification of each loan assigned a rating of substandard  doubtful or loss 
loans  or portions of loans  classified loss are charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
these groups also assess the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at each bank  including the general valuation allowance established to recognize the inherent risk associated with each specific category of lending 
in january  the company s board of directors formed a risk management committee at which time the position of senior credit officer at compass was created 
the senior credit officer is responsible for all administrative matters related to the credit function at compass and provides management and the board of directors with such information as loan concentrations  risk rating migration  compliance and tracking of exceptions 
the classification of loans and the amount of the valuation allowances set aside for estimated losses is subject to review by the fdic and the commissioner of banks in massachusetts 
based on their reviews  these agencies can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
the fdic  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on allowances for loan and lease losses 
the policy statement provides guidance for banks on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of a bank s valuation methodology 
generally  the policy statement recommends that banks have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  that management analyze all significant factors that affect the collectibility of loans in a reasonable manner  and that management establish acceptable valuation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
while the banks believe that they have established adequate specific and general allowances for losses on loans  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the allowance for loan losses may become necessary 
see allowance for loan losses 
potential problem loans 
at december   loans designated as substandard or lower in the classification process described above totaled million 
of these classified loans  million were included as nonperforming loans at december  the remaining million in substandard loans were commercial real estate and commercial loans that could become potential problem loans 
these potential problem loans have evidence of one or more weaknesses or potential weaknesses and  depending on the regional economy and other factors  may become nonperforming assets in future periods

restructured loans represent performing loans for which concessions have been granted due to borrower s financial condition 
non performing loans are comprised of non accrual loans and restructured loans 
in previous years  indirect auto loans were not placed on non accrual status due to the expedited manner in which these loans were resolved and the immaterial balance of individual loans 
commencing in  the banks adopted a new policy whereby all consumer and indirect auto loans are charged off when they become days past due 
loans are considered impaired when it is probable that the company will not be able to collect principal  interest and fees according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
total impaired loans at december  and were million and million  respectively 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses based on management s on going evaluation of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
factors considered in the evaluation process include growth of the loan portfolio  the risk characteristics of the types of loans in the portfolio  geographic and large borrower concentrations  current regional economic and real estate market conditions that could affect the ability of borrowers to pay  the value of underlying collateral and trends in loan delinquencies and charge offs 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount management considers adequate to cover estimated losses in the loan portfolio which are deemed probable and estimable based on information currently known to management

the formula based approach evaluates groups of residential  home equity  indirect automobile and other consumer loans to determine the allocation appropriate within each portfolio segment 
individual loans greater than  within the commercial real estate  construction and commercial loan portfolio segments are assigned internal risk ratings to group them with other loans possessing similar credit risk characteristics 
the level of allowance apportionable to each group of risk rated loans is then determined by management applying a loss factor that estimates the amount of probable loss in each category 
the assigned loss factor for each risk rating is a formula based assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions  past experience  and management s subjective analysis of considerations of probable loan loss based on these factors 
allocations for loan categories are then determined by applying loss factors that represent management s estimate of inherent losses in those categories to the appropriate loan balance outstanding 
the other method used to allocate the reserve for loan losses entails the assignment of reserve amounts to individual loans on the basis of loan impairment 
certain loans are evaluated individually and are judged to be impaired when management believes it is probable that the company will not collect all of the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
under this method loans are selected for evaluation based on a change in internal risk rating  occurrence of delinquency  loan classification or non accrual status 
an identifiable reserve amount is allocated to an individual loan when such loan has been deemed impaired and when the amount of a probable loss is estimated on the basis of fair value of collateral  present value of anticipated future cash flows or the loans observable fair market price 
loans with an identifiable allowance and the amount of such allowance totaled million and million at december   respectively 
a portion of the allowance for loan loss is not allocated to any specific segment of the loan portfolio 
this unallocated reserve is maintained for two primary reasons  there exists an inherent subjectivity and imprecision to the analytical processes employed and the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
moreover  management has identified certain risk factors  which could impact the degree of loss sustained within the portfolio 
these include market risk factors  such as the effects of economic variability on the entire portfolio  and unique portfolio risk factors that are inherent characteristics of the company s loan portfolio 
market risk factors may consist of changes to general economic and business conditions that may impact the company s loan portfolio customer base in terms of ability to repay and that may result in changes in value of underlying collateral 
unique portfolio risk factors may include industry concentration or covariant industry concentrations  geographic concentrations  or trends that may exacerbate losses resulting from economic events which the company may not be able to fully diversify out of its portfolio 
management  therefore  has established and maintains an unallocated reserve for loan losses 
the amount of this unallocated reserve was million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in the unallocated reserve is primarily based upon concerns over how the overall weakening of the regional economy may affect borrowers in the company s loan portfolio 
as of december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million as compared to million at december  based on the processes described above  management believes that the level of the reserve for loan losses at december  is adequate 
investments the primary objectives of the investment portfolio are to achieve a competitive rate of return over a reasonable period of time and to provide liquidity 
in view of the banks lending capacity and generally higher rates of return on loans  management prefers lending activities as its primary source of revenue with the securities portfolio serving a secondary role 
the investment portfolio  however  is expected to continue to represent a meaningful not less than portion of total assets 
the current investment strategy has emphasized the purchase of us government and agency obligations and corporate bonds generally maturing or callable within two to five years 
the investment policy permits investments in mortgage backed investments  including cmo s  which typically have longer weighted average lives 
at december   the company had million  or of total assets  in securities consisting primarily of us government and agency obligations million  corporate bonds million  mortgage backed investments million  and marketable equity securities million 
also included in investments is million in restricted equity securities  million of which is in the stock of the fhlb 
to avail itself of services offered by that organization  in particular the ability to borrow funds  the banks are required to invest in the stock of the fhlb in an amount determined on the basis of their residential mortgage loans and borrowings from the fhlb 
the stock is redeemable at par and earns dividends at the discretion of the fhlb 
the company designates its securities as either held to maturity  available for sale or trading depending on management s intent at the time of purchase 
as of december   million  or of the portfolio  was classified as available for sale  million  or of the portfolio  was classified as held to maturity and million  or of the portfolio  was invested in restricted equity securities 
as of december   the net unrealized gain on securities classified as available for sale was million  consisting of net unrealized gains of million on marketable equity securities and million on debt securities 
the company s investment policy requires that corporate bonds be rated investment grade or better at the time of purchase 
due to deterioration in the credit quality of certain corporate bonds  there were bonds with a book value of million and a market value of million  rated below a in the portfolio as of december  included in the above is one issue with a par value of million and a market value of million at december   which was rated below investment grade 
the issuer of such bond is neither in default as to the payment of interest nor has it declared bankruptcy 
an impairment of  was recognized in for this bond 
during  certain equity holdings significantly declined in value  primarily in the telecommunication and auto industries 
the company has identified holdings with a cost basis of million  whose market value decline was deemed to be other than temporary

the banks use deposits  repayments and prepayments of loans  proceeds from sales of loans and securities and proceeds from maturing securities  borrowings and cash flows generated by operations to fund its lending  investing and general operations 
deposits have historically represented the banks primary source of funds 
since the company s initial public offering in november it has relied to a greater extent on borrowings to fund the growth in the loan portfolio 
deposits 
the banks offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and other terms

the dif fully insures amounts in excess of such limits 
at december   deposits of billion were comprised of million of non interest bearing checking accounts and billion of interest bearing deposit accounts  of which billion were certificates of deposit 
of the total of certificates of deposit at december   million  or were scheduled to mature within one year 
based on the monitoring of historical trends  the current pricing strategy for deposits and the general avoidance of brokered deposits  management believes that the banks will retain a significant portion of their certificate of deposit accounts upon maturity 
deposit flows are influenced greatly by economic conditions  the general level of interest rates and the relative attractiveness of competing deposit and investment alternatives 
nantucket bank s deposit flows are also affected by the seasonal economy of its market 
in the recent past  the strength of the stock market had adversely affected deposit flows within the banking industry as some customers opted to place a greater portion of their funds in instruments  such as mutual funds  not directly offered by the banks other than through compass s contractual relationship with invest financial corporation invest and nantucket bank s investment services division  rather than in deposit accounts which they perceived to have less attractive returns 
compass has generally experienced steady deposit inflows in recent years  primarily influenced by regional bank consolidations  competitive pricing and its strong community bank image 
compass s strategy has been to grow deposit levels through targeted promotions  branch expansion and renovation  and bank acquisition 
due to the seasonal tourist related economies on cape cod  martha s vineyard and nantucket  the banks deposits generally peak during the summer months

guarantees 
fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  considers standby letters of credit  excluding commercial letters of credit and other lines of credit  a guarantee of the bank 
the bank enters into a standby letter of credit to guarantee performance of a customer to a third party 
these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements 
the credit risk involved is represented by the contractual amounts of those instruments 
under the standby letters of credit  the bank is required to make payments to the beneficiary of the letters of credit upon request by the beneficiary so long as all performance criteria have been met 
most guarantees extend up to one year 
at december  the maximum potential exposure amount of future payments is million

qualified collateral generally consists of residential first mortgage loans  us government and agency securities and funds on deposit at the fhlb 
at december   the banks have million in unused borrowing capacity that is contingent upon the purchase of additional fhlb stock 
use of this borrowing capacity may also be impacted by regulatory capital requirements

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on its performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the chief market risk factor affecting the financial condition and operating results of the company is interest rate risk 
this risk is managed by periodic evaluation of the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determination of the level of risk considered appropriate given capital and liquidity requirements  business strategy  performance objectives and operating environment and maintenance of such risks within guidelines approved by the board of directors 
through such management  the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of net earnings to changes in interest rates 
the banks asset liability committees  comprised of senior management  are responsible for managing interest rate risk and reviewing with their boards of directors on a quarterly basis their activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on operating results  the banks interest rate risk positions and the effect changes in interest rates would have on net interest income 
the extent of movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on earnings 
the principal strategies that the company uses to manage interest rate risk include i emphasizing the origination and retention of adjustable rate loans  origination of indirect auto loans compass only which have relatively short maturities and origination of loans with maturities at least partially matched with those of the deposits and borrowings funding the loans  ii investing in debt securities with relatively short maturities and iii classifying a significant portion of the investment portfolio as available for sale so as to provide sufficient flexibility in liquidity management 
the company and the banks quantify their interest rate risk exposure using a sophisticated simulation model 
simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specified time horizon 
simulation analysis involves projecting future interest income and expense under various rate scenarios 
internal guidelines on interest rate risk specify that for every basis points immediate shift in interest rates  estimated net interest income over the next twelve months should decline by no more than 
in utilizing a basis point increase in rates in its simulation model  the full impact of annual rate caps of basis points common to most adjustable rate mortgage loan products is considered 
the rate shocks used assume an instantaneous and parallel change in interest rates and that no strategies are implemented in response to the change in rates 
prepayment speeds for loans are based on published median dealer forecasts for each interest rate scenario 
the following table reflects the estimated percentage exposure of the company s net interest income for the months following the date indicated assuming an immediate shift in interest rates as set forth below december  basis points increase in rates basis points decrease in rates n m n m basis points decrease in rates n m n m basis points decrease in rates n m n m n m not meaningful due to the low interest rate environment in effect at december  and the average federal fund overnight rates were trading below  the simulation model could only be rate shocked down basis points and basis points  respectively 
the results above are dependent on material assumptions such as i changes in the composition and prepayments speeds of mortgage assets and loans ii the shape of the us government securities and interest rate swap yield curve iii the level of us prime interest rates and iv the level of rates paid on deposit accounts 
asymmetrical rate movements could also have a material impact on simulation results
