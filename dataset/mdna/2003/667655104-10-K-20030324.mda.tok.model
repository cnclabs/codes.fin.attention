item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following is management s assessment of northwest natural gas company s financial condition including the principal factors that affect results of operations 
the discussion refers to the consolidated activities of the company for the three years ended dec 
 references in this discussion to notes are to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements include regulated utility northwest natural gas company nw natural non regulated wholly owned subsidiary businesses nng financial corporation financial corporation  and its wholly owned subsidiaries northwest energy corporation northwest energy  and its wholly owned subsidiary non regulated majority owned subsidiary business canor energy ltd 
canor  sold in together these businesses are referred to herein as the company see non utility operations  below  and note 
highlights among its accomplishments in  the company o grew the utility customer base by more than percent for the th year in a row  adding  customers to nw natural s gas distribution system during the year  o exceeded the prior year s customer additions from residential and commercial conversions and residential new construction  despite weaker economic conditions  o reduced rates for nw natural s customers in oregon and washington due to lower purchased gas costs  and refunded million to customers from its savings on gas purchases in the past year  o expanded service in the interstate market for gas storage services  increasing earnings from this business segment from cents a share in to cents a share in  o received approval from the oregon public utility commission opuc for rate adjustments and a partial decoupling mechanism that will help stabilize margin revenues while better aligning nw natural s financial interests with customers interests in conserving energy  o tested and successfully qualified  under a federally mandated operator qualification rule  all nw natural employees who work on natural gas pipelines  o elected to terminate the october contract to acquire portland general electric company pge in light of the risks associated with the bankruptcy of pge s parent company  enron corp 
enron  and o paid dividends on common stock of a share  making the th consecutive year in which the company s dividend payments have increased 
issues and challenges issues and challenges the company expects to face in  as discussed below  include the effects and uncertainties relating to a general rate case in oregon  volatile gas commodity prices  unusually warm temperatures in the winter of  continuing weak economic conditions in oregon and washington  higher costs for pensions  health benefits and insurance  uncertainties relating to the permits and rights of way necessary for the planned extension of the pipeline from nw natural s mist gas storage field  and higher capital and maintenance costs due to federal mandates in the area of pipeline integrity 
earnings and dividends the company s earnings applicable to common stock in were million  down from million in both and earnings for were reduced by a loss provision of million after tax  representing the company s costs incurred in its effort to acquire pge from enron 
diluted earnings per share from consolidated operations were a share in  down from a share in both and excluding the charges relating to the acquisition effort  diluted earnings per share from consolidated operations in would have been a share 
earnings for and were the highest and second highest on record for the company 
earnings in included a gain of cents a share from the sale of canor 
nw natural earned a diluted share from gas utility operations in  the same as the result from utility operations in  compared to a share in weather conditions in its service territory in were very close to average for the year as a whole but were percent warmer than temperatures in were percent warmer than and percent colder than the year average 
weather in was percent colder than the year average 
results in from the company s non utility operations were a loss of cents a share  including earnings of cents a share from gas storage operations  charges equivalent to cents a share relating to the effort to purchase pge  and earnings of cents a share from other subsidiary and non utility operations 
the charges relating to the pge transaction resulted from the termination effective july  of the company s contract to purchase pge 
non utility operating results for were earnings of cents a share  including cents a share from gas storage operations 
non utility operating results for were earnings of cents a share  including a gain of cents a share from the sale of canor see non utility operations  below 
dividends paid on common stock were a share in compared to a share in and a share in application of critical accounting policies in preparing the company s financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles  including making estimates and assumptions 
management considers its critical accounting policies to be those which are most important to the representation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and which require management s most difficult and subjective or complex judgments  including those that could result in materially different amounts if the company reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company s critical accounting policies are described below 
other significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements are discussed in note regulatory accounting nw natural generally uses the same accounting policies and practices used by unregulated companies for financial reporting under gaap 
however  sometimes these principles  such as statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  require different accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effects of regulation 
for example  in setting nw natural s retail rates  the opuc may not allow nw natural to charge its customers currently to recover certain expenses  but instead may require that these expenses be charged to customers in the future 
in this situation  sfas no 
requires nw natural to defer these items and show them as regulatory assets on the balance sheet until nw natural is allowed to charge its customers 
nw natural then amortizes these items as expense to the income statement as the charges are recovered from customers 
similarly  certain revenue items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities  which are also eventually amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are reduced 
the conditions a regulated company must satisfy to apply the accounting policies and practices of sfas no 
include o an independent regulator sets rates  o the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and o the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
nw natural applies sfas no 
in accounting for its regulated operations 
the company periodically assesses whether it can continue to apply sfas no 
if nw natural should determine in the future that all or a portion of its regulatory assets and liabilities no longer meet the criteria for continued application of sfas no 
 then it would be required to write off the net unrecoverable balances of its regulatory assets and liabilities as a charge to income 
revenue recognition utility revenues are derived primarily from the sale and transportation of natural gas 
utility revenue from gas sales and transportation is recognized when the gas is delivered to and received by the customer 
estimated revenues are accrued for gas deliveries not billed to customers from meter reading dates to month end unbilled revenue and are reversed the following month when actual billings occur 
revenues from non utility services  including gas storage  are recognized upon delivery of the service to customers 
revenues from non utility optimization contracts are recognized  after deducting for regulatory revenue sharing  over the life of the contract for amounts guaranteed under the contract  or as amounts are earned and reasonably estimable for amounts above the guaranteed value 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  on jan 
 this statement established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that an entity recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
sfas no 
also requires that changes in the fair value of a derivative be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
nw natural s derivatives policy sets forth the guidelines for using selected financial derivative products to support prudent risk management strategies within designated parameters see note 
nw natural s primary hedging activities  consisting of natural gas commodity price and foreign currency exchange rate hedges  are principally accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
and subject to regulatory deferral pursuant to sfas no 
unrealized gains and losses from mark to market valuations of these contracts are not recognized in current income but are reported as non trading derivative assets or liabilities and offset by a corresponding deferred account balance included under regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets 
at dec 
  nw natural had derivatives outstanding covering its exposures to commodity and foreign currency prices see note 
the fair value of the hedge derivatives outstanding on that date was a net gain of million  compared to a net loss of million at dec 
 nw natural had two natural gas price swap contracts extending beyond dec 
  but none extends beyond oct 
 none of the natural gas call option contracts extends beyond march  in  nw natural recorded net losses from commodity swap and call option contracts of million  compared to net gains of million and million during and  respectively 
gains losses from commodity hedges are recorded as reductions increases to the cost of gas and are included in the calculation of annual purchased gas adjustment pga rate changes 
the gain or loss on all foreign currency forward purchase contracts relating to gas purchase obligations is included in nw natural s cost of gas 
the fair value of derivative instruments at dec 
 and was determined using estimated or quoted market prices for the periods covered by the contracts 
market prices for the natural gas swap and call option contracts were obtained from external sources 
these third party valuations are reviewed for reasonableness by the company using fair value calculations for other contracts with similar terms and conditions 
the market prices for the foreign currency forward contracts are based on currency exchange rates quoted by the bank of canada 
accounting for pensions nw natural has two qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plans that cover all regular employees with more than one year of service 
these plans are funded through a trust dedicated to providing the benefits 
net periodic pension costs are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions see financial condition pension cost income and funding status  below 
nw natural s pension cost consists of service costs  interest costs  the amortization of actuarial gains and losses  and expected long term returns on plan assets  and is based in part on a market related valuation of assets 
variances between actual investment gains or losses and expected returns on plan assets are recognized over a three year period from the year in which they occur  thereby reducing year to year volatility 
nw natural s accumulated benefit obligation  the fair value of plan assets and the amount of annual pension cost are calculated based on a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected long term return on plan assets  assumed rates of compensation increase and a discount rate see note 
in developing these assumptions  nw natural evaluates input from its actuaries as well as information available from the securities markets 
the actuarial assumptions are evaluated annually and adjusted as necessary 
based on information from its actuaries and investment advisors  nw natural reduced its expected long term return on plan assets from percent to percent  and reduced the discount rate used in calculating benefit obligations from percent to percent  both effective as of jan 
 had these assumptions been in effect a year earlier  nw natural would have recorded net periodic pension cost of million for the year  rather than pension income of million  and the company s net income would have been lower by million 
contingencies the company records loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of uncertainties that often depend upon judgments about potential actions by third parties 
in the normal course of business  nw natural records accruals for loss contingencies including allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  environmental claims and property damage and personal injury claims 
nw natural records receivables for anticipated recoveries under insurance contracts when recovery is probable 
results of operations regulatory matters nw natural provides gas utility service in oregon and washington  with oregon representing over percent of its revenues 
future earnings and cash flows from utility operations will be determined largely by the pace of continued growth in the residential and commercial markets and by the ability to remain price competitive in the large industrial market  to control expenses  and to obtain reasonable and timely regulatory ratemaking treatment for investments made in utility plant 
nw natural s most recent general rate increase in oregon  which was effective dec 
  authorized rates designed to produce a return on common shareholders equity roe of percent 
the opuc approved a revenue increase of million per year  or percent of oregon revenues 
on nov 
  nw natural filed a new general rate case in oregon 
the filing proposes a revenue increase of million per year from oregon operations through rate increases averaging percent 
if the increase were approved as proposed  residential customer rates would increase by percent and commercial rates by percent  there would be no changes for industrial firm or interruptible customer rates 
the proposed rates are designed to produce an roe of percent and to recover increases in nw natural s cost of service including the costs of complying with new federal regulations regarding pipeline safety and integrity  expanding the company s underground storage facilities to meet customer growth  commencing service to coos county  oregon  improving customer service  and providing for system security  insurance coverage and employee benefits 
the schedule for the case provides for settlement conferences in march  the filing of opuc staff and intervenor testimony in late april  hearings in august and a decision by the opuc determining new rates by oct 
the company is unable to determine the extent to which its proposals will be accepted by the opuc 
in october  the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc authorized a general rate increase totaling million per year  or percent 
the first million per year of the revenue increase  relating to costs allocated to washington under a cost allocation study approved by the wutc and the opuc  was effective on nov 
 the remaining increase of million per year was effective on oct 
 the wutc authorized and based rates on an roe of percent 
nw natural applies rate changes each year under the pga mechanisms in its tariffs in oregon and washington 
the rate increases or decreases reflect changes in the costs of natural gas commodity purchased under contracts with gas producers see comparison of gas operations cost of gas  below  the application of temporary rate adjustments to amortize balances in regulatory asset or liability accounts and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective the previous year 
in  the opuc approved rate decreases averaging percent for nw natural s oregon sales customers and the wutc approved rate decreases averaging percent for nw natural s washington sales customers  both effective on oct 
 in  the opuc approved rate increases averaging percent for oregon sales customers and the wutc approved rate increases averaging percent for washington sales customers  both effective on oct 
 in  the opuc approved rate increases averaging percent for oregon sales customers effective on oct 
 and the wutc approved rate increases averaging percent for washington sales customers effective on aug 
 in an order issued in  the opuc formalized a process that tests for excessive earnings in connection with gas utilities annual filings under their pga mechanisms 
the opuc confirmed nw natural s ability to pass through percent of its prudently incurred gas costs into rates 
under this order  nw natural is authorized to retain all of its earnings up to a threshold level equal to its authorized roe plus basis points 
one third of any earnings above that level will be refunded to customers 
the excess earnings threshold is subject to adjustment up or down each year depending on movements in interest rates 
there were no amounts identified in this process for refund to customers with respect to nw natural s earnings results in or nw natural does not expect there will be amounts identified for refund with respect to its earnings in  which will be reviewed by the opuc in the second quarter of in  the opuc approved a settlement in a proceeding nw natural initiated in with a goal of stabilizing margin revenues in the face of above or below normal consumption patterns 
nw natural believes that reductions in recent years in its customers gas consumptions per degree day see comparison of gas operations residential and commercial  below were caused by increases in the cost of purchased gas that were passed on to customers as rate increases  and to efforts throughout the region to conserve energy 
nw natural estimates that lower average consumptions per degree day reduced margin from residential and commercial sales by million  equivalent to cents a share  in  and by million  equivalent to cents a share  in the first nine months of pursuant to the settlement  the opuc authorized a mechanism for rate changes relating to the impact of price elasticity  starting with small increases to residential and commercial rates that became effective on oct 
 these rate changes contributed an estimated million of margin during the fourth quarter of  equivalent to cents a share 
also under the settlement  the opuc authorized nw natural to implement a partial decoupling mechanism effective oct 
 decoupling mechanisms are used to break the link between a utility s earnings and the energy consumed by its customers so the utility does not have an incentive to discourage customers conservation efforts 
the decoupling mechanism works by adding margin revenues during periods when customer consumptions are lower than baseline consumption or by deducting margin revenues when consumptions are higher than the baseline 
under the partial decoupling mechanism  nw natural uses a balancing account to defer and subsequently amortize percent of the margin differentials between baseline usage by its residential and commercial customers and weather normalized actual usage by these customers 
the deferred amounts are treated as adjustments to be refunded or collected in future periods 
baseline consumption is based on current customer consumption patterns  adjusted for consumptions resulting from new customers 
nw natural continues to bear the risk of weather related variations in customer usage 
the partial decoupling mechanism will expire at the end of september unless the opuc approves an extension based on the results of an independent study to measure the mechanism s effectiveness 
also under the settlement  nw natural agreed to adopt certain service quality measures that establish the company s performance goal for minimizing complaints by customers where the company is determined to be at fault 
if nw natural exceeds the prescribed level of at fault complaints  it will be subject to penalties 
comparison of gas operations the following table summarizes the composition of gas utility volumes and revenues for the three years ended dec 
thousands  except customers and degree days utility gas sales and transportation volumes therms residential and commercial sales    unbilled volumes    weather sensitive volumes    industrial firm sales    industrial interruptible sales    total gas sales    transportation deliveries    total volumes sold and delivered    utility operating revenues dollars residential and commercial sales    unbilled revenues    weather sensitive revenues    industrial firm sales    industrial interruptible sales    total gas sales    transportation revenues    other revenues    total utility operating revenues    cost of gas sold    net operating revenues utility margin    total number of customers end of period    actual degree days    year average degree days    nw natural refunded deferred gas cost savings to its oregon customers through billing credits in june the refunds were the customers percent portion of gas cost savings realized between october and march  which had been deferred  with interest  pursuant to nw natural s pga tariff in oregon see cost of gas  below 
the refunds reduced total gas sales and total utility operating revenues for by million and cost of gas sold by million 
the refunds also reduced utility margin by about million  but this amount was largely offset by corresponding reductions in franchise tax expense and uncollectible expense with the result that the effect of the refunds on net income was negligible 
residential and commercial nw natural continued to grow its customer base  with  customers added during this represents a growth rate of percent  compared to percent in and percent in in the three years ended dec 
  more than  customers were added to the system  representing an average annual growth rate of percent 
typically  percent or more of nw natural s annual operating revenues are derived from gas sales to weather sensitive residential and commercial customers 
accordingly  variations in temperatures between periods affect volumes of gas sold to these customers 
weather conditions in were very close to average for the year 
temperatures were percent colder than average in and percent colder than average in weather in was percent warmer than and was percent warmer than average weather conditions are calculated from the most recent years of temperature data measured by heating degree days 
the volumes of gas sold to residential and commercial customers were percent lower in than in and percent lower in than in  reflecting warmer weather as well as lower consumption patterns by customers due to higher gas commodity prices included in rates in previous years 
effective oct 
  the company implemented rate increases designed to recover the margin lost due to the changes in consumption patterns 
excluding the impact of the refunds to oregon customers during  related revenues increased million  or percent  primarily due to pga tariff rate increases effective oct 
 see regulatory matters  above 
revenue from residential and commercial customers was percent higher in than in due to rate increases effective in and in order to match revenues with related purchased gas costs  nw natural records unbilled revenues for gas delivered and sold to customers  but not yet billed  through the end of the period 
amounts reported as unbilled revenues reflect the increase or decrease in the balance of unbilled revenues over the prior year end 
weather conditions  rate changes and customer billing dates from one period to the next affect year end balances 
industrial sales  transportation and other revenues the following table summarizes the delivered volumes and margin by market segment in the industrial market thousands delivered volumes by market segment therms electric generation    industrial sales and transportation    total volumes    margin by market segment dollars electric generation   industrial sales and transportation    total margin    total volumes delivered to industrial and electric generation customers were percent higher in than in and percent lower in than in combined margins from these customers were percent lower in than in and percent higher in than in excluding electric generation customers  volumes delivered to end use industrial sales and transportation customers were percent higher in than in and percent lower in than in margin from these customers was percent lower in than in and percent lower in than in the decline in margin from these customers was due to migrations of some industrial customers from higher margin firm service to lower margin interruptible service and to plant shut downs or cut backs in the manufacturing sector because of economic conditions 
in the electric generation market segment  margin was million and million in and  respectively  equivalent to cents a share in each year 
more than percent of the margin but only about percent of the gas deliveries in each of these years was from two customers that were served under contracts that went into effect in the second half of and expired at the end of the second quarter of most of the margin from these contracts was from fixed charges 
a third electric generation customer used million therms in  million therms in and million therms in under contracts with low volumetric charges 
margin in the electric generation market segment in was negligible 
other revenues include amortizations of regulatory accounts and miscellaneous fee income 
in  other revenues increased net utility operating revenues by million 
other revenues in included customer late payment and collection fees million  amortizations of regulatory accounts covering customer consumption under nw natural s decoupling mechanism million see regulatory matters  above  miscellaneous revenues million and refunds due to sharing of income from interstate gas storage services million  partially offset by amortizations from regulatory accounts covering conservation programs million and year costs million 
in  other revenues reduced net utility operating revenues by million 
other revenues in included expense amortizations of regulatory accounts covering conservation programs million  year costs million and property taxes million  partially offset by revenues from customer late payment and collection fees million and miscellaneous revenues million 
cost of gas the cost per therm of gas sold was percent higher in than in and percent higher in than in the cost per therm of gas sold includes current gas purchases  gas drawn from storage inventory  gains or losses from commodity hedges  margin from off system gas sales  demand cost equalization  regulatory deferrals and company use 
results for include an adjustment reducing cost of gas by million see comparison of gas operations  above 
excluding the impact of this adjustment  the cost per therm of gas sold was percent higher in than in  primarily due to higher prices in the natural gas commodity market 
results for also include adjustments reducing cost of gas by million to correct the amount of deferred expenses related to the recovery of pipeline demand charges under nw natural s oregon pga mechanism 
these adjustments contributed cents a share to earnings during the corrected methodology will continue to be applied in the future 
nw natural uses a natural gas commodity price hedge program under the terms of its derivatives policy see note to help manage its variable price gas commodity contracts 
nw natural recorded net losses from commodity swap and call option contracts of million during  compared to net gains of million and million in and  respectively 
gains losses from commodity hedges are recorded as reductions increases to the cost of gas and the majority of such gains and losses are included in annual pga rate adjustments 
under nw natural s pga tariff in oregon  net income from oregon operations is affected within defined limits by changes in purchased gas costs 
nw natural absorbs percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retains percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to projected costs built into rates 
the remaining percent of the higher or lower gas costs is recorded as deferred debits or credits regulatory assets or liabilities for recovery from or refund to customers in future rates 
net savings realized from gas commodity purchases in contributed million of margin  equivalent to cents a share of earnings 
net savings realized from gas purchases in totaled million  of which million was deferred for refund to customers and million was reflected as an increase in margin 
these gas cost savings contributed cents a share to earnings in  while excess gas costs in reduced earnings by cents a share 
under an agreement with the opuc  margin from off system gas sales is treated as a reduction of gas costs 
these sales reduced the cost of gas sold by million in  million in and million in natural gas commodity prices have fluctuated dramatically in recent years 
nw natural has sought to mitigate the effect of price volatility on core utility customers through the use of its underground storage facilities  by entering into gas commodity based financial hedge contracts  and by crediting gas costs with margin revenues derived from off system sales of commodity and released transportation capacity in periods when core utility customers do not fully utilize firm pipeline capacity and gas supplies 
non utility operations at dec 
 and  the company s non utility operations consisted of two direct wholly owned subsidiaries  financial corporation and northwest energy  and gas storage operations 
one discontinued segment  canor  a majority owned subsidiary  was sold in see discontinued segment  below 
financial corporation financial corporation s operating results in were net income of million  compared to million in and million in the increases in net income from to  and from to  were due to improved operating results from financial corporation s investments in limited partnerships in wind and solar electric generation projects in california 
the company s investment in financial corporation at dec 
  was million  compared to million and million at dec 
 and  respectively 
northwest energy northwest energy was formed in to serve as the holding company for nw natural and pge if the acquisition of pge had been completed 
northwest energy recorded a loss provision totaling million before tax in for the transaction costs incurred in connection with the effort to acquire pge 
these charges  equivalent to cents a diluted share  were based upon the company s judgment that the acquisition was no longer probable 
discontinued segment during  the company sold its interest in canor at a gain of million  equivalent to cents a share see note 
gas storage nw natural realized net income from its non utility gas storage business segment in  after regulatory sharing and income taxes  of million or cents a share  up from million or cents a share in and million or negligible earnings per share in gas storage services are provided to upstream interstate customers using storage capacity that has been developed in advance of core utility customers requirements 
nw natural retains percent of the income before tax from gas storage services and credits the remaining percent to a deferred regulatory account for sharing with its core utility customers 
results for the gas storage business segment also include revenues  net of amounts shared with core utility customers  from a contract with an independent energy trading company that seeks to optimize the use of nw natural s assets by trading temporarily unused portions of its gas storage capacity and upstream pipeline transportation capacity 
operating expenses operations and maintenance consolidated operations and maintenance expenses were million  or percent  higher in than in the increase was caused primarily by higher payroll costs due to wage and salary increases million and higher expenses for pension million see financial condition pension cost income and funding status  below and health benefits million  partially offset by an amount charged to a litigation reserve in million  lower information technology expenses million and lower uncollectible accounts expense million 
consolidated operations and maintenance expenses were million  or percent  higher in than in the increase resulted primarily from higher payroll costs due to wage and salary increases million  higher costs for employees health and pension benefits million  a charge to a litigation reserve resulting from an unfavorable decision by the oregon supreme court in a case involving a claim by a commercial customer million and higher uncollectible accounts expense million 
taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes  which are principally comprised of property  franchise and payroll taxes  increased million  or percent  in property taxes increased million  or percent  due to higher property tax rates and utility plant additions 
franchise taxes  regulatory fees and payroll tax expenses accounted for the remaining million increase in taxes other than income taxes increased million  or percent  in property taxes increased million  or percent  due to higher property tax rates and utility plant additions 
franchise taxes  which are based on gross revenues  increased million  or percent  reflecting higher revenues due to nw natural s growing customer base and rate increases effective in late and regulatory fees and payroll tax expenses accounted for the remaining million increase in depreciation and amortization the company s depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in and by million in  or about percent in each of these years  primarily due to corresponding increases in utility plant and non utility plant in service 
depreciation and amortization expense was million or about percent lower in than in  primarily due to charges to depreciation expense in to write down nw natural s customer information system pursuant to the opuc s order in its oregon general rate case concluded in as a percentage of average plant and property  depreciation and amortization expense was percent in each of  and other income expense the company s other income expense decreased million in  primarily due to a million charge to a loss provision for costs incurred in the effort to acquire pge 
excluding the provision for pge acquisition costs  other income expense decreased million  primarily due to higher interest accrued on deferred regulatory account balances million  an increase in miscellaneous non operating expenses million and a decrease in miscellaneous non operating income million  partially offset by an increase in earnings from investments million 
other income in was million  or million lower than in  primarily due to lower interest income accrued on deferred regulatory account balances million and lower miscellaneous non operating income million 
interest charges net the company s net interest expense in was million  or percent  higher than in  primarily due to higher average balances of long term debt outstanding 
net interest expense in was million higher than in excluding a million charge to interest expense due to an unfavorable litigation decision  interest expense decreased million in due to lower average interest rates 
allowance for funds used during construction afudc represents the cost of funds used during the construction of utility plant see note 
in  afudc reduced interest expense by million compared to million in and million in afudc was calculated using weighted average rates of percent in  percent in and percent in see financial condition cash flows financing activities  below 
income taxes the effective income tax rate of percent in includes the effect of the tax benefit from the million charge for costs incurred in the effort to acquire pge 
absent this charge  the effective tax rate for would have been percent  compared to percent for and percent for see note 
redeemable preferred and preference stock dividend requirements redeemable preferred and preference stock dividend requirements for  and were lower by million in each year compared to the prior year due to annual sinking fund redemptions 
on dec 
  nw natural redeemed in its entirety the series of redeemable preference stock pursuant to the mandatory redemption provisions applicable to that series 
financial condition capital structure the company s goal is to maintain a capital structure comprised of to percent common stock equity  up to percent preferred stock and to percent short term and long term debt 
when additional capital is required  debt or equity securities are issued depending upon both the target capital structure and market conditions 
these sources also are used to meet long term debt and preferred stock redemption requirements see notes and 
liquidity and capital resources at dec 
  the company had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at dec 
 short term liquidity is provided by cash from operations and from the sale of the company s commercial paper notes  which are supported by commercial bank lines of credit see note 
the company has available through sept 
  committed lines of credit with four commercial banks see lines of credit  below 
on dec 
  nw natural redeemed all  shares of its series of redeemable preference stock with proceeds from the sale of commercial paper 
the following table shows nw natural s contractual commitments by maturity and type of commitment thousands long term gas other payments due in years commercial preferred long term capital operating supply purchase ending dec 
 paper stock debt leases leases commitments commitments total total        thereafter      less imputed interest   total        nw natural s capital expenditures are primarily related to utility construction resulting from customer growth and system improvements see cash flows investing activities  below 
in addition  nw natural has certain long term contractual commitments under capital leases  operating leases and long term gas supply purchase contracts that require an adequate source of funding 
nw natural also has a contract commitment to purchase about million in gas transmission pipe in for use in constructing an extension of the pipeline from its mist storage field 
these capital and contractual expenditures are financed through cash from operations and from the issuance of short term debt  which is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
there are no credit rating triggers or stock price provisions that require the acceleration of debt repayment under nw natural s mortgage and deed of trust or other long term indebtedness 
also  there are no rating triggers or stock price provisions contained in contracts or other agreements with third parties  except for agreements with certain counter parties under nw natural s derivatives policy  which require the affected party to provide substitute collateral such as cash  guaranty or letter of credit if credit ratings are lowered to non investment grade  or in some cases if the mark to market value exceeds a certain threshold 
at dec 
  the company had three commodity price swap agreements outstanding with one counter party which was subject to a below investment grade ratings trigger 
the company has no other material off balance sheet obligations  except for certain lease and purchase commitments see table above and note 
commercial paper the company s primary source of short term funds is commercial paper notes payable 
both nw natural and financial corporation issue commercial paper under agency agreements with a commercial bank 
nw natural s commercial paper is supported by its committed bank lines of credit see lines of credit  below  while financial corporation s commercial paper is supported by committed bank lines of credit and the guaranty of nw natural see note 
nw natural had million of commercial paper notes outstanding at dec 
  compared to million at dec 
 financial corporation had no commercial paper notes outstanding at dec 
 or lines of credit nw natural has lines of credit with four commercial banks totaling million 
half of the credit with each bank  totaling million  is committed and available through sept 
  and the other million is committed and available through sept 
 in addition  financial corporation has available through sept 
  committed lines of credit with two commercial banks totaling million 
financial corporation s lines are supported by the guaranty of nw natural 
under the terms of these lines of credit  nw natural and financial corporation pay commitment fees but are not required to maintain compensating bank balances 
the interest rates on borrowings under these lines of credit  if any  are based on current market rates 
there were no outstanding balances under either nw natural s or financial corporation s lines of credit at dec 
 or nw natural s lines of credit require that credit ratings be maintained in effect at all times and that notice be given of any change in its senior unsecured debt ratings 
a change in nw natural s credit rating is not an event of default  nor is the maintenance of a specific minimum level of credit rating a condition to drawing upon the lines of credit 
however  interest rates on any loans outstanding under nw natural s bank lines are tied to credit ratings  which would increase or decrease the cost of bank debt  if any  when ratings are changed 
the lines of credit require the company to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of percent or less and to maintain a net worth at least equal to percent of its net worth at sept 
  plus percent of the company s net income for each subsequent fiscal quarter 
failure to comply with either of these covenants would entitle the banks to terminate their lending commitments and to accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding 
at dec 
  the company was in compliance with both of these covenants 
the banks have waived through sept 
  a requirement that nw natural represent that the assets dedicated to its qualified pension plans exceed the unfunded liabilities of the plans before it may draw upon the lines of credit 
nw natural may be unable to draw upon the two year portions of the credit lines  totaling million  until its notes relating to the two year commitments are approved by the opuc or the wutc  or both 
nw natural expects that it will be able to secure such approvals  if required 
cash flows operating activities continuing operations provided net cash of million in compared to million in the percent increase was due to increased cash from operations before working capital changes million and lower working capital requirements million 
the increase in cash from continuing operations before working capital changes was due to an increase in deferred income taxes and investment tax credits in compared to a reduction in million  the loss provision for the pge transaction costs million and higher depreciation and amortization million  largely offset by a small increase in deferred gas cost payables in compared to a large swing from net gas cost receivables to payables in million  and lower net income in million 
the decrease in working capital requirements was due to an increase in accounts payable in compared to a decrease in million  a decrease in accrued unbilled revenue in compared to an increase in million  and a decrease in accounts receivable in compared to an increase in million  partially offset by a decrease in accrued interest and taxes in compared to an increase in million and a larger increase in inventories in million 
nw natural s refunds to customers of approximately million of deferred gas cost savings in see results of operations comparison of gas operations  above reduced cash flows from operations by that amount  but the reduction was more than offset by the other factors affecting cash flows cited above 
the job creation and worker assistance act of the assistance act  enacted on march   allows an additional first year tax deduction for depreciation equal to percent of the adjusted basis of qualified property 
the extra percent depreciation deduction in the first year is an acceleration of depreciation deductions that otherwise would have been taken in the later years of an asset s recovery period 
in general  the extra percent depreciation deduction is available for most personal property acquired after sept 
  and before sept 
 the company anticipates enhanced cash flow from reduced income taxes  totaling an estimated million to million  during the effective period of the assistance act  based on actual and projected plant investments between sept 
 and sept

investments in non utility property in million and million included expenditures for certain improvements to the company s mist gas storage system that were primarily related to interstate storage services 
during the five year period through  utility construction expenditures are estimated at between million and million 
the level of capital expenditures over the next five years reflects projected customer growth  system improvement projects resulting in part from requirements under the pipeline safety act see below  and a project estimated to cost million to extend the pipeline that moves gas from nw natural s mist gas storage field into growing portions of its service area 
an estimated percent of the required funds are expected to be internally generated over the five year period  the remainder will be funded through a combination of long term debt and equity securities with short term debt providing liquidity and bridge financing 
nw natural s utility construction expenditures in are estimated to total million  up from million in projected utility construction in includes million for customer growth  up from million in  million for system improvement and support  up from million in  million for the extension of the mist pipeline and related gas storage projects  up from million in  and million for the construction of a gas distribution system in coos county  oregon  up from million in the project for the extension of the mist pipeline has a scheduled completion date in late or following two years of review of nw natural s application  including extensive public involvement  the oregon energy facility siting council granted a permit for the project  with conditions  on march  the issuance of this permit potentially could be appealed under current law 
nw natural also must obtain easements and rights of way for the construction of the pipeline and may need to use condemnation proceedings to secure some of them 
the company entered into a stipulation with the opuc in for an enhanced pipeline safety program that includes an accelerated bare steel replacement program and a geo hazard safety program 
the bare steel replacement program accelerates the replacement of the company s bare steel piping over years instead of years 
the geo hazard safety program includes the identification  assessment and remediation of risks to the company s piping infrastructure created by landslides  washouts  earthquakes or similar occurrences 
the stipulation allowed the company to receive deferred accounting rate treatment commencing oct 
  for costs associated with the programs  expected to be approximately million annually 
on nov 
  congress passed the pipeline safety improvement act of pipeline safety act and the legislation was signed into law by president bush on dec 
 the pipeline safety act requires operators of gas transmission pipelines to identify lines located in high consequence areas hcas and develop integrity management programs imps to periodically inspect the integrity of the pipelines and make repairs or replacements as necessary to ensure the ongoing integrity of the pipelines 
the legislation requires nw natural to complete inspection of the percent highest risk pipelines located in its hcas within the first five years  and the remaining covered pipelines within years of the date of the enactment 
the pipeline safety act also requires re inspections of the covered pipelines every seven years thereafter for the life of the pipelines 
on jan 
  the us department of transportation issued proposed rules that may impose additional requirements on pipeline operators that could result in shorter time periods for compliance and require additional capital investment by the company 
the cost of compliance with the legislation and rules is uncertain  however  nw natural s imp is expected to cost approximately million to million per year beginning in  and more than million over the next years

contingent liabilities environmental matters nw natural owns property in multnomah county  oregon that is the site of a former gas manufacturing plant that was closed in the gasco site 
the gasco site has been under investigation by nw natural for environmental contamination under the oregon department of environmental quality s odeq voluntary clean up program 
nw natural has recorded liabilities totaling million for the estimated costs of investigation and interim remediation at the gasco site  including consultants fees  odeq oversight reimbursement and legal fees  of which million had been spent as of dec 
nw natural previously owned property adjacent to the gasco site that now is the location of a manufacturing plant owned by wacker siltronic corporation the wacker site 
in  the odeq issued an order requiring wacker and nw natural to determine the nature and extent of releases of hazardous substances to willamette river sediments from the wacker site 
nw natural has completed the majority of the studies required under the odeq work plan and the agency is reviewing data generated by the studies 
nw natural has recorded a liability of million for its estimated costs of the investigation and initial remediation on the wacker site  of which million had been spent as of dec 
 in  the odeq and the us environmental protection agency epa completed a study of sediments in a mile segment of the willamette river the portland harbor that includes the area adjacent to the gasco site and the wacker site 
in  the epa listed the portland harbor as a superfund site and notified the company that it is a potentially responsible party 
nw natural recorded liabilities totaling million between and  of which million had been spent as of dec 
 the amount of nw natural s liability is based on estimates of the company s share of the lower end of a range of probable liability for the costs of the remedial investigation feasibility study for the portland harbor 
available information is insufficient to determine either the total amount of liability for investigation and remediation of the portland harbor or the higher end of a range for nw natural s estimated share of that liability 
the city of portland has notified nw natural that it is planning a sewer improvement project that would include excavation within the former site of a gas manufacturing plant the portland gas site that was owned and operated by a predecessor of the company between and the preliminary assessment of this site performed by a consultant for the epa in indicated that it could be assumed that by product tars may have been disposed of on site 
the report concluded  however  that it is likely that waste residues from the plant  if present on the site  were covered by deep fill during construction of the nearby seawall bordering the willamette river and probably have stabilized due to physical and chemical processes 
neither the city of portland nor the odeq has notified nw natural whether a further investigation or potential remediation might be required on the site in connection with the sewer project 
available information is insufficient to determine either the total amount of liability or a probable range  if any  of potential liability 
nw natural has accrued all material loss contingencies relating to environmental matters that it believes to be probable of assertion and reasonably estimable 
due to the preliminary nature of these environmental investigations  the range of any additional possible loss contingency cannot be currently estimated 
nw natural expects that its costs of further investigation and remediation for which it may be responsible with respect to the gasco site  the wacker site  the portland harbor site and the portland gas site  if any  should be recoverable  in large part  from insurance 
at dec 
  nw natural had a million receivable representing an estimate of the environmental costs nw natural expects to recover from insurance  including million that was recorded in for costs relating to the gasco site and million that was recorded in for costs relating to the portland harbor site 
in the event these costs are not recovered from insurance  nw natural will seek recovery through future rates

physical and financial commodity  foreign currency and interest rate transactions nw natural enters into short term and long term natural gas purchase contracts with demand and commodity fixed price and floating price components  along with associated short term and long term natural gas transportation contracts 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge against foreign exchange rate fluctuations on purchases made under these contracts that are denominated in canadian dollars 
historically  nw natural has taken physical delivery of at least the minimum quantities specified in its natural gas purchase contracts 
the contracts are subject to annual re pricing  a process that is intended to reflect anticipated market price trends during the next year 
nw natural s pga mechanism in oregon provides for the recovery from customers of actual commodity costs in comparison with established benchmark costs  except that nw natural absorbs percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retains percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to projections 
at dec 
  differences between notional values and fair values with respect to nw natural s open positions in derivative financial instruments were not material to the company s financial position or results of operations because of the treatment of these instruments in regulatory mechanisms relating to gas costs see results of operations comparison of gas operations cost of gas  above  and notes and 
however  to the degree that market risks exist due to potential adverse changes in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates in relation to these financial and physical contracts  the company considers the risks to be commodity price risk the prices of natural gas commodity are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  pipeline transportation congestion and other factors that affect short term supply and demand 
natural gas commodity swaps and call option contracts are used to convert certain long term gas purchase contracts from floating prices to fixed prices 
at dec 
 and  notional amounts under natural gas commodity swaps and call option contracts totaled million and million  respectively
