item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s worldwide operations are primarily driven by the number of oil and natural gas wells being drilled  the depth and drilling conditions of such wells  the number of well completions and the level of workover activity 
drilling activity  in turn  is largely dependent on the price of crude oil and natural gas 
this situation often leads to volatility in the company s revenue and profitability  especially in the united states and canada  where the company historically has generated in excess of of its revenue 
for the twelve months ended september   the active us rig count averaged rigs  an increase from fiscal for the twelve months ended september   the active us rig count averaged rigs  a decrease from fiscal much of the decrease occurred in the number of rigs drilling for natural gas  which for fiscal decreased from the previous fiscal year 
the company s management believes that the average us rig count for fiscal will be approximately higher than fiscal  essentially flat with current levels of approximately  rigs 
drilling activity outside north america has historically been less volatile than drilling activity in the us and canada 
active international drilling rigs excluding canada averaged rigs during fiscal  an increase of from fiscal during  active international drilling rigs excluding canada averaged rigs  a decrease of from fiscal in canada  drilling activity averaged rigs during fiscal  an increase of from fiscal canadian drilling activity declined in fiscal averaging active drilling rigs  down from the previous fiscal year 
the company expects international drilling activity outside of canada to remain relatively flat for fiscal compared to fiscal drilling activity in canada is expected to increase approximately for fiscal over fiscal critical accounting policies in may  the sec issued a proposed rule disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about the application of critical accounting policies 
although the sec has not issued a final rule  the following discussion has been prepared on the basis of the guidelines in the sec rule proposal 
the proposed rule would require disclosures of critical accounting estimates 
for an accounting policy to be deemed critical  the accounting policy must first include an estimate that requires a company to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made 
second  different estimates that the company reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  must have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as the company s operating environment changes 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known  including estimates not deemed critical under the proposed rule by the sec 
the company believes the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies 
the selection of accounting estimates  including those deemed critical  and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with the disclosures elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill effective october   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings 
sfas requires goodwill to be reviewed for possible impairment using fair value 
table of contents measurement techniques on an annual basis  or if circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its net book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the net book value  no impairment is required and the second step is unnecessary 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the net book value  the second step is performed to determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
fair value measures include quoted market price  present value technique estimate of future cash flows  and a valuation technique based on multiples of earnings or revenue 
the second step compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit with the net book value of the reporting unit 
if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in the amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had just been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
determining fair value and the implied fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of the impairment charge 
the company s estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows 
this approach uses significant assumptions such as a discount rate  growth rate  rig count  company price book increases or decreases  and inflation rate 
during the first fiscal quarter of  the company performed a transitional fair value based impairment test utilizing discounted estimated cash flows to evaluate any possible impairment of goodwill  and determined that fair value exceeded the net book value at october   therefore no impairment loss has been recorded 
no impairment adjustment was necessary to the company s million goodwill balance at september  see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on goodwill and segments 
pension plans pension expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
in accordance with sfas  the company utilizes an estimated long term rate of return on plan assets and any difference from the actual return is the unrecognized gain loss which is amortized into earnings in future periods 
the company determines the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis using a third party actuary 
in determining the annual estimate of net periodic pension cost  the company is required to make an evaluation of critical assumptions such as discount rate  expected long term rate of return and expected increase in compensation levels 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
discount rates are based on high quality corporate fixed income investments 
long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of the company s asset allocation and returns being earned by similar investments 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon our historical salary experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in future periods 
as with many companies  during  actual asset returns for the company s pension assets were adversely impacted by the continued deterioration of the equity markets and declining interest rates 
the negative asset returns and declining discount rates unfavorably affected the company s funded status 
as a result  in calendar year  the company will have a minimum pension funding requirement of million 
we expect to fund this amount with cash flows from operating activities 
in accordance with sfas  the company s balance in other noncurrent liabilities for the us minimum pension liability adjustments was million and million as of september  and  respectively 
the company s balance in other noncurrent liabilities for the foreign minimum pension liability adjustments was million and million as of september  and  respectively 
as there were no previously unrecognized prior service costs at 
table of contents september  and  the full amount of the adjustments  net of related deferred tax benefit  are reflected within accumulated other comprehensive income as a reduction of stockholders equity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s pension plans 
income taxes the effective income tax rates were   and for the years ended september    and  respectively 
these rates vary primarily due to fluctuations in taxes from the mix of domestic versus foreign income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the net assets of the company 
in providing for deferred taxes  management considers current tax laws  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
this process also involves making forecasts of current and future years united states taxable income 
unforeseen events and industry conditions may impact these forecasts which in turn can affect the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and impact our future reported earnings 
self insurance accruals and loss contingencies the company is self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  general liability  property damage and employee medical benefits for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
management reviews the liability on a quarterly basis 
the liability is estimated on an undiscounted basis using individual case based valuations and statistical analysis and is based upon judgment and historical experience  however  the final cost of many of these claims may not be known for five years or longer 
this estimate is subject to trends  such as loss development factors  historical average claim volume  average cost for settled claims and current trends in claim costs 
significant and unanticipated changes in these trends or future actual payouts could result in additional increases or decreases to the recorded accruals 
we have purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit  to the extent feasible  our aggregate exposure to certain claims 
there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the company against liability from all potential consequences 
at september  and september   self insurance accruals totaled million and million  respectively 
as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against the company 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against the company and litigation is subject to many uncertainties 
it is possible that there could be adverse developments in these cases 
the company records provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss  our results of operations may be over or understated 
acquisitions on may   the company completed the acquisition of osca  a completion services pressure pumping  completion tools and completion fluids company based in lafayette  louisiana  with operations primarily in the us gulf of mexico  brazil and venezuela for a total purchase price of million 
on june   the company completed a million acquisition of the coiled tubing assets and business of maritima petroleo e engenharia  ltda maritima  a leading provider of coiled tubing services in brazil

see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue and operating income for year ended september   consolidated revenue increased  compared to the same period last year with us mexico pressure pumping services revenue increasing and international pressure pumping services revenue increasing 
revenue from other oilfield services was up due primarily to the addition of the completion fluids and completion tools service lines acquired with osca in may for the year ended september   consolidated revenue decreased  compared to year ended september  with us mexico pressure pumping services revenue decreasing and international pressure pumping services decreasing 
revenue from other oilfield services was up due primarily to the addition of the completion fluids and completion tools service lines acquired with osca in may for the year ended september   operating income margins decreased to from reported for the year ended september   due primarily to lower us pricing  which was partially offset by increased canadian activity 
for the year ended september   operating income margins declined to from reported for the year ended september   due primarily to activity and pricing declines in the us and canadian markets 
see discussion below on individual segments for further revenue and operating income variance details 
depreciation expense for the year ended september   depreciation expense increased by million  compared to the year ended september  this is primarily a result of the company s capital spending levels and additional depreciation expense on certain capital improvements on leased equipment 
for the year ended september   depreciation expense was consistent with the year ended september

for fiscal compared to fiscal  these expenses in total increased million primarily as a result of the acquisition of osca 
other expenses interest expense increased million for the year ended september   compared to the year ended september  this is a result of the issuance of convertible debt in april  used to finance a portion of the osca acquisition 
interest expense decreased million for the year ended september   compared to the year ended september  as a result of lower average debt levels in fiscal interest income increased million for the year ended september   compared to the year ended september  this is a result of an increased cash and cash equivalents balance 
interest income in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal this income is derived from investing excess cash from operating activities

results for fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or compared to fiscal revenue increased due primarily to an increase in us drilling activity and increased market share  partially offset by lower us prices in fiscal compared to fiscal operating income for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or from fiscal operating income increased as a result of activity increases  market share increases  and labor and equipment efficiencies 
these increases were mostly offset by a deterioration in prices received by the company for pressure pumping services compared to fiscal the decline resulting from our prices for pumping services occurred primarily in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents results for fiscal compared to fiscal revenue was million  a decrease of million  or compared to fiscal the decline was primarily due to decreased drilling and workover activity which declined  compared to fiscal in addition  prices for the company s pressure pumping services in the us market weakened in fiscal operating income was million  a decrease of million  or compared to fiscal the decrease was due primarily to decreased revenue resulting from the decline in drilling and workover activity  along with the corresponding decline in prices for the company s products and services 
the company s average us pricing declined approximately from fiscal also contributing to the decline was increased labor costs as a percentage of revenue and higher depreciation resulting from the us fleet recapitalization initiative  a program which began in late to rebuild and upgrade the company s core fleet of fracturing pumping units in the us outlook the company s management believes that average us rig count for fiscal will be approximately higher than fiscal  essentially flat with current levels at approximately  rigs

results for fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or from fiscal in canada  revenues increased compared to fiscal with a corresponding increase in the average active drilling rigs in canada from fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the activity increase was primarily in shallow drilling areas of southern canada as warm weather delayed rig movement into the north  an area with historically higher revenue per job 
in addition  canada had a favorable exchange rate effect as the us dollar weakened against the canadian dollar compared to fiscal revenues in russia increased from fiscal due to revenues associated with service rigs acquired in the third quarter of fiscal  partially offset by activity delays as a result of extremely cold weather during the first quarter of fiscal asia pacific revenue increased from the prior fiscal year as a result of activity and market share increases in malaysia and new zealand 
europe and africa revenue increased from fiscal due to strong coiled tubing and cementing activity in norway and africa 
revenue in latin america increased over fiscal primarily as a result of increased market share in brazil with the acquisition of maritima in june and the commissioning of the blue shark stimulation vessel in april these increases in latin america were mostly offset by declines in venezuela as a result of the national labor strike 
in addition  there were declines in india resulting from activity declines 
operating income was million  an increase of million  or from the fiscal year 
while favorable foreign exchange rates in canada increased revenue  they had minimal impact on operating income as most of our expenses are also denominated in canadian dollars 
the increase in operating income was primarily due to activity increases and improved labor and equipment utilization efficiencies 
the headcount for year ended september  decreased compared to fiscal with revenue increasing million  or 

table of contents results for fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or from fiscal the revenue decrease was largely attributable to the company s canadian operations  with a decrease in revenue corresponding to a decline in drilling activity from fiscal the company also had a decrease in revenue in latin america of as compared to fiscal  due primarily to activity declines in argentina and venezuela as a result of political uncertainties and economic declines 
revenue from operations in the eastern hemisphere which includes the company s operations in europe and africa  the middle east  asia pacific  russia and china increased from fiscal  led by increases in the middle east 
increased activity in india and kazakhstan were the main contributors to the middle east growth 
operating income was million  a decrease of million  or from fiscal  primarily due to reduced activity in canada and political uncertainties and economic declines in argentina and venezuela 
in addition  there were approximately million in combined costs from the devaluation of argentina s currency and severance costs incurred in connection with reductions in personnel in canada and latin america during the second quarter of fiscal the eastern hemisphere experienced a decrease in operating income from fiscal primarily due to decreased profitability in the europe and africa region 
outlook the company expects international drilling activity outside of canada to remain relatively flat for fiscal compared to fiscal drilling activity in canada is expected to increase approximately for fiscal over fiscal effective july   the company implemented a price book increase of in canada  which will be phased in over the next several quarters 
the degree of customer acceptance of the price book increase will depend on activity levels and competitive pressures 
currently  most of our canadian revenue generated is on the new price book 
other oilfield services segment the other oilfield services segment consists of production chemicals  casing and tubular services  process and pipeline services  and with the acquisition of osca on may   completion tools and completion fluids services in the us and select markets internationally 
see business included elsewhere in the company s annual report on form k for more information 
results for fiscal compared to fiscal revenue was million  an increase of million  or when compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to the addition of completion fluids and completion tools service lines acquired with osca on may  other oilfield services revenue excluding completion fluids and completion tools increased  primarily as a result of geographic expansion of our casing and tubular services and the process and pipeline services 
operating income for the company s other oilfield services segment was million  an increase of million  or from prior year 
the increase was due primarily to the addition of completion fluids and completion tools service lines acquired with osca on may  other oilfield services operating income excluding completion fluids and completion tools increased  primarily as a result of geographic expansion of our casing and tubular services and the process and pipeline services  which is consistent with the increase in revenue mentioned above 
results for fiscal compared to fiscal revenue was million  an increase of million  or when compared to fiscal approximately million of the increase relates to the completion fluids and completion tools service lines acquired with osca  effective may  other oilfield services revenue excluding completion fluids and 
table of contents completion tools increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal casing and tubular service revenue increased by through activity improvements and expansion in west africa and the middle east 
the process and pipeline and production chemicals division revenue was flat compared to fiscal operating income for the company s other oilfield services segment was million  a decrease of million  or from prior year 
despite the increase in revenue  there were reduced profit margins in process and pipeline services operations combined with million of costs associated with the acquisition of osca  consisting primarily of the disposal of completion tools deemed obsolete as a result of the combination 
other oilfield services operating income excluding completion fluids and completion tools decreased  due to reduced profit margins in process and pipeline service operations 
outlook we expect revenue for this segment to increase modestly in fiscal  primarily attributable to expanded markets for the completion tools and completion fluids business 
financial position and liquidity financial position the company s working capital increased million at september  compared to september  cash and cash equivalents increased million  driven primarily by positive cash flow from operations 
the company s long term debt consists of fixed term instruments and therefore  cash and cash equivalents were not used to pay down debt in fiscal accounts receivable increased million and accounts payable increased million as a result of increased activity 
as a result of higher taxable income in and utilizing most of our net operating loss carryforwards  our current tax liability increased million 
during the second fiscal quarter of  the company sold convertible senior notes and received gross proceeds of million see below discussion in liquidity and capital resources 
the company used million of the aggregate net proceeds to fund a substantial portion of the purchase price of its acquisition of osca on may  capital expenditures the company anticipates spending approximately million in fiscal  compared to million spent in and million spent in the capital expenditure program is expected to consist primarily of spending for the enhancement of the company s existing pressure pumping equipment  continued investment in the us fracturing fleet recapitalization initiative and stimulation expansion internationally 
the company has made significant progress with the us fleet recapitalization initiative  which is now approximately complete 
the actual amount of capital expenditures will depend primarily on maintenance requirements and expansion opportunities and is expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities 
liquidity and capital resources in june  the company replaced its existing credit facility with a new million committed line of credit committed credit facility 
the committed credit facility consists of a million  day commitment that renews annually at the option of the lenders and a million three year commitment 
the current committed credit facility expires in june and the company expects to replace this facility during the year 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the committed credit facility at september  in addition to the committed credit facility  the company had million in various unsecured  discretionary lines of credit at september   which expire at the bank s discretion 
there are no 
table of contents requirements for commitment fees or compensating balances in connection with these lines of credit  and interest on borrowings is based on prevailing market rates 
there were million and million in outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit at september  and september   respectively 
in june  the company repurchased and retired million of its notes maturing in and recorded associated debt extinguishment costs of million classified as other expense  consisting mainly of a million early payment premium 
at september  and september   the company had issued and outstanding million of its notes 
on april  the company sold convertible senior notes with a face value at maturity of million gross proceeds of million 
the notes are unsecured senior obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of the company s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness 
the company used the aggregate net proceeds of million to fund a substantial portion of the purchase price of its acquisition of osca  which closed on may   and for general corporate purposes 
there were million and million outstanding under the convertible senior notes at september  and september   respectively 
the notes will mature in and cannot be called by the company for three years after issuance 
if the company exercises its right to call the notes  the redemption price must be paid in cash 
holders of the notes can require the company to repurchase the notes on the third  fifth  tenth and fifteenth anniversaries of the issuance 
the company has the option to pay the repurchase price in cash or stock 
the issue price of the notes was for each  in face value  which represents an annual yield to maturity of 
of this yield to maturity  per year on the issue price will be paid semi annually in cash for the life of the security 
the notes are convertible into bj services common stock at an initial rate of shares for each  face amount note 
this rate results in an initial conversion price of per share based on the purchaser s original issue discount and represents a premium of over the april  closing sale price of the company s common stock on the new york stock exchange of per share 
the company has the option and currently has the ability and the intent to settle notes that are surrendered for conversion using cash 
generally  except upon the occurrence of specified events  including a credit rating downgrade to below investment grade  holders of the notes are not entitled to exercise their conversion rights until the company s stock price is greater than a specified percentage beginning at and declining to at the maturity of the notes of the accreted conversion price per share 
at september   the accreted conversion price per share would have been 
in calendar year  the company will have a minimum pension funding requirement of million 
this is expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities 
the company s total debt net of cash was of its total capitalization total capitalization equals the sum of debt  net of cash and stockholders equity at september   compared to at september  the committed credit facility includes various customary covenants and other provisions including the maintenance of certain profitability and solvency ratios  none of which materially restrict the company s activities 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants imposed by the terms of its indebtedness 
management believes that the committed credit facility  combined with other discretionary credit facilities and cash flows from operations  provide the company with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage its routine operations  meet debt service obligations and fund projected capital expenditures 
if the discretionary lines of credit are not renewed  or if borrowings under these lines of credit otherwise become unavailable  the company expects to refinance this debt by arranging additional committed bank facilities or through other long term borrowing alternatives

table of contents accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement legal obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  associated costs are capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas requires entities to record the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the income statement in the period of adoption 
the company adopted sfas on october  the company has an asset retirement obligation aro with respect to machinery and equipment permanently affixed to the decks of certain leased vessels 
the company is obligated to remove the machinery and equipment and restore the vessel to its original condition upon returning the vessel to the owner 
the company determined the fair value of the aro by using the expected cash flow approach and probability weighting multiple scenarios and related outcomes 
the cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas had no effect on earnings per share 
the aro was million at october  due to the immaterial effects that this new standard had on a cumulative basis as of october  we are not presenting pro forma aro disclosures 
based on our aro s as of october   on an annual basis  we expect depreciation expense to increase by approximately million and to incur accretion expense of approximately million as a result of adopting sfas in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed and also broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
sfas supercedes sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and apb opinion  while retaining many of the requirements of these two statements 
under sfas  assets held for sale that are a component of an entity will be included in discontinued operations if the operations and cash flows will be or have been eliminated from ongoing operations and the reporting entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the discontinued operations prospectively 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas did not materially change the methods used by the company to measure impairment losses on long lived assets but may result in future dispositions being reported as discontinued operations to a greater extent than is currently permitted 
the company adopted sfas on october  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas replaces accounting guidance provided by eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in november  fasb interpretation no

  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin was issued 
the interpretation requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that obligation 
this interpretation is intended to improve the comparability of financial reporting by requiring identical accounting for guarantees issued with separately identified consideration and guarantees issued without separately identified consideration

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
this statement amends sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
this statement also requires that those effects be disclosed more prominently by specifying the form  content and location of those disclosures 
sfas is intended to improve the prominence and clarity of the pro forma disclosures required by sfas by prescribing a specific tabular format and by requiring disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies or its equivalent 
in addition  this statement is intended to improve the timeliness of those disclosures by requiring their inclusion in financial reports for interim periods 
sfas also amends certain disclosure requirements under apb this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  and is effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  the company did not adopt fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and therefore  adoption of sfas on january  impacted the disclosures only  not the financial results of the company 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  fin applies to public enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim or annual period 
the company adopted fin on july  adoption of the provisions of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued an exposure draft regarding employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
it would not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by existing accounting pronouncements  however  it would replace sfas  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits sfas 
if implemented as proposed  it would retain most of the disclosure requirements of sfas and would require additional disclosures about assets  obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
as proposed  the effective date would be for fiscal years after december  in addition  there would be additional disclosure requirements for interim period financial reports for the first fiscal quarter of the year following initial application for the annual disclosure requirements 
since the exposure draft only revises disclosure requirements  it will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
non gaap financial measures a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant s historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented 
table of contents in accordance with gaap in the statement of income  balance sheet  or statement of cash flows  or includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented 
from time to time  the company utilizes non gaap financial measures 
the most common non gaap financial measures used by the company include ebitda  ebitda margin  free cash flow  net debt  and net interest expense 
ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization is computed by starting with net income  adding income tax expense  adding interest expense  deducting interest income and adding depreciation and amortization 
the most comparable gaap measure is cash flow from operating activities as depicted in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
ebitda less income tax expense  less interest expense  plus interest income  plus or minus changes in working capital  plus minority interest  plus unearned compensation  plus deferred taxes reconciles to cash flow from operating activities 
ebitda margin is simply ebitda as a percentage of revenue 
management believes ebitda and ebitda margin provide useful information to investors as they represent the measure of pre tax cash flow of the company  prior to debt service requirements 
free cash flow is computed by starting with net income  adding depreciation and amortization and deducting capital expenditures 
the most comparable gaap measure is cash flow from operating activities 
free cash flow plus capital expenditures  plus changes in working capital  plus minority interest  plus unearned compensation  plus deferred taxes reconciles to cash flow from operating activities 
management believes free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it represents the cash  in excess of capital commitments  available to the company to operate the business and meet non discretionary expenditures 
net debt and net interest expense are easily calculated from gaap measures 
net debt is computed by adding short term and long term debt  less cash 
net interest expense is computed by subtracting interest income from interest expense
