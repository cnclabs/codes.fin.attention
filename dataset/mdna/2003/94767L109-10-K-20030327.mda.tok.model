customers and distribution partners we sell our services directly to our customers and indirectly through our distribution partners 
we offer our services on a monthly subscription basis to our customers and through a revenue share  discounted or pay per use basis to our distribution partners 
our customers purchase and use our services themselves while our distribution partners integrate and resell our services with their offerings 
some of our distribution partners are also end user customers 
as of december  and  we had subscription agreements with over  and  customers  respectively 
in  we derived more than of our revenue from direct sales to customers 
as of december   we had agreements in place with approximately distribution partners  including portals  software and service vendors and communications service providers 
in we generated less than of our revenue from these relationships 
software and service vendors have agreements to resell our services to end users by marketing  and in some cases integrating  our services into their product or service offerings 
communications service providers typically resell our services in conjunction with their teleconferencing services 
our distribution agreements typically have terms of one to three years and are automatically renewed for additional one year terms unless either party terminates the agreement with days prior written notice 
in most of these agreements  the distribution partner purchases subscription or pay per use services from webex and resells such services to end user customers 
under these agreements  the amount of revenue we receive depends on the level of commitment and volume of business generated under the agreement 
under our distribution agreements  either webex or the distribution partner bills the end user customers 
when webex bills the end user  a percentage of the proceeds generated from the distribution partner s sale of webex services is paid to the distribution partner and the remainder is retained by webex 
when the distribution partner bills the end user  webex sells the services on a discounted basis to the distribution partner  which in turn marks up the price and sells the services to the end user 
in  sales of our meeting center service  whether directly to our customers or indirectly through our distribution partners  accounted for approximately of our revenue 
in and  respectively  sales of our meeting center service accounted for and of our revenue 
this decline may continue as we introduce new product offerings and increase revenue in other existing products 
third party software and hardware we license software and purchase hardware  such as database  operating system  and web server software  font technology and servers  routers and audio conference bridges 
we believe this third party technology allows us to integrate current and emerging technology into our service offerings 
these third party technologies include 
table of contents bea systems application servers  bitstream font technology  oracle database technology and voyant audio conference bridges 
research and development the emerging market for web communications services is characterized by rapid technological change  new product introductions and enhancements  evolving customer requirements and rapidly changing industry standards 
we devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing and enhancing our network services and application platform  extending our global network  and conducting quality assurance testing 
as of december   we had employees engaged in research and development activities 
our research and development expenditures were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to devote significant resources to research and development for the foreseeable future 
a significant amount of our development and testing activity is conducted by our subsidiary in china webex china 
prior to february  our development and testing activity was conducted by three companies in china  which are owned by our president and chief technical officer  mr 
min zhu  and his spouse 
in february  webex china acquired substantially all of the assets of these three companies for a cash purchase price of million and hired approximately of their employees 
the valuation of the assets was determined by an independent appraisal 
prior to the completion of this asset purchase  we had contracts with these companies under which they performed development projects  assigned ownership of the work performed to us  and invoiced us for services rendered based on a monthly fee per employee working on webex projects 
sales and marketing our sales efforts target a broad range of businesses  government agencies and non profit organizations primarily through direct sales channels and  to a lesser extent  through indirect sales channels 
direct sales are generated through our internal sales force  while indirect sales are generated through agreements with our distribution partners 
our internal sales force uses our own webex services to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of our direct sales channel 
as of december   we had employees engaged in sales and marketing activities 
our sales and marketing expenditures were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to devote significant resources to sales and marketing for the foreseeable future 
our marketing programs include customer needs assessment and market analysis  service and platform marketing  brand awareness  advertising  public relations  lead generation  and educating organizations in our target markets 
in december  we entered into an agreement with actress lily tomlin under which ms 
tomlin is serving as a celebrity spokesperson for webex in webex print  electronic and digital media advertising campaigns 
competition the market for web communications services is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and is significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
although we do not currently compete against any one entity with respect to all aspects of our services  we do compete with various companies in regards to specific elements of our web communications services 
for example  we compete with providers of traditional communications technologies such as teleconferencing and videoconferencing  applications software and tools companies  and web conferencing 
table of contents services such as centra software  genesys  raindance  ibm lotus sametime  oracle i meeting  microsoft netmeeting and placeware 
in january  microsoft announced that that it had signed an agreement to acquire placeware 
other software vendors  such as oracle  have announced the availability of competitive offerings 
other companies could choose to extend their products and services to include web communications services in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we have 
our current and future competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
some of these competitors  such as microsoft  have dominant positions in other technology markets and may seek to leverage those positions to expand their presence in the web communications services market  which may make it more difficult for other vendors  such as webex  to compete 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established  and may in the future establish  cooperative relationships with third parties and with each other to increase the availability of their products and services to the marketplace 
competitors may introduce products or services that have better capabilities or performance  lower prices  or broader distribution or market acceptance which could cause us to lose customers  lose revenue and earnings  lose market share or require us to increase expenses or reduce the price of our services  any of which could harm our business and operating results 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include service functionality  quality and performance  ease of use  reliability  scalability and security of services  establishing a significant base of customers and distribution partners  access to distribution channels  ability to introduce new services to the market in a timely manner  customer service and support  attracting third party developers  and pricing 
although we believe our services compete favorably with respect to many of these factors  the market for our services is new and rapidly evolving 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with greater resources 
intellectual property the status of united states patent protection in the internet industry is not well defined and will evolve as the us patent and trademark office grants additional patents 
we currently have three issued patents in the areas of peer to peer connections to facilitate conferencing  document annotation and optimizing data transfer  and we currently have patent applications pending in the united states 
we may seek additional patents in the future 
we do not know if our patent applications or any future patent application will result in any patents being issued with the scope of the claims we seek  if such patents are issued at all 
we do not know whether any patents we have received or may receive will be challenged  invalidated or be of any value 
it is difficult to monitor unauthorized use of technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states  and our competitors may independently develop technology similar to ours 
we will continue to seek patent and other intellectual property protections  when appropriate  for those aspects of our technology that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages 
the pending  and any future  patent applications may not result in the issuance of valid patents 
our success depends in part upon our rights to proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret  trademark and contractual protection to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we 
table of contents routinely require our employees  customers and potential business distribution partners to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements before we will disclose any confidential aspects of our services  technology or business plans 
in addition  we require all employees  and those consultants involved in the deployment of our services  to agree to assign to us any proprietary information  inventions or other intellectual property they generate  or come to possess  while employed by us 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our services or technology 
these precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  we may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
we may be unaware of filed patent applications which have not yet been made public and which relate to our services 
from time to time we receive notices alleging that we infringe intellectual property rights of third parties 
in such cases  we typically investigate and respond to the allegations 
we are currently not aware of any such allegations that we believe represent a risk of material liability to us 
in addition  in july  a lawsuit was filed by eric hamilton  an individual  in us district court for the district of maryland alleging infringement of us patent number  the hamilton patent against us and several other companies 
in march  we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiff pursuant to which the plaintiff released us from all claims asserted in the lawsuit and agreed to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice 
although this lawsuit was settled  other intellectual property claims may be asserted against us in the future 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from running our business 
intellectual property litigation could also require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  including in research and development  in sales and marketing  in set up  support and training  and in general and administrative 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
in february  our subsidiary in china hired approximately additional employees engaged in research and development 
we believe our relations with our employees are good 
available information our website is located at http www

we make available  free of charge  on or through our website  our annual  quarterly and current reports  and any amendments to those reports  as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such reports with the securities and exchange commission 
item properties we currently lease approximately  square feet in three buildings in san jose  california  which are used for sales  engineering  support  network operations  and general corporate functions  including our corporate headquarters 
the lease terms for two of these buildings expire in september  and for the third building in february of the  square feet   square feet have been sub leased under a non cancelable sub lease that expires in july  although the sub lessee is currently delinquent as to a portion of the payments owing under the sublease 
we are also leasing approximately  square feet of space in sacramento  california  which is used for sales and support activities 
we also have leased facilities in atlanta  denver  raleigh  chicago  amsterdam  melbourne and tokyo 
the lease terms range from june to february as a result of our acquisition in february of substantially all of the assets of three companies in china  we

we believe that these offices will be adequate to meet our requirements for the next months 
item legal proceedings in july  a lawsuit was filed by eric hamilton  an individual  in us district court for the district of maryland alleging infringement of us patent number  the hamilton patent against us and several other companies 
the complaint alleged that the defendants  including webex  manufactured  marketed and sold products and services that infringed several claims of the hamilton patent 
in march  webex entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiff pursuant to which the plaintiff released webex from all claims asserted in the lawsuit and agreed to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice

table of contents critical accounting policies we believe that there are a number of accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  sales reserves  and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
revenue recognition 
revenue is derived from web communication services 
web communication services revenue is generated through a variety of contractual arrangements directly with customers and with distribution partners  who in turn sell the services to customers 
we sell web communication services directly to customers through service subscriptions and pay per use arrangements 
under these arrangements  customers access the application hosted on webex servers using a standard web browser 
subscription arrangements include monthly subscriber user fees and user set up fees 
the subscription arrangements are considered service arrangements in accordance with eitf issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
accordingly  revenue is recognized ratably over the service period provided that evidence of the arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
initial set up fees received in connection with these arrangements are recognized ratably over the initial term of the contract 
during the initial term  we provide training services  web page design and set up services 
in addition to the subscription services revenue  we derive revenue from pay per use services and telephony charges that are recognized as the related services are provided 
we also enter into reselling arrangements with distribution partners  which purchase and resell our services on a revenue sharing  discounted or pay per use basis 
revenue under these arrangements is derived from hosted services provided to end users and is recognized over the service period provided that evidence of the arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
initial set up fees received in connection with these arrangements are recognized ratably over the initial term of the contract 
during the initial term  we provide training services  web page design and set up services 
service fees are recognized as the services are provided for pay per use service arrangements and ratably over the service period for services provided on a subscription basis through the reseller 
our reseller arrangements may require guaranteed minimum revenue commitments that are billed in advance to the reseller 
advance payments received from distribution partners are deferred until the related services are provided or until otherwise earned by us 
we contract directly with the distribution partner  and revenue is recognized based on net amounts charged to the distribution partner 
persuasive evidence for all of our arrangements is represented by a signed contract 
the fee is considered fixed or determinable if it is not subject to refund or adjustment 
collectibility of guaranteed minimum revenue commitments by resellers is not reasonably assured  thus revenue from guaranteed minimum commitments is deferred until services are sold by the reseller to an end user customer or until the end of the commitment period and forfeited by the reseller 
sales reserves 
an estimate of the sales reserve for losses on receivables resulting from customer cancellations or terminations is recorded as a reduction in revenues at the time of the sale 
the sales reserve is estimated based on an analysis of the historical rate of cancellations or terminations 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the rate of future cancellations or terminations being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of actual cancellations or terminations is greater than the historic rate  then the sales reserve may not be sufficient to provide for actual losses 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for losses on accounts receivable due to customer credit risk 
increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to general and administrative expense as bad debt expense 
losses on accounts receivable due to financial distress or failure of the customer are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance is estimated based 
table of contents on an analysis of the historical rate of credit losses 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the future rate of credit losses being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of future credit losses is greater than the historical rate  then the allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to provide for actual credit losses 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenue 
years ended december  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative equity based compensation total operating expenses operating income loss interest and other income  net net income loss before income tax provision for income tax net income loss revenue 
revenue increased from million in to million in and to million in  representing an increase of from to and an increase of from to these increases were primarily due to growth in our subscribing customer base and the increased adoption by existing customers 
by the end of  the number of customers in our subscribing base had grown by more than from the end of cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue consists of costs related to user set up  network and data center operations  technical support and training activities including internet access and telephony communication costs  personnel  licensed software and equipment costs and depreciation 
cost of revenue increased from million in to million in and to million in as a percent of revenue  cost of revenue decreased from in to in and to in these increases in cost of revenue were primarily due to increases in the cost for delivering existing and new services to more customers  additional technical staff to support our growing installed base of customers and new services  and expanding and improving our worldwide network 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expense consists of personnel costs  including commissions  as well as costs of public relations  advertising  marketing programs  lead generation  travel and trade shows 
sales and marketing expense decreased from million in to million in and increased to million in the decrease from to was primarily due to reduced spending on advertising focused on our building brand awareness 
the decrease was partially offset by increases in our sales force and higher sales commissions as our sales volume increased 
in  our sales and marketing spending increased in absolute dollars compared to due to increased sales spending to expand our sales force and in marketing spending for advertising focused on building brand awareness and generating sales leads 

table of contents research and development 
our research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  depreciation of equipment  supplies and consulting engineering services 
research and development expense increased from million in to million in and to million in these increases were primarily related to personnel related expenses resulting from increases in staffing and incremental payments to companies in china providing engineering services to webex on a contract basis 
included in research and development expense are million  million and million  in  and  respectively  for the cost of engineering services provided by these companies in china 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  legal and general management  as well as professional expenses  such as legal and accounting  and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in and to million in these increases were primarily due to higher professional fees  bad debt expense  personnel and payroll related expenses 
bad debt expense increased from million in to million in and to million in the increases are primarily related to the increased size of our installed customer base  which is used to calculate potential future credit losses based on historical losses 
equity based compensation 
our equity based compensation expense represents the amortization of deferred equity based compensation over the vesting period of incentive stock options granted to employees and expenses related to issuance of common stock warrants and options to non employees 
deferred equity based compensation represents the difference between the exercise price of the stock options granted to employees and the fair value of common stock at the time of those grants 
equity based compensation expense decreased from million in to million in and to million in the decreases from year to year were primarily due to the vesting of options granted  forfeitures of unvested options by terminated employees and the effects of the fluctuations of our stock price on the recognition of expense on options granted to non employees  offset by compensation recorded by us in connection with the modification of awards to terminated employees 
equity based compensation expense related to the unvested portion of non employee options will be impacted by future changes in our stock price and will fluctuate accordingly 
in connection with the calculation of equity based compensation expense  members of our board of directors are treated the same as employees of webex 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net is comprised of interest income and expense and other expenses 
interest and other income  net decreased from million in to million in and increased to million in the decrease from to was primarily due to an impairment write down of million of our million investment in a distribution partner  tonbu  inc  and lower market interest rates 
in  we wrote down the remaining million investment in tonbu 
the impairment charges on our investment in tonbu resulted from a determination that an other than temporary decline in its value had occurred after the evaluation of several factors  including recent capital raising activities undertaken by tonbu 
the increase from to was primarily due to lower impairment charges offset by less interest earned due to lower market interest rates 
income taxes 
because we incurred net operating losses in and  we paid no federal  state and foreign income taxes in those periods  nor did we recognize any tax benefits for the related tax operating loss carryforwards 
during  we realized pre tax earnings and we have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset taxable income in the us based on our cumulative losses  we do not believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized  accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been established and no deferred tax assets are shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
if we continue to experience growth in profitable operations in  we may have evidence to support the recognition of deferred tax assets 
we recorded a provision for income tax of million during related to foreign and state taxes 
as of december   the company had approximately million and million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes  respectively  available to offset income in future years 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years from to and the state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in the company had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for foreign income tax purposes 
the foreign net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely 

table of contents net income loss 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported net income of million in and net loss of million and million in and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering  we financed our operations primarily from the private sale of preferred equity securities 
upon completion of our initial public offering of common stock in  a total of  shares were sold to the public  which resulted in proceeds to webex  after offering expenses  of million 
in  we sold an additional  shares of common stock in a private placement  which resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  an increase of million compared with cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  as of december   our debt was million compared with outstanding debt of million as of december  net cash provided by used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by operating activities in was the result of net income adjusted for non cash components offset by increases in accounts receivable 
net cash used in and resulted primarily from net losses adjusted for non cash components and increases in accounts receivable offset by increases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash used by investing activities related primarily to the purchase of short term investments and capital expenditures for equipment  hardware and software used in our mediatone network  and a loan to our chief executive officer in which was partially repaid in and fully repaid in net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the sale of our series d preferred stock and initial public offering in  the private placement of common stock and bank borrowings in  and the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of common stock offset by the repayment of debt in we have a revolving credit line with a bank that provides available borrowings of up to million 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit line bear interest at the prime rate plus and may be repaid and reborrowed at any time prior to the maturity date 
the credit agreement expires on june  the credit agreement is collateralized by all tangible and intangible assets of webex and is subject to compliance with covenants  including a minimum liquidity ratio  minimum cash balance  minimum tangible net worth  maximum quarterly operating losses adjusted for equity based compensation charges  and minimum quarterly revenue 
as of december   we have no outstanding borrowings under the credit line 
as of december   our outstanding purchase commitments  including those for usage of telecommunication lines and data services  equipment and software purchases and construction of leasehold improvements at new leased facilities  totaled million 
we expect the majority of these purchase commitments to be settled in cash within the next months with the longest commitment expiring in august we lease office facilities under various operating leases that expire through total future minimum lease payments under these leases are approximately million 
we expect that existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we generated positive cash flow from operations in each quarter of we anticipate that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in and that existing cash reserves will therefore be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements during this period 
if revenue in is less than anticipated  we may take steps to reduce our discretionary expenses  such 
table of contents as marketing  reduce planned capital expenditures or limit the growth of personnel 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional public or private equity securities or obtain additional debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available at all or  if available  would be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned technology and product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
recent accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires the discontinuance of goodwill amortization and that it be assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators exist

this statement provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with disposal activities and is effective on january  under sfas  companies will record the fair value of exit or disposal costs when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the adoption of sfas could result in our recognizing the cost of future restructuring activities  if any  over a period of time rather than in one reporting period 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others  fin 
fin requires the company to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in the issuance of the guarantee 
fin is effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements effective for the year ending december  expand the disclosures required by a guarantor about its obligations under a guarantee 
the adoption of the disclosure requirements of this statement did not impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  sfas was issued 
sfas amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock 
table of contents based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on the reported results 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  and interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of the disclosure requirements of this statement did not impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the emerging issues task force issued a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf mandates how to identify whether goods or services or both that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for as separate units of accounting 
the consensus is effective prospectively for our third quarter of  and we are currently evaluating the effects of adoption of eitf on our service arrangements 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin 
the interpretation provides guidance for determining when a primary beneficiary should consolidate a variable interest entity  or equivalent structure  that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
the interpretation is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  for variable interest entities created before february  the adoption of this statement is not expected to impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that may affect results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if an adverse outcome of any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
although we realized net earnings in  we incurred net losses in   and  and there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve comparable results in the future  and we may experience net losses in future quarters 
although we realized net earnings of approximately million for the year ended december   we incurred net losses of approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   and we may experience net losses in future quarters if the web communications market softens significantly  or if existing or future competitors reduce our current market share in the web communications market 
if we incur net losses in the future  we may not be able to maintain or increase the number of our employees  our investment in expanding our services and network  or our sales  marketing and research and development programs in accordance with our present plans  each of which is critical to our long term success 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
because our quarterly results vary and are difficult to predict  we may fail to meet quarterly financial expectations  which may cause our stock price to decline 
we commenced operations in february and our business originally consisted of consulting services 
in early  we licensed an interactive communications product to a small number of customers 
we began offering webex meeting center in february  our first real time  interactive multimedia communications service  and began selling this service to customers and distribution partners 
we now offer several web communications services in addition to meeting center  though a few of these services have been launched only in recent months 
because of our limited operating history of providing services and other factors  our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict 
in addition  because of the emerging nature of the market for web communications services  our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
a number of other factors could cause fluctuations in our operating results 

table of contents factors outside our control include our distribution partners degree of success in distributing our services to end users  the announcement  introduction and market acceptance of new or enhanced services or products by our competitors  changes in offerings or pricing policies of our competitors  and the growth rate of the market for web communications services 
factors within our control include our ability to develop  enhance and maintain our web communications network in a timely manner  the mix of services we offer  our ability to attract and retain customers  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business and network infrastructure  the announcement  introduction and market acceptance of new or enhanced services or products by us  and changes in our pricing policies  such as converting customers from subscription based pricing to pay per use pricing  or vice versa 
if any of these factors impact our business in a particular period  our operating results may be below market expectations  in which case the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
also  factors such as the growth rate of the market for our services  our ability to maintain and enhance our network services and platform  and our competitors success could impact our longer term financial performance by reducing demand for our services 
we expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase  and if our revenue does not correspondingly increase  our business and operating results will suffer 
we expect to continue to spend substantial financial and other resources on developing and introducing new services  and expanding our sales and marketing organization and network infrastructure 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectations of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular quarter is lower than we expect  we may be unable to reduce proportionately our operating expenses for that quarter  in which case our operating results for that quarter would be adversely affected 
our customers do not have long term obligations to purchase our services  therefore  our revenue and operating results could decline if our customers do not continue to use our services 
our customers do not have long term obligations to purchase services from us 
most of our subscription agreements have an initial term of three months 
although automatically renewed unless terminated  our contracts can be terminated on thirty days notice at the end of the initial term or any renewal term 
over of our customers have agreements with initial terms of three to twelve months 
in calendar  over of the contracts entered into were renewed beyond their initial term 
we terminate customers who fail to pay for our services 
in  we terminated approximately customers who had failed to pay for our services on a timely basis 
we anticipate that termination of non paying customers will continue for the foreseeable future 
in 
table of contents addition  some customers may voluntarily discontinue use of our services for a variety of reasons including the failure of the customer s employees to learn about and use our services  the failure of the services to meet the customer s expectations or requirements  financial difficulties experienced by the customer  or the customer s decision to use services or products offered by a competitor 
we may not obtain a sufficient amount of business to compensate for any customers that we may lose 
the loss of existing customers or our failure to obtain additional customers would harm our business and operating results 
our business and operating results may suffer if we fail to establish distribution relationships or if our distribution partners do not successfully market and sell our services 
to date  we have generated more than of our revenue from direct sales to customers 
as of december   we had distribution agreements in place with approximately distribution partners 
for the year ended december   we generated less than of our revenue from our distribution partners  which revenue consisted of initial set up fees  commitment payments  and service fees 
the majority of the payments received from our distribution partners have been initially recorded as deferred revenue because we defer revenue related to initial set up fees received at the beginning of the relationship and record revenue from subscription services over the course of the service period as the distribution partner resells our services 
we also do not recognize commitment fees as revenue until the commitment fee is fully earned at the end of the commitment period and paid 
we cannot anticipate the amount of revenue we will derive from these relationships in the future 
we must continue to establish and extend these distribution partnerships 
establishing these distribution relationships can take as long as several months or more 
it typically takes several months before our distribution arrangements generate significant revenue 
our distribution partners are not prohibited from offering and reselling the products and services of our competitors and may choose to devote insufficient resources to marketing and supporting our services or to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products and services of other companies 
if we fail to establish new distribution relationships in a timely manner  we lose existing distribution partners  or if our distribution partners do not successfully distribute our services  our ability to achieve market acceptance of our web communications services will suffer and our business and operating results will be harmed 
we expect to depend on sales of our webex meeting center service for the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our webex meeting center service accounted for more than of our revenue for the year ended december  although we have recently experienced growth in sales of our newer services  primarily our onstage  training center and support center services  these newer services may not provide significant revenue in the future 
if we are not successful in developing  deploying and selling new services  our operating results will suffer 
if our services fail to function when used by large numbers of participants  we may lose customers and our business and reputation may be harmed 
our strategy requires that our services be able to accommodate large numbers of meetings and users at any one time 
our network monitoring measures the capacity of our services by bandwidth use  and during  our average peak usage ran at less than of our capacity 
however  if we fail to increase our capacity consistent with our growth in usage  it could impact system performance 
in addition  we may encounter performance problems when making upgrades and modifications to our network 
if our services do not perform adequately  we may lose customers and be unable to attract new customers and our operating results could suffer 
our sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our quarty operating results 
we sometimes have a long sales cycle because of the need to educate potential customers regarding the benefits of web communications services 
our sales cycle varies depending on the size and type of customer contemplating a purchase 
potential customers frequently need to obtain approvals from multiple decision makers within their organization and may evaluate competing products and services prior to deciding to use our services 
our sales cycle  which can range from several weeks to several months or more  makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which use of our services may begin 

table of contents the existence of significant equity based compensation  along with possible future regulatory action requiring the reporting of employee stock options as an expense item  will negatively impact earnings 
as of december  we had approximately million in deferred equity based compensation 
this expense will generally be amortized over a two year period and will result in a decrease in earnings or an increase in losses 
we expect the amount of equity based compensation expense to decrease over time as a result of the vesting of options granted prior to our initial public offering 
however  the amount of future equity based compensation expense related to the unvested portion of option grants to non employees will fluctuate with our stock price  and  accordingly  the amount of future equity based compensation expense is difficult to predict 
in and  we granted stock options at exercise prices significantly lower than the deemed fair value  which has contributed to our equity based compensation expense 
regulatory authorities are currently reviewing various proposals that would change the way stock options are reported by public companies 
if there were a change in the law or in accounting standards that would require us to report stock options for employees as an expense  our net income would be negatively impacted 
if our branding and marketing efforts are not successful  our business may be harmed 
we believe that continued marketing and brand recognition efforts will be critical to achieve widespread acceptance of our web communications services 
our marketing and advertising campaigns or branding efforts may not be successful or consumers may not find our marketing efforts compelling 
if our marketing efforts are not successful  our business and operating results will be harmed 
we rely on our china subsidiary  which exposes us to risks of economic instability in china and risks related to political tension between china and the united states 
prior to february  a significant portion of our development and testing activity was conducted by three companies in china  which are owned by our president and chief technical officer  min zhu  and his spouse 
in february  our subsidiary webex china purchased substantially all of the assets of these three companies and hired from these companies a substantial percentage of their employees 
we believe our acquisition of these operations will cause our research and development expenses to increase 
as of february  we rely on webex china to conduct a significant portion of our quality assurance testing and software development activities 
there are four webex china facilities  located in each of hefei  hongzhou  shanghai and suzhou 
our reliance on webex china for a significant portion of our quality assurance and software development activities exposes us to a variety of economic and political risks including  but not limited to  technology development restrictions  potentially costly and pro employee labor laws and regulations governing our employees in china  and travel restrictions 
the loss of our webex china development and testing activity may cause our costs to increase 
in addition  current political and economic tensions between the united states and china could harm our ability to conduct operations in china  which could increase our operating costs and harm our business and operations 
we could incur unexpected costs resulting from claims relating to use of our services 
many of the business interactions supported by our services are critical to our customers businesses 
any failure in a customer s business interaction or other communications activity caused or allegedly caused by our services could result in a claim for damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure  and cause us to incur unexpected costs 
our customers and end users may use our services to share confidential and sensitive information  and if our system security is breached  our reputation could be harmed and we may lose customers 
our customers and end users may use our services to share confidential and sensitive information  the security of which is critical to their business 
third parties may attempt to breach our security or that of our customers 
we may be liable to our customers for any breach in security  and any breach could harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers 
in addition  computers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or 
table of contents electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to resolve problems caused by any breach 
the software underlying our services is complex  and our business and reputation could suffer if our services fail to perform properly due to undetected errors or similar problems with our underlying software 
complex software  such as the software underlying our services  often contains undetected errors 
we may be forced to delay commercial release of our services until problems are corrected and  in some cases  may need to implement enhancements to correct errors that we do not detect until after deployment of our services 
if we do detect an error in our software before we introduce new versions of our services  we might have to limit our services for an extended period of time while we resolve the problem 
in addition  problems with the software underlying our services could result in damage to our reputation  damage to our efforts to build brand awareness  loss of or delay in revenue  delays in our loss of market acceptance of our services  and unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 
if our services do not work with the many hardware and software platforms used by our customers and end users  our business may be harmed 
we currently serve customers and end users that use a wide variety of constantly changing hardware and software applications and platforms 
if our services are unable to support these platforms  they may fail to gain broad market acceptance  which would cause our operating results to suffer 
our success depends on our ability to deliver our services to multiple platforms and existing  or legacy  systems and to modify our services and underlying technology as new versions of applications are introduced 
in addition  the success of our services depends on our ability to anticipate and support new standards  especially web standards 
we license third party technologies  and if we cannot continue to license these or alternate technologies in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms  our business could suffer 
we intend to continue to license technologies from third parties  including applications used in our research and development activities and technology  which is integrated into our services 
for example  we license real time database replication software and font rendering technology 
these third party technologies  and any that we may utilize in the future  may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  we may fail to successfully integrate any licensed technology into our services 
this in turn could harm our business and operating results 
our recent growth has placed a strain on our infrastructure and resources  and if we fail to manage our future growth to meet customer and distribution partner requirements  our business could suffer 
we have experienced a period of rapid expansion in our personnel  facilities  and infrastructure that has placed a significant strain on our resources 
for example  our personnel increased from employees at december  to at december   and we expect continued increases in our personnel in our expansion has placed  and we expect that it will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could disrupt our operations or delay execution of our business plan and could consequently harm our business 

table of contents if we lose the services of subrah s 
iyar  our chief executive officer  or min zhu  our president and chief technical officer  our business may be harmed 
our success will depend on our senior executives 
in particular  the loss of the services of our chief executive officer and co founder  subrah s 
iyar  or our president  chief technical officer and co founder  min zhu  would harm our business 
we do not have long term employment agreements with or life insurance policies on any of our senior management 
if we are unable to attract  integrate and retain qualified personnel  our business could suffer 
our future success will depend on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly skilled engineering  technical  managerial  sales and marketing and customer support personnel 
we hired approximately people in  and we expect to continue to increase our personnel in in the past  we have had difficulty hiring qualified personnel as quickly as we have desired 
in particular  we have had difficulty hiring a sufficient number of qualified technical  development and support personnel 
although economic conditions in made hiring of personnel easier  we do not know what future labor market conditions will be 
if we encounter difficulty hiring  integrating and retaining a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future  the quality of our web communications services and our ability to develop new services  obtain new customers and provide a high level of customer service could all suffer  and consequently the health of our overall business could suffer 
in addition  if we hire employees from our competitors  these competitors may claim that we have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against any of these claims  regardless of their merits 
interruptions in either our internal or outsourced computer and communications systems could reduce our ability to provide our services and could harm our business and reputation 
the success of our web communications services depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our internal and outsourced computer and communications hardware and software systems 
any system failure that causes an interruption in our web communications services or a decrease in their performance could harm our relationships with our customers and distribution partners 
in this regard  some of our communications hardware and software are hosted at third party co location facilities 
these systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error  telecommunications failures  physical or remote break ins  sabotage  computer viruses and intentional acts of vandalism 
in addition  third party co location facilities may discontinue their operations due to poor business performance 
because a substantial part of our central computer and communications hardware and network operations are located in the san francisco bay area  an earthquake or other natural disaster could impair the performance of our entire network 
in the event of damage to or interruption of our internal or outsourced systems  if we are unable to implement our disaster recovery plans or our efforts to restore our services to normal levels in a timely manner are not successful  our business would be adversely affected 
in addition  business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur 
we might have liability for content or information transmitted through our communications services 
claims may be asserted against us for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other legal theories based on the nature and content of the materials transmitted through our web communications services 
defending against such claims could be expensive  could be time consuming and could divert management s attention away from running our business 
in addition  any imposition of liability could harm our reputation and our business and operating results  or could result in the imposition of criminal penalties 
our success depends upon the patent protection of our software and technology 
our success and ability to compete depend to a significant degree upon the protection of our underlying software and our proprietary technology through patents 
we regard the protection of patentable inventions as 
table of contents important to our future opportunities 
we currently have three issued patents in the areas of peer to peer connections to facilitate conferencing  document annotation and optimizing data transfer  and we currently have patent applications pending in the united states 
we may seek additional patents in the future 
our current patent applications cover different aspects of the technology used to deliver our services and are important to our ability to compete 
however  it is possible that any patents acquired by or issued to us may not be broad enough to protect us  any issued patent could be successfully challenged by one or more third parties  which could result in our loss of the right to prevent others from exploiting the inventions claimed in those patents  current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our services or design around any of our patents  our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  and effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which we do business 
we also rely upon trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets to protect our technology  which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property 
we also rely on a combination of laws  such as copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and contractual restrictions  such as confidentiality agreements and licenses  to establish and protect our technology

in july  a lawsuit was filed by eric hamilton  an individual  in us district court for the district of maryland alleging infringement of us patent number  the hamilton patent against us and several other companies 
in march  we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiff pursuant to which the plaintiff released us from all claims asserted in the lawsuit and agreed to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice 
although this lawsuit was settled  other intellectual property claims may be asserted against us in the future 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention away from running our business 
intellectual property litigation could also require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  in the event of a successful claim of infringement 
our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business 
we may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders  cause us to incur significant expenses or harm our operating results 
we may acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies or services 
as of december   we had no specific agreements  commitments or discussions with respect to any acquisitions or investments  other than our discussions concerning the acquisition by webex china of substantially all of the assets of three companies in china owned by our president and chief technical officer  min zhu and his spouse  which asset purchase took place in february integrating any newly acquired businesses  technologies or services may be expensive and time consuming 
to finance any acquisitions  it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and  in the case of equity financings  may result in dilution to our stockholders 
we may be unable to complete any acquisitions or investments on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
even if completed  we may be unable to operate any acquired businesses profitably or successfully integrate the employees  technology  products or services of any acquired businesses into our existing business 
if we are unable to integrate any newly acquired entities or technologies effectively  our operating results could suffer 
future acquisitions by us could also result in large and immediate write downs  or incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  any of which would harm our operating results 
we must compete successfully in the web communications services market 
the market for web communications services is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and is significantly affected by new product and service introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
although we do not currently compete against any one entity with respect to all aspects of our services  we do compete with various companies in regards to specific elements of our web communications services 
for example  we compete with providers of traditional communications technologies such as teleconferencing and videoconferencing  applications software and tools companies  and web conferencing services  such as centra software  genesys  raindance  ibm lotus sametime  microsoft netmeeting  oracle i meeting and placeware 
in january microsoft announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire placeware 
other companies could choose to extend their products and services to include interactive communications in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do 
our current and future competitors maybe able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established  and may in the future establish  cooperative relationships with third parties and with each other to increase the availability of their products and services to the marketplace 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce the price of our services  either of which could harm our business and operating results 
microsoft may become a formidable competitor in the web communications market  which may be enhanced by its announced intention to acquire placeware 
in january  microsoft announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire our competitor placeware 
if the acquisition is completed  microsoft could become a far more active and significant competitor in the 
table of contents specific interactive communications markets that we currently serve 
microsoft s announced intention to acquire placeware could mean microsoft will devote greater resources to the web communications market than it has in the past 
if microsoft ultimately acquires placeware  microsoft could invest a significant amount of financial and technical resources in improving the placeware web conferencing offering or microsoft s own netmeeting offering  or microsoft could develop entirely new web communications technologies 
additionally  microsoft could vastly increase the marketing resources devoted to the placeware s web conferencing offerings  microsoft s own netmeeting or other web communications technologies microsoft may be developing 
in addition  microsoft could seek to leverage its dominant market position in the operating system  productivity application or browser market to expand its presence in the web communications market  which may make it difficult for other vendors  such as webex  to compete 
while we believe that our current market leadership over placeware and netmeeting in web conferencing is in part due to the technologies and strategies we have employed in building our web communications network  we may not be able to continue to maintain our market leadership in the web conferencing market if microsoft aggressively pursues this market 
microsoft s competitive activity in the web communications market could have a significantly harmful effect on our business 
our future success depends on the broad market adoption and acceptance of web communications services 
the market for web communications services is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
market demand for communications services over the web is uncertain 
if the market for web communications services does not grow  our business and operating results will be harmed 
factors that might influence market acceptance of our services include the following  all of which are beyond our control willingness of businesses and end users to use web communications services for websites  the growth of the web and commercial on line services  the willingness of our distribution partners to integrate web communications services for websites in their service offerings  and the ongoing level of security and reliability for conducting business over the web 
our success depends on the continued growth of web usage and the continued growth in reliability and capacity of the internet 
because customers access our network through the web  our revenue growth depends on the continued development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
this continued development of the web would include maintenance of a reliable network with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  as well as timely development of complementary products and services  including high speed modems and other high bandwidth communications technologies  for providing reliable  high performance internet access and services 
because global commerce on the web and the on line exchange of information is new and evolving  we cannot predict whether the web will continue to be a viable commercial marketplace over the long term 
the success of our business will rely on the continued improvement of the web as a convenient and reliable means of customer interaction and commerce  as well as an efficient medium for the delivery and distribution of information by businesses to their employees 
if increases in web usage or the continued growth in reliability and capacity of the internet fail to materialize  our ability to deliver our services may be adversely affected and our operating results could suffer 
we face risks associated with government regulation of the internet  and related legal uncertainties 
currently  few existing laws or regulations specifically apply to the internet  other than laws generally applicable to businesses 
many internet related laws and regulations  however  are pending and may be adopted in the united states  in individual states and local jurisdictions and in other countries 
these laws may relate to many areas that impact our business  including encryption  network and information security  the convergence of 
table of contents traditional communication services  such as telephone services  with internet communications  taxes and wireless networks 
these types of regulations are likely to differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions 
non us countries and political organizations may impose  or favor  more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the united states  thus furthering the complexity of regulation 
in addition  state and local governments within the united states may impose regulations in addition to  inconsistent with  or stricter than federal regulations 
the adoption of such laws or regulations  and uncertainties associated with their validity  interpretation  applicability and enforcement  may affect the available distribution channels for and costs associated with our products and services 
the adoption of such laws and regulations may harm our business 
current and future economic and political conditions may adversely affect our business 
economic growth in the united states and throughout most of the world continues to be slow  and it is uncertain when economic conditions may improve 
in addition  the war in iraq and tensions throughout the middle east are having a negative effect on the economy and may impact the supply and price of petroleum products  which may in turn negatively impact the world economy 
moreover  the prospect of future terrorists attacks in the united states and elsewhere may have a further negative impact on the economy 
in particular  the technology and telecommunications sectors appear to have been particularly affected by the recent slowdown in the economy 
if poor economic conditions continue or worsen as a result of economic  political or social turmoil or military conflict  or if there are further terrorist attacks in the united states or elsewhere  our customers may not be able to pay for our services and our distribution partners may cease operations  which may harm our operating results 
we may experience power blackouts and higher electricity prices as a result of energy shortages or electrical system failures  which could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in  california experienced increased energy prices  energy shortages  and blackouts 
we rely on the major northern california public utility  pacific gas electric company pg e to supply electric power to our headquarters in northern california 
pg e has filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy act 
if power outages or energy price increases occur in the future in california or other locations where we maintain operations  such events could disrupt our operations  prevent us from providing our services  harm our reputation  and result in a loss of revenue and increase in our expenses  all of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile because of stock market fluctuations that affect the prices of technology stocks 
a decline in our stock price could result in securities class action litigation against us that could divert management s attention and harm our business 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
for example  between january  and december   our stock price has traded as high as on january   and as low as on october  our stock price could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including variations in our actual or anticipated operating results  sales of substantial amounts of our stock  announcements by or about us or our competitors  including technological innovation  new products  services or acquisitions  litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors  conditions in the internet industry  governmental regulation and legislation  and changes in securities analysts estimates of our performance  or our failure to meet analysts expectations 

table of contents many of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for internet technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations recently 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market prices of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of securities class action litigation  we could face substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
a small  but growing  part of our business is conducted outside the united states 
these services are generally priced in the local currency 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
when the amount of revenue obtained from sources outside the united states becomes significant  we may engage in hedging activities or other actions to decrease fluctuations in operating results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or market risk sensitive instruments 
instead  we invest in highly liquid investments with short maturities 
accordingly  we do not expect any material loss from these investments and believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material
