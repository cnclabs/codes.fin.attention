item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information is provided in connection with  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we operate on a fiscal year ending on april the following discussion and analysis is for the fiscal year ended april revenues total revenues of iret properties  our operating partnership  for fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in revenues received during fiscal was million greater than fiscal and million greater than fiscal this increase resulted from 
table of contents rent from properties acquired in fiscal in excess of that received in from the same properties rent from properties acquired in fiscal increase in rental income on existing properties a decrease in straight line rents a decrease in ancillary income a decrease in rent from properties sold rent from properties acquired in fiscal in excess of that received in from the same properties rent from properties acquired in fiscal increase in rental income on existing properties an increase in straight line rents an increase in ancillary income a decrease in rent from properties sold as illustrated above  the substantial majority of the increase in our gross revenue for fiscal and  respectively  resulted from the addition of new real estate properties to the iret properties portfolio rather than rental increases on existing properties 
for the next to months  we expect acquisitions to be the most significant factor to increase our revenues and ultimately our net income 
while acceptable real estate assets are still available for purchase  the slow economy combined with a widespread demand for real estate from traditional and non traditional investors has resulted in a significant reduction in the investment returns from all types of real estate 
this reduction in the rates of return has been offset to some extent by the dramatic drop in borrowing costs to historically low levels 
while we were able to take advantage of those lower borrowing costs for most of our recent acquisitions  the majority of our debt is fixed and not prepayable without significant prepayment costs and fees 
capital gain income iret properties realized capital gain income for fiscal of million 
this compares to million of capital gain income recognized in fiscal and million recognized in fiscal a list of the properties sold during each of these years showing sales price  depreciated cost plus sales costs and net gain loss is included below under the caption property dispositions 
we anticipate that we will continue to sell our older and smaller locations as opportunities arise 
we do not believe that this is inconsistent with our strategy of acquiring properties that we intend to retain for at least ten years

table of contents factors impacting net income during fiscal as compared to and compared to the prior two fiscal years  there were a number of factors that continued to limit the growth of our total revenue and ultimately negatively impacted our net income per share 
a discussion of the factors having the greatest impact on our business compared to the prior two fiscal years is set forth below 
while most of these negative influences show no signs of lessening in the next twelve months  the most significant negative factor  our uninvested cash that was raised in june   by our offering of additional shares  was resolved during our second quarter of fiscal by the investment of such cash 
despite the positive development pertaining to our uninvested cash  the same factor reduced our full earnings for fiscal increased economic vacancy 
during fiscal  vacancy levels at our stabilized multi family residential properties continued to increase throughout our entire portfolio from at the end of to at the end of fiscal likewise  vacancy levels at our stabilized commercial properties increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal a majority of the markets in which we operate continue to experience overall poor economic conditions as it pertains to job creation 
the poor economic climate has translated directly into increased vacancy at many of our properties 
our commercial vacancy is primarily due to our inability to either renew existing leases or to re lease space being vacated by tenants at the expiration of their lease 
while not necessarily indicative of future business cycles  in past economic downturns  a recovery in occupancy levels generally trails the pick up in economic activity by twelve months or more 
despite some positive economic developments  we have yet to see an increase in demand for multi family residential or commercial space 
we continue to expect that demand in our markets for both apartments and commercial space will remain weak through the balance of uninvested cash 
the most significant reason for the decline in net income per share during fiscal  as compared to fiscal and fiscal is the large balance of cash and marketable securities 
while this money was invested in short term income producing investments  we ordinarily seek to invest in income producing real estate 
during the first and second quarters of fiscal  we were able to fully invest the proceeds from the equity raised during first quarter into income producing real estate 
this delay in investing such proceeds resulted in a reduction in earnings per share for the fiscal year ending april  increased real estate taxes 
taxes imposed on our real estate properties increased by million or for the fiscal year ending april   as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal of the increased real estate taxes  million or is attributable to the addition of new real estate acquired in fiscal and  while million or is due to increased costs for real estate taxes on existing real estate assets 
most of our new property acquisitions during the past year 
table of contents were in minnesota  a jurisdiction with higher property taxes than north dakota and the other states in which we own property 
under the terms of most of our commercial leases  the full cost of real estate tax is paid by the tenant as additional rent 
one commercial property  southdale medical center  which is located in edina  minnesota  accounts for million or of the increase in real estate tax costs for the fiscal year ending april  due to increased vacancy at southdale medical center during fiscal we were unable to fully recover the real estate tax cost from the tenants 
we expect that the increased vacancy at southdale medical center will persist for at least the first three months of fiscal for our noncommercial real estate properties  any increase in our real estate tax costs must be collected from tenants in the form of a general rent increase 
while we have implemented portfolio wide rent increases  the current economic conditions and increased vacancy levels have prevented us from raising rents in the amount necessary to fully recover our increased real estate tax costs 
to further compound the problem  a number of states in which we operate are facing record state budget shortfalls 
our past experience is such shortfalls translate into local governments raising property taxes 
increased maintenance expense 
the maintenance expense category increased by million or for the fiscal year ending april   as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal of the increased maintenance costs for the fiscal year ending april   million or is attributable to the addition of new real estate acquired in fiscal and  while million or is due to increased costs for maintenance on existing real estate assets 
under the terms of most of our commercial leases  the full cost of maintenance is paid by the tenant as additional rent 
southdale medical center accounts for million or of the increase in maintenance costs for the fiscal year ending april  due to increased vacancy at southdale medical center during the fiscal year ending april   we were unable to fully recover the maintenance cost from the tenants 
for our noncommercial real estate properties  any increase in our maintenance costs must be collected from tenants in the form of a general rent increase 
while we have implemented portfolio wide rent increases  the current economic conditions and increased vacancy levels have prevented us from raising rents in the amount necessary to fully recover our increased maintenance costs 
increased utility expense 
the utility expense category increased by million or for the fiscal year ending april   as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal of the increased utility costs  million or is attributable to the addition of new real estate acquired in fiscal and  while million or is due to increased costs for utilities on existing real estate assets 
under the terms of most of our commercial leases  the full cost of utilities is paid by the tenant as additional rent 
southdale medical center accounts for million or of the increase in utility costs for the fiscal year ending april  
table of contents due to increased vacancy at southdale medical center during the fiscal year ending april   we were unable to fully recover the utility cost from the tenants 
for our other noncommercial real estate properties  any increase in our utility costs must be collected from tenants in the form of a general rent increase 
while we have implemented portfolio wide rent increases  the current economic conditions and increased vacancy levels have prevented us from raising rents in the amount necessary to fully recover our increased utility costs 
since our real estate portfolio is primarily located in minnesota and north dakota  the severity of winters will have a large impact on our utility costs 
increased administrative and operating expense 
administrative and operating expenses increased by million or for the fiscal year ending april   as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal of this increase in administrative and operating expense for the fiscal year ending april    or was due to professional fees and costs associated with our offering of shares in the first quarter of fiscal in prior years  the work associated with offerings of shares to the public was largely done by our employees 
over the past year we have hired ten new employees 
the addition of these new employees  together with increases in the wages and benefits paid to existing employees  account for  or of the increase in administrative and operating costs for the fiscal year ending april  increased insurance premiums 
insurance expense increased by million or for the fiscal year ending april   compared to the prior fiscal year 
of the increased insurance costs   or is attributable to the addition of new real estate  while million or is due to increased premium costs for coverage on existing real estate assets 
under the terms of most of our commercial leases  the full cost of insurance is paid by the tenant as additional rent 
for our other real estate properties  any increase in our insurance costs must be collected from tenants in the form of a general rent increase 
while we have implemented portfolio wide rent increases  the current economic conditions and increased vacancy levels have prevented us from raising rents in the amount necessary to fully recover our increased insurance costs 
we do not expect our insurance costs to decline during fiscal slower increase of interest expense 
our mortgage debt increased million or for the fiscal year ending april  due to the fact that interest rates on new mortgages incurred during those periods were at lower rates than mortgages in prior periods  our interest expense increased by only million or for the fiscal year ending april   as compared to the corresponding periods of fiscal of the increased interest expense for the fiscal year ending april   million or is attributable to the addition of new real estate  while interest expenses on existing real estate assets declined by million or  due primarily to the decline in interest rates on our adjustable rate mortgages 

table of contents increased minority partnership interests 
in addition to the factors discussed above that have negatively impacted our earnings per share despite an overall increase in gross revenue  the increase in the number of limited partnership units issued by iret properties has also had an impact on our revenue per share 
even though our revenue increased by million or for the fiscal year ending april   our net income only increased million or 
for the fiscal year ending april   outstanding limited partnership units increased by  under the terms of the agreement of limited partnership of iret properties  each limited partner is entitled to an equal allocation of net income or net loss 
limited partnership units are issued in exchange for the contribution of an interest in real estate 
if capital gain income and the limited partnership ownership interest reflected as minority interests on the financial statements are excluded  the increase in net income is more closely related to the increase in revenue for the fiscal year ending change net income add back portion allocated to minority interests other partnerships minority interests operating partnerships add back discontinued operations subtract capital gain income total portfolio net income telephone endorsement fee during fiscal  we received a payment of million from a major telecommunications provider for allowing marketing access by that provider to residents of the apartment communities owned by us  totaling  units 
the contract provides that we will allow promotional materials to be placed in our apartment communities advertising the availability of tele communication services over a year period 
of this payment   was recognized as income by us during fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal the balance of million will be recognized ratably over the remaining portion of the contract period and there is a possibility of a refund of these monies if we should violate the contractual terms of the agreement

table of contents funds from operations funds from operations ffo for the operating partnership increased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal  and  for fiscal we consider ffo a useful measure of performance for an equity reit 
ffo is a supplemental non gaap financial measurement used as a standard in the real estate industry to measure and compare the operating performance of real estate companies 
we adhere to the nareit definition of ffo 
nareit defines ffo as net income or loss  excluding gains on losses from sales of depreciated property  plus operating property depreciation and amortization and adjustments for minority interest and unconsolidated companies on the same basis 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies because not all real estate companies use the same definition 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs or our ability to service indebtedness or make distributions 
a reconciliation of ffo to gaap net income is as follows reconciliation of net income to funds from operations unaudited for the twelve month periods ended april  and and months ended weighted weighted weighted avg per avg per avg per amount shares share amount shares share amount shares share net income available for common shares   add back minority interest in earnings of unitholders  fully diluted net income   adjustments depreciation and amortization  earnings loss from depreciable property sales  fully diluted funds from operations   cash distributions paid to shareholders unitholders  depreciation on office equipment and other assets used by us are excluded 
amortization of financing and other expenses are excluded  except for amortization of leasing commissions which are included 
limited partnership units of iret properties are exchangeable for shares on a one for one basis 
cash distributions are paid equally on shares and limited partnership units 
it is our intent to distribute approximately to of ffo to our shareholders and the holders of limited partnership units of iret properties

net cash used in investing activities decreased to million from the million used in fiscal this decrease resulted because less cash was needed to acquire new investment properties 
net cash provided from financing activities also decreased to million from the year earlier figure of million because of a small decrease in our activity in acquiring new properties using borrowed funds

table of contents critical accounting policies our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in real property 
these policies affect the following straight line rents 
an accounting rule requires us to record as revenue straight line rents on our commercial property leases that contain future rental increases 
this rule requires us to calculate the total rents that the tenant has contracted to pay us for the entire term of the lease and to divide that total by the number of months of the lease and to record as revenue each month the resulting average monthly rent 
the result is that  in the beginning years of a lease  we must record as revenue an amount that exceeds the actual cash rent we have collected 
in the later years of such leases  we will record as revenue an amount less than the actual cash then being received 
the amount of straight line rents that is  the amount that the recorded rent is greater than the actual cash rent we have collected we have recorded in the past three years is straight line rents our revenues  net income and ffo shown in this report are increased by the above described straight line rents 
we have established an allowance for loss to provide for a reserve in the event of default of lease where straight line rents apply 
a summary of that reserve is as follows balance at beginning of year provision for doubtful accounts write offs balance at close of year revenue recognition 
residential rental properties are leased under operating leases with terms generally of one year or less 
commercial properties are leased under operating leases to tenants for various terms exceeding one year 
lease terms often include renewal options 
rental revenue is recognized on the straight line basis  which averages minimum required rents over the terms of the leases 
rents recognized in advance of collection are reflected as rent receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts periodically 
in performing our evaluation  our management assesses the recoverability of individual real estate mortgage loans and rent receivables by a comparison of their carrying amount with their estimated net realizable value 
reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenditures are incurred 
we receive payments for these reimbursements from substantially all its 
table of contents multi tenant commercial tenants throughout the year based on estimates 
differences between estimated recoveries and the final billed amounts  which are immaterial  are recognized in the subsequent year 
a number of the commercial leases provide for a base rent plus a percentage rent based on gross sales in excess of a stipulated amount 
these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved and are included in rental income at that time 
profit on sales of real estate shall be recognized in full when the real estate is sold  provided the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured or the amount that will be collectible can be estimated and the seller is not obliged to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit 
any gain or loss on a sale or disposition is recognized in accordance with gaap 
accounting for property owned 
real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation less an adjustment  if any  for impairment 
a land value is assigned based on the purchase price if land is acquired separately or based on market research if acquired in a merger or in a single or portfolio acquisition 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we use a year estimated life for buildings and improvements and a year estimated life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve and or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life  generally five to ten years 
property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers and sufficient consideration has been received by us 
upon disposition  the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts 
any gain or loss on sale is recognized in accordance with gaap 
we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  including our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions  expected holding period of each asset and legal and environmental concerns 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
if indicators exist  we compare the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long lived asset against the carrying amount of that asset 
if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss would be recorded for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset 
the fair value of the property is the amount that would be recoverable upon the disposition of the property 
techniques used to establish fair value include present 
table of contents value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved  the appraised value  and recent sales of comparable assets in close proximity to the trust s property 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  established accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
certain provisions of sfas were amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of statement the impact of sfas is not significant 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  for any guarantees issued or modified after december  fasb interpretation no requires a liability to be recognized upon issuance of certain guarantees  whether or not payment under the guarantee is probable 
it also requires the disclosure of certain information related to new and previously existing guarantees 
we do not believe that we have entered into any guarantees that fall within the guidance of fasb interpretation no 
and  thus  such interpretation has no impact on our financial statements 
we have adopted fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
these consolidation requirements apply to variable interest entities created after january   and to existing variable interest entities beginning august  fasb interpretation no 
requires that a variable interest entity be consolidated if we are subject to a majority of the risk of loss from its activities or are entitled to receive a majority of the entities returns 
we do believe that we have interests in any variable interest entities  and thus  this interpretation has no impact on the our financial statements 
effective may   sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires us to recognize obligations incurred in conjunction with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
it is anticipated that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  effective for activities initiated after december  this standard establishes the need for recognition of liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the adoption of sfas no
