the asset impairment charges in fiscal represented the write down of fixed assets in under performing stores to fair value 
we define comparable store sales as net sales from stores that have been open for more than full months and that have not been substantially remodeled during that time 
for purposes of determining the comparable store sales increase  average net sales per store and average net sales per gross square foot  fiscal results were recalculated based on a week year 
average net sales per store represents net sales from stores open throughout the full period divided by the number of such stores 
average square footage per store represents the square footage of stores open on the last day of the period divided by the number of such stores 
average net sales per gross square foot represents net sales from stores open throughout the full period divided by the gross square footage of such stores 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes thereto included in item the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors 
overview the children s place retail stores  inc is a specialty retailer of apparel and accessories for children from newborn to twelve years of age 
as of april   we operated stores in the united states and canada 
we also sell our merchandise on our website 
during fiscal  we opened new stores  including stores in canada  our first entry into the international marketplace 
we closed three stores in fiscal fiscal was a disappointing year for the children s place 
our net sales in fiscal were million  as compared to net sales of million reported in fiscal we experienced a comparable store sales decline of in fiscal  as compared to an comparable store sales decline during fiscal net income was million in fiscal  or per diluted share  as compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in fiscal our disappointing fiscal earnings resulted from a number of factors 
we believe that our merchandise assortment was too heavily weighted towards fashion and contained an over assortment of styles 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  which encompassed our back to school and holiday seasons  we experienced delays in merchandise receipts  emanating from product shipment delays from our manufacturers  as well as the west coast ports labor dispute 
these shipment delays resulted in a disjointed store presentation and adversely impacted the customer s ability to purchase a coordinated outfit 
in addition  we offered our customers insufficient inventory depth on our basic and for key items 
these challenges were further compounded by the continued weakness in the economy during fiscal  which has created a highly promotional retail environment 
we believe that the weakness in the economy  combined with an increase in the amount of competition  resulted in a narrowing of the gap between our prices and those of our competitors 
as a result of these factors  significant markdowns were taken throughout fiscal as a result of our disappointing performance in fiscal  we recorded a non cash asset impairment charge of million before taxes for the write down of leasehold improvements and fixtures in underperforming stores 
impairment charges were recorded because the cash flow projections for these stores over their remaining lease terms were insufficient to recapture the net book value of their assets 
during fiscal  our effective tax rate increased to from in fiscal our effective tax rate increased in fiscal as a result of losses incurred by our canadian subsidiary for which we did not recognize a tax benefit 
over the last several years  we aggressively opened new stores to capitalize on our attractive store economics 
while we continue to believe that we have the opportunity to increase our store base  in the near term we have decided to slow our growth until we improve our comparable store sales trends and see a sustainable turn in the business 
as a result  our store growth plan in includes opening approximately stores  in the united states and in canada 
we are implementing several strategies to address the challenges we faced in fiscal we are reducing both the number of styles and the number of items offered within our stores  to present our customers with a clear and focused product assortment 
we will also offer a greater percentage of basic items  in an effort to create a better balance between our fashion and basic merchandise 
in addition  the quality of our garments has been and will continue to be enhanced  featuring increased fabric weight on a certain number of our styles and garment washing 
while increasing our quality  we are reducing our prices to an everyday value pricing strategy 
with the inception of our everyday value pricing strategy  we intend to reduce the amount of promotional activity that occurred in fiscal together  these strategies are designed with the goal of creating a strong competitive position within the children s apparel retail market 
during the nine weeks ended april   we experienced a comparable store sales decline  as compared to a comparable store sales decline in the nine weeks ended april  although we believe that we have improved our merchandise offerings  our results for the first nine weeks of were adversely impacted by continued weak consumer confidence  severe winter weather  the timing of the easter holiday and declines in store traffic 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating reported financial results include the following revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at our retail stores or when shipped from our distribution center if the product was purchased from our website 
our policy with respect to gift cards is to record revenue as the gift cards are redeemed for merchandise 
prior to their redemption  gift cards are recorded as a liability 
revenue is deferred for our private label credit card promotions that provide a future discount on purchases once a minimum customer purchase threshold is satisfied 
actual merchandise return rates have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established 
however  in the unlikely event that the actual rate of sales returns by customers increased significantly  our operational results could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market  using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
at any one time  inventories include items that have been marked down to our best estimate of their fair market value 
we base our decision to mark down merchandise based upon its current rate of sale  the season  age and sell through of the item 
to the extent that our estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may have to be recorded  which could reduce our gross margins and operating results 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion taste of our customers and provide a well balanced merchandise assortment that satisfies customer demand 
any inability to provide the proper quantity of appropriate merchandise in a timely manner could increase future markdown rates 
impairment of assets we continually evaluate each store s performance and measure the carrying value of each location s fixed assets  principally leasehold improvements and fixtures  versus its projected cash flows 
an impairment loss is recorded if the projected future cash flows are insufficient to recapture the net book value of their assets 
to the extent our estimates of future cash flows are incorrect  additional impairment charges may be recorded in future periods 
litigation we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business 
in our opinion  any ultimate liability arising out of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
stock options we record no compensation expense on our financial statements for stock based compensation  since we grant stock options at prices that equal or exceed fair market value at the date of the grant 
if the company elects or is required to adopt fair value accounting for its stock based compensation  the related compensation charge will adversely impact net income 
in addition  increases to our stock price would result in more diluted shares outstanding and reduce our diluted net income per common share 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended february  february  february  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses asset impairment charges depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income number of stores  end of period year ended february  compared to year ended february  net sales increased by million or to million during fiscal from million during fiscal net sales for the new stores opened  as well as other stores that did not qualify as comparable stores  contributed million of the net sales increase 
this net sales increase was partially offset by a comparable store sales decline in fiscal  which decreased our net sales by million 
comparable store sales decreased in fiscal during fiscal  our comparable store sales decline resulted from a merchandise mix that was too heavily weighted towards fashion and contained an over assortment of styles and low inventory levels partially caused by late deliveries 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the west coast ports labor dispute also contributed to delivery delays of our holiday lines 
these shipment delays resulted in a disjointed store presentation and adversely impacted the customers ability to purchase a coordinated outfit 
our comparable store sales decline was also unfavorably impacted by a slowdown in store traffic that was caused in part by the difficult economic climate 
as a result  we experienced a lower average transaction size and a lower number of comparable store transactions compared to fiscal in addition  our average retail price was lower as a result of aggressive markdowns taken throughout fiscal  as well as our strategic decision to lower prices in order to be more competitive during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal gross profit decreased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal during fiscal  gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  decreased due to higher occupancy costs and higher markdowns taken to clear merchandise  partially offset by higher initial markup achieved through lower products costs from our manufacturers 
occupancy costs were higher  as a percentage of net sales  due to our comparable store sales decline and increased occupancy costs from new stores that have not been open long enough to leverage their rent through an established sales base 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales during fiscal  as compared with of net sales during fiscal the increase  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily due to higher store payroll  marketing  medical benefit and insurance costs  partially offset by insurance proceeds 
these insurance proceeds approximated million  or of net sales  and resulted primarily from the property damage settlement and a portion of the business interruption claim from our world trade center store and a property damage claim from one of our distribution centers 
during fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million before taxes  or of net sales  for the write down of leasehold improvements and fixtures in underperforming stores 
we determined these assets were impaired as the cash flow projections for these stores over their remaining lease terms were insufficient to recapture the net book value of their assets 
during fiscal  we plan to close a few of these stores 
depreciation and amortization amounted to million  or of net sales  during fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily was a result of our larger store base and increased software amortization  due to a full year of amortization on systems implemented in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded net interest income of million  or of net sales  due to our net cash investment position 
during fiscal  we recorded net interest expense of million  due to borrowings under our working capital facility 
our provision for taxes for fiscal was million  as compared to a million provision in fiscal the decrease in our tax provision was primarily due to our decreased profitability in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared with an effective tax rate of in fiscal our effective tax rate in fiscal increased as a result of losses incurred by our canadian subsidiary for which we did not recognize a tax benefit 
due to the factors discussed above  net income in fiscal decreased to million from million during fiscal year ended february  compared to year ended february  net sales increased by million or to million during fiscal from million during fiscal net sales for the new stores opened  as well as other stores that did not qualify as comparable stores  contributed million of the net sales increase 
this net sales increase was partially offset by an comparable store sales decline in fiscal  which decreased our net sales by million 
comparable store sales increased in fiscal to more closely match the same period last year  comparable stores sales calculations for fiscal have shifted fiscal sales by one week since fiscal was a fifty three week year 
in addition  the extra week in fiscal contributed million to fiscal net sales 
our comparable store sales decline in fiscal was attributable in part to a slowdown in store traffic caused by a weak economic climate 
in addition  sales of our folding yaak scooter contributed million to fiscal sales 
during fiscal  sales of the yaak folding scooter were approximately million 
excluding sales of the yaak folding scooter  comparable store sales decreased during fiscal gross profit increased million to million during fiscal from during fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to during fiscal from during fiscal during fiscal  gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  increased due to higher initial markups achieved through effective product sourcing 
these increases were partially offset by higher occupancy costs and higher markdowns 
occupancy costs were higher  as a percentage of net sales  due to our comparable store sales declines and increased occupancy costs from new stores that have not been open long enough to leverage their rent through an established sales base 
our markdowns were higher  as a percentage of net sales  due to the weak sales environment which was caused in part by a difficult economic climate 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales during fiscal  as compared with of net sales during fiscal the increase  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily due to higher store payroll and medical costs  partially offset by lower marketing costs  and the leveraging of corporate administrative expenses 
in addition  fiscal included certain one time expenses 
depreciation and amortization amounted to million  or of net sales  during fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization primarily was a result of increases to our store base 
interest expense  net  for fiscal was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal the decrease in interest expense  net  was due to lower borrowings under our working capital facility  lower interest rates and interest income recorded on our investments 
our provision for income taxes in fiscal was million  as compared to a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal the increase in our provision for income taxes during fiscal was due to our increased profitability 
our effective tax rate was and  during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
fiscal net income increased to million from million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources debt service liquidity our primary uses of cash are financing new store openings and providing for working capital  which primarily represents the purchase of inventory 
our working capital needs follow a seasonal pattern  peaking during the second and third quarters when inventory is purchased for the back to school and holiday seasons 
we have been able to meet our cash needs principally by using cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our working capital facilities 
as of february   we had no long term debt obligations nor any borrowings on our working capital facility 
during fiscal  our principal working capital facility provided for borrowings up to million including a sublimit for letters of credit of million

our canadian credit facility is currently collateralized to provide for million in borrowings 
as of february   we had no borrowings under our canadian credit facility and had outstanding letters of credit of million

cash flows capital expenditures cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  cash flows from operating activities decreased primarily as a result of lower operating earnings  higher inventory levels and increases in current assets  partially offset by increases in current liabilities 
in fiscal  cash flows from operating activities increased as a result of lower inventory levels and increased operating earnings 
cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities relate primarily to store openings and remodelings 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we opened  and stores while remodeling  and stores  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities in decreased primarily due to capital expenditures made in fiscal to equip and furnish our west coast distribution center 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million in fiscal  reflecting funds received from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases 
in fiscal and fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities reflected the net repayment of borrowings under our working capital facility  offset partially by funds received from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases 
we anticipate that total capital expenditures will approximate million to million in fiscal these expenditures will relate primarily to the opening of approximately stores and store remodels 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from operations and funds available under our working capital facilities will be sufficient to fund our capital and other cash flow requirements for at least the next months 
in addition  we will consider additional sources of financing to fund our long term growth 
our ability to meet our capital requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations and successfully implement our fiscal strategic initiatives 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our contractual and commercial obligations as of february  payments due by period contractual obligations less than dollars in thousands total year years years after years long term debt capital leases operating leases      amounts of commitment expiration per period other commercial total commitments amounts less than dollars in thousands committed year years years after years working capital facility merchandise letters of credit   standby letters of credit   represents letters of credit issued to landlords  banks and insurance companies 
we do not expect a cash outlay for these stand by letters of credit during quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate materially depending on a variety of factors  including overall economic conditions and recession  the timing of new store openings and related pre opening and other startup costs  net sales contributed by new stores  increases or decreases in comparable store sales  weather conditions  shifts in timing of certain holidays  changes in our merchandise mix and pricing strategy 
our business is also subject to seasonal influences  with heavier concentrations of sales during the back to school and holiday seasons 
as is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise  we typically experience lower net sales and net income during the first two fiscal quarters  and net sales and net income are lower during the second fiscal quarter than during the first fiscal quarter 
our first quarter results are heavily dependent upon sales during the period leading up to the easter holiday 
in fiscal  we anticipate that the late timing of the easter holiday will shift our customers purchasing patterns to later on in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of our third quarter results are heavily dependent upon back to school sales and our fourth quarter results are heavily dependent upon sales during the holiday season 
we experienced losses in the second quarter of and the second quarter of and expect to experience a second quarter loss in fiscal it is also possible we could experience losses in other quarters 
because of these fluctuations in net sales and net income loss  the results of operations of any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data and operating data for each of our last eight fiscal quarters
