item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general background and performance measurement the company believes that an important measure of its operating performance is funds from operations ffo 
ffo is defined as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring  sales or write down of assets and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  plus depreciation and amortization excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities 
adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis 
in calculating its ffo  the company excluded minimum rent recognized in pursuant to sfas no 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
ffo  as presented  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts 
for the reconciliation of ffo to net income  see funds from operations 
percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant sales 
as leases roll over  however  a portion of historical percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent

statement on critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec recently issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of these estimates and assumptions include judgements on revenue recognition  estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals  provisions for uncollectable accounts  impairment of long lived assets and estimates for environmental matters 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue recognition minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related lease 
the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the straight lining of rent adjustment 
currently  of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for cpi rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease 
the company believes that using cpi increases  rather than fixed contractual rent increases  results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases 
percentage rents are recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with staff accounting bulletin recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes  insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
property costs related to the development  redevelopment  construction and improvement of properties are capitalized 
interest incurred or imputed on development  redevelopment and construction projects are capitalized until construction is substantially complete 
maintenance and repairs expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
costs for major replacements and betterments  which includes hvac equipment  roofs  parking lots  etc 
are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
realized gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings 
macerich financial statements property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years tenant improvements initial term of related lease equipment and furnishings years the company accounts for all acquisitions entered into subsequent to june  in accordance with sfas the company will determine a fair value for assets and liabilities acquired  which generally consist of land  buildings  acquired in place leases and debt 
acquired in place leases are valued based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in place rates over the remaining lease term 
the fair value of debt is determined based upon the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates for similar debt and the face value of the debt over the remaining term of the debt 
when the company acquires real estate properties  the company allocates the components of these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using its estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions impact the amount of costs allocated between land and different categories of land improvements as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions 
these allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or losses recorded on future sales of properties 
the company assesses whether there has been an impairment in the value of its long lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other economic factors 
such factors include the tenants ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases 
the company may recognize an impairment loss if the income stream is not sufficient to cover its investment 
such a loss would be determined as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a center 
deferred charges costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight line method 
cost relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight line method  which approximates the effective interest method 
the range of the terms of the agreements are as follows deferred lease costs years deferred financing costs years off balance sheet arrangements debt guarantees the company has an ownership interest in a number of joint ventures as detailed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein

the results of these acquisitions are reflected in the consolidated results of operations of the company in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures and the management companies

the company believes that using cpi increases  rather than fixed contractual rent increases  results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases 
the company s historical growth in revenues  net income and funds from operations have been closely tied to the acquisition and redevelopment of shopping centers 
many factors  including the macerich financial statements availability and cost of capital  the company s total amount of debt outstanding  interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets  among others  will affect the company s ability to acquire and redevelop additional properties in the future 
the company may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected in terms of achieving the anticipated financial and operating results 
increased competition for acquisitions may impact adversely the company s ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms 
expenses arising from the company s efforts to complete acquisitions  redevelop properties or increase its market penetration may have an adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the following describes some of the other significant factors that may impact the company s future results of operations 
general factors affecting the centers  competition real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of the centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses  including debt service  lease payments  capital expenditures and tenant improvements  and to make distributions to the company and the company s stockholders 
income from shopping center properties may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the national economic climate  the regional and local economy which may be adversely impacted by plant closings  industry slowdowns  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  terrorist activities  and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of  or a reduction in demand for  retail space or retail goods and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants  perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the shopping center  and increased costs of maintenance  insurance and operations including real estate taxes 
a significant percentage of the centers are located in california and the westcor centers are concentrated in arizona 
to the extent that economic or other factors affect california or arizona or their respective regions generally more severely than other areas of the country  the negative impact on the company s economic performance could be significant 
there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with the centers in attracting tenants to lease space  and an increasing number of new retail formats and technologies other than retail shopping centers that compete with the centers for retail sales see business competition 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s revenues 
income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by such factors as applicable laws and regulations  including tax  environmental  safety and zoning laws see business environmental matters  interest rate levels and the availability and cost of financing 
dependence on tenants the company s revenues and funds available for distribution would be adversely affected if a significant number of the company s lessees were unable due to poor operating results  bankruptcy  terrorist activities or other reasons to meet their obligations  if the company were unable to lease a significant amount of space in the centers on economically favorable terms  or if for any reason  the company were unable to collect a significant amount of rental payments 
a decision by a department store or another significant tenant to cease operations at a center could also have an adverse effect on the company 
in addition  mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  dispositions or bankruptcies in the retail industry could result in the loss of tenants at one or more centers 
see business bankruptcy and or closure of retail stores 
furthermore  if the store sales of retailers operating in the centers were to decline sufficiently  tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges 
in the event of a default by a lessee  the center may also experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor 
macerich financial statements real estate development risks through the company s acquisition of westcor  its business strategy has expanded to include the selective development and construction of retail properties 
any development  redevelopment and construction activities that the company undertakes will be subject to the risks of real estate development  including lack of financing  construction delays  environmental requirements  budget overruns  sunk costs and lease up 
furthermore  occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable 
real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain  or delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
if any of the above events occur  the ability to pay distributions and service the company s indebtedness could be adversely affected
