item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information  the discussion in this annual report contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under factors that may affect future results below and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company with growing revenue from sales of our first product  angiomax  a direct thrombin inhibitor used as an anticoagulant in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty 
the fda approved angiomax for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing coronary angioplasty in december  and we began selling the product in the united states in january our total net revenue was million in and million in  generated almost entirely from sales of angiomax in the united states 
since our inception we have generated significant losses 
we expect to continue to spend significant amounts on the development of our products and on the sales and marketing of angiomax in and thereafter 
in  we plan on increasing our sales and marketing expenses by approximately  in connection with anticipated increased customer demands  including expenses related to a planned increase in the size of our sales force from to persons 
we also plan to continue to invest in clinical studies to expand the use of angiomax and to develop new products 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of development stage or approved products that would fit within our growth strategy 
accordingly  we will need to generate significantly greater revenues to achieve and then maintain profitability 
since the announcement of the results of our replace clinical trial  additional hospitals have granted angiomax formulary approval and hospital demand for the product has increased  and we expect that these trends will continue 
in the fourth quarter of  based on data obtained from an industry third party  the number of hospitals purchasing angiomax increased by approximately as compared to the third quarter of and the number of hospitals purchasing four or more boxes of angiomax increased by approximately as compared to the third quarter of most of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities and selling  general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses represent costs incurred for product acquisition  clinical trials  activities relating to regulatory filings and manufacturing development efforts 
we outsource our clinical trials and manufacturing development activities to independent organizations to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  general corporate activities and costs associated with promotion and marketing activities 
in connection with our initial public offering  during the year ended december   we recorded deferred stock compensation on the grant of stock options of approximately million  representing the difference between the exercise price of such options and the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant of such options 
the exercise prices of these options were below the estimated fair market value of our common stock as of the date of grant based on the estimated price of our common stock in our initial public offering 
no additional deferred compensation was recorded during and because all of the exercise prices of all grants of stock options during this period were at the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we have not generated taxable income to date 
at december   net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal income tax purposes were approximately million 
if not utilized  federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in and ending in we have not recognized the potential tax benefit of our net operating losses in our balance sheets or statements of operations 
the future utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited based upon changes in ownership pursuant to regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
application of critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in addition  our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 
we regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have had a material effect on the presentation of financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
our management has discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition and inventory described below fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition product sales 
we sell our products primarily to wholesalers and distributors  who  in turn  sell to hospitals 
we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  including the guidance in staff accounting bulletin revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
however  because our products are sold with limited rights of return  our recognition of revenue from product sales is also subject to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists 
under sfas  revenue is recognized when the price to the buyer is fixed  the buyer is obligated to pay us and the obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer has economic substance apart from us  we have no obligation to bring about the sale of the product and the amount of returns can be reasonably estimated 
we record allowances for product returns  rebates and discounts at the time of sale  and report revenue net of such allowances 
we must make significant judgments and estimates in determining these allowances 
if actual results differ  we will likely be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future our customers have the right to return any unopened product with less than six months to the labeled expiration date  provided that the product is returned within months of the labeled expiration date 
as a result  we must estimate the likelihood that product sold to wholesalers might remain in their inventory to within six months of expiration  and whether the wholesalers might decide to return the product 
we base our estimates on information from customers  industry data  historic patterns of returns and on the expiration dates of product being shipped 
certain hospitals purchasing our products from wholesalers have the right to receive a discounted price and a volume based rebate if they participate in a group purchasing organization that has a contract with us 
we must estimate the likelihood that product sold to wholesalers might be ultimately sold to a participating hospital 
we base our estimates on information from customers  industry data  historic patterns of discounts and customer rebate thresholds 
collaborations 
revenue from collaborative agreements with partners may include non refundable fees or milestone payments 
we record these payments as deferred revenue until contractual performance obligations have been satisfied  and we recognize these payments ratably over the term of these agreements 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  we must estimate the period based upon other critical factors contained within the contract 
we review these estimates at least annually  which could result in a change in the deferral period 
inventories we record inventory upon the transfer of title from our vendors 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value with cost determined using a weighted average of costs 
we expensed all costs associated with the manufacture of angiomax bulk drug product and finished product to which the title transferred to us prior to fda approval of angiomax and of its original manufacturing process as research and development 
in december  we received fda approval for angiomax and its original manufacturing process 
any angiomax bulk drug product manufactured according to its original manufacturing process to which we took title after fda approval is recorded as inventory 
together with ucb bioproducts  we have developed  but not yet received fda approval of  a second generation chemical synthesis process  the chemilog process  for the manufacture of angiomax bulk drug substance 
all angiomax bulk drug product manufactured using the chemilog process to which we have taken title to date has been expensed as research and development 
we review the inventory for slow moving or obsolete amounts based on expected revenues 
if actual revenues are less than expected  we may be required to make allowances for excess amounts in the future 
results of operations years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue increased to million in as compared to million for virtually all the revenue was from us sales of angiomax  which we commercially launched during the first quarter of the growth in was due primarily to increased use of angiomax by existing hospital customers and penetration to new hospitals 
since we announced the results of replace in november  additional hospitals have granted angiomax formulary approval and hospital demand for the product has increased 
in  we received million from nycomed as a non refundable distributor fee 
this payment has been recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized ratably over the term of our agreement with nycomed  which we currently estimate to be twelve years 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue in was million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue in cost of revenue in consisted of expenses in connection with the manufacture of the angiomax sold  which represented of the cost of revenue  royalty expenses under our agreement with biogen which represented of the cost of revenue and the logistics costs of selling angiomax  such as distribution  storage  and handling  which represented of the cost of revenue 
prior to obtaining fda approval for angiomax and its original manufacturing process  all costs of manufacturing angiomax were expensed as research and development costs 
in late  after obtaining fda approval for angiomax and its original manufacturing process  we began recording the costs of manufacturing angiomax as a cost of revenue rather than as research and development expense 
as a result  our cost of manufacturing as a percentage of net revenue increased substantially in as we sold a higher percentage of product manufactured after the date of fda approval of angiomax 
during  we took delivery of drug material manufactured using the chemilog process  which we expensed as research and development 
the chemilog process must be approved by the fda before it can be used to produce angiomax for sale to the public 
since the chemilog process has not yet received fda approval  we have expensed all costs of manufacturing angiomax using the chemilog process as research and development 
if we receive fda approval of the chemilog process by july  we expect to begin selling in the third or fourth quarter of angiomax produced by the chemilog process whose cost of manufacturing was previously expensed 
as a result  we expect our cost of manufacturing as a percentage of product revenue will remain at current levels early in the year and then  subject to fda approval of the chemilog process  decrease substantially by the end of we have partially funded development activities relating to the chemilog process  paying total development expenses through december  of approximately million  which includes validation and process batch costs of approximately million and million incurred in and  respectively  and approximately  of other development costs 
we expensed all of these development costs as research and development in the appropriate period 
subject to fda approval of the chemilog process  we expect to be able to sell the validation and process batches of angiomax produced using the chemilog process 
we are committed to purchase during approximately million of additional drug material manufactured using the chemilog process 
to the extent ucb bioproducts transfers title to this drug material to us prior to fda approval of the chemilog process  we will expense these costs as research and development 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for  from million for over ninety percent of the expenses related to angiomax development activities  of which sixty percent were associated with replace the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher clinical development costs of million relating to our replace trial and million in higher manufacturing development cost incurred in connection with our receipts of angiomax manufactured using the chemilog process 
these higher costs were partly offset by the absence of clinical development costs of the hero trial program  our phase trial of angiomax in ami  that we completed in  and other development programs savings 
we have a number of clinical trial programs currently underway  or about to commence  for expanding the applications of angiomax for use as an intravenous anticoagulant in the treatment of arterial thrombosis 
the funding for angiomax  our main product  has represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of research and development spending 
for and  research and development expenses related to angiomax included the costs of clinical trials  development manufacturing costs for the bulk drug product and the cost associated with preparation of us and worldwide marketing applications 
the amount of future research and development expenses associated with angiomax are not reasonably certain as these costs are dependent upon the regulatory process and the timing for obtaining marketing approval for other applications of the product in the united states and other countries 
we currently plan to expend approximately million to million on research and development in  of which about is planned for angiomax 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for  from million for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  was primarily due to additional sales expense related to the promotion of angiomax  offset in part by lower marketing expenses 
noncash stock compensation 
we amortize the deferred stock compensation that was recorded in over the respective vesting periods of the individual stock options 
we recorded amortization expense for deferred compensation of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect to record amortization expense for the deferred compensation of approximately million in and approximately  in in  we accelerated the vesting of stock options held by terminated employees in connection with their termination agreements  which resulted in  in non cash compensation expense 
the amortization and non cash compensation expense is included in our operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
other income and expense 
interest income decreased to  for  from million for the decrease in interest income of million was primarily due to lower cash and available for sale securities balances and lower available interest rates on securities 
for  interest income was attributable to the investment of the remaining proceeds of our sales of shares of common stock in a private placement in may and in a public offering in in  interest income was primarily attributable to the investment of the remaining proceeds of our initial public offering in august and september we had interest expense of  during associated with the draw down of our revolving line of credit at the end of march we terminated the revolving line of credit in august we had no interest expense for in  we liquidated our million principal investment in southern california edison bonds  recognizing a loss of  on the sale 
years ended december  and net revenue 
we had net revenue of million in from sales of angiomax 
we had no net revenue in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue in was million  or of net revenue 
the cost of revenue in consisted of expenses in connection with the manufacture of the angiomax sold which represented of the cost of revenue  the logistics costs of selling angiomax such as distribution  storage  and handling  which represented of the cost of revenue  and royalty expenses under our agreements with biogen which represented of the cost of revenue 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in eighty eight percent of the expenditures related to angiomax development activities  of which were associated with replace and were related to our hero trial program 
the decrease in research and development expenses of million was primarily due to higher manufacturing development costs related to ucb bioproduct s manufacture of angiomax bulk drug product in  which was expensed prior to fda approval  and to lower clinical development costs associated with the completion in of the hero trial program  our phase clinical trial in ami 
partly offsetting this decrease in research and development costs were higher costs related to our trials in angioplasty called replace and replace and higher development costs related to the chemilog process 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million was primarily due to an increase in marketing and selling expenses and corporate infrastructure costs arising from an increase in activity relating to the commercial launch of angiomax in  including the addition of sales personnel 
other income and expense 
interest income increased to million in from million in the increase in interest income of  was primarily due to interest income arising from the investment of the proceeds of our initial public offering in august and september and from the investment of the proceeds from our sale of million shares of our common stock in a private placement in may we had no interest expense in interest expense of million in was related to interest charges and amortization of the discount on our convertible notes issued in october and march during the second quarter of  we liquidated our million principal investment in southern california edison bonds  recognizing a loss of  on the sale 
noncash stock compensation 
we amortize the deferred stock compensation that was recorded in over the respective vesting periods of the individual stock options 
we recorded amortization expense for deferred compensation of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amortization expense is included in our operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity 
since our inception  we have financed our operations through the sale of common and preferred stock  sales of convertible promissory notes and warrants  interest income and revenues from sales of angiomax 
in august and september  we received million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering 
since our initial public offering  we have received an additional million in net proceeds in may from the sale of million shares of our common stock in a private placement and million in net proceeds in june from the sale of million shares of our common stock in a public offering 
prior to our initial public offering  we had received net proceeds of million from the private placement of equity securities  primarily redeemable convertible preferred stock  and million from the issuance of convertible notes and warrants 
in march  we entered into a collaboration agreement with nycomed 
under the agreement  nycomed paid us an initial non refundable fee of million and agreed to pay up to million in additional milestones based on regulatory approvals in europe 
in addition  nycomed purchased  shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of approximately million 
in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement with comerica bank california 
the agreement allowed us to borrow up to million 
the agreement was terminated in august on march   we filed a registration statement on form s which registered  shares of our common stock under the securities act for sale to the public 
assuming an offering price of per share  proceeds to us would be approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and all estimated offering expenses payable by us 
we have also granted the underwriters of the offering an option to purchase up to  additional shares of common stock 
if the underwriters were to exercise this option  the proceeds to us from the offering would be approximately million 
we anticipate using the net proceeds from this offering as follows to fund further clinical development and commercialization of angiomax  to fund research and development of clevidipine  and to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes 
we also may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire additional products consistent with our strategy  although we have not allocated any portion of the net proceeds for any specific acquisition 
we cannot provide any assurance as to when or if we will close this offering 
cash flows 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million as of december  the major uses of cash during include net cash used for operating activities of million and net cash used in investing activities of million  partly offset by million received from financing activities 
we used net cash of million in operating activities during this use of cash consisted of a net loss of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in accounts payable of  partly offset by a decrease in inventory of million and increases in accrued expenses of million  deferred revenue of million  non cash stock compensation of million  and depreciation of  the increase in accounts receivable can be attributed to the higher sales levels 
during  we used million in cash in net investing activities  which consisted principally of the purchase of available for sale securities 
cash provided by financing activities of million during consisted primarily of the proceeds of the public offering of million shares of our common stock in june which resulted in net proceeds of million 
in addition  nycomed purchased  shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of approximately million and employees purchased stock related to option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan for aggregate net proceeds to us of approximately million 
funding requirements 
we expect to devote substantial resources to our research and development efforts and to our sales  marketing and manufacturing programs associated with the commercialization of our products 
our funding requirements will depend on numerous factors including whether angiomax is commercially successful  the progress  level and timing of our research and development activities related to our additional clinical trials with respect to angiomax and to our other product candidates  the cost and outcomes of regulatory reviews  the continuation or termination of third party manufacturing or sales and marketing arrangements  the cost and effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs  the status of competitive products  our ability to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights  and the establishment of additional strategic or licensing arrangements with other companies or acquisitions 
we believe  based on our operating plan as of the date of this annual report  which includes anticipated revenues from angiomax and interest income  and the estimated proceeds of million from the offering of our common stock  that our current cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
however  we expect to periodically assess our financing alternatives and access the capital markets opportunistically 
in addition  if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements due to slower than anticipated revenues from angiomax or otherwise  or if we acquire additional product candidates  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or seek additional financing through other arrangements 
any sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
contractual obligations our long term contractual commitments consist of operating leases for our facilities in parsippany  new jersey and cambridge  massachusetts  which expire in january and august  respectively 
future annual minimum payments under these operating leases are minimum operating lease obligation year s amount later years  total operating lease obligation  in addition to amounts accrued or payable as of december   we have commitments to make payments to ucb bioproducts of a total of million during for angiomax bulk drug substance to be produced using the chemilog process 
we also have million in contractual commitments for related to research and development activities 
factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein regarding our strategy  future operations  financial position  future revenues  projected costs  prospects  plans and objectives of management  other than statements of historical facts  are forward looking statements 
the words anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  may  plans  projects  will  would and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements  although not all forward looking statements contain these identifying words 
we cannot guarantee that we actually will achieve the plans  intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that cause actual results or events to differ materially from those disclosed in the forward looking statements we make 
these important factors include our critical accounting estimates and the risk factors set forth below 
although we may elect to update forward looking statements in the future  we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so  even if our estimates change  and readers should not rely on those forward looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this annual report 
risks related to our business we have a history of net losses  and we expect to continue to incur additional net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability we have incurred net losses since our inception  including net losses of approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize our products  including costs and expenses associated with clinical trials  regulatory approval and commercialization 
we will need to generate significantly greater revenues to achieve and then maintain profitability 
however  we remain unsure as to when we will become profitable  if at all 
and  if we do become profitable  we may not remain profitable for any substantial period of time 
if we fail to achieve profitability within the time frame expected by investors or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock may decline 
our business is very dependent on the commercial success of angiomax angiomax is our only commercial product and  we expect  will account for almost all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
the commercial success of angiomax will depend upon its acceptance by regulators  physicians  patients and other key decision makers as a safe  therapeutic and cost effective alternative to heparin and other products used in current practice  or currently being developed 
if angiomax is not commercially successful  we will have to find additional sources of funding or curtail or cease operations 
near term growth in our sales of angiomax is highly dependent on physician acceptance of the replace trial in the fall of  we completed a  patient post marketing phase b clinical trial of angiomax in coronary angioplasty called replace in november  the principal investigators of the clinical trial announced that  based on day patient follow up results  angiomax met all of the primary and secondary objectives of the trial 
we believe that the near term commercial success of angiomax will depend upon the extent to which physicians  patients and other key decision makers accept the results of the replace trial 
since the results were announced  additional hospitals have granted angiomax formulary approval and hospital demand for the product has increased 
we cannot be certain  however  that these trends will continue 
some commentators have challenged various aspects of the trial design of replace  the conduct of the study and the analysis and interpretation of the results from the study  including how we define bleeding and the clinical relevance of types of ischemic events 
if physicians  patients and other key decision makers do not accept the trial results  adoption of angiomax may suffer  and our business will be materially adversely affected 
we are continuing to follow the patients involved in the replace trial for six month and one year follow up periods and are conducting a detailed cost analysis study to examine per patient total hospital resource consumption at us clinical trial sites 
if the extended follow up data are less favorable than the day patient follow up data announced to date  or if the cost analysis is less favorable than we expect  physician adoption of angiomax may be adversely affected 
we cannot expand the indications for which we are marketing angiomax unless we receive fda approval for each additional indication 
failure to expand these indications will limit the size of the commercial market for angiomax in december  we received approval from the fda for the use of angiomax as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing coronary angioplasty 
one of our key objectives is to expand the indications for which angiomax is approved for marketing by the fda 
in order to market angiomax for these expanded indications  we will need to complete our clinical trials that are currently underway  conduct additional clinical trials  obtain positive results from those trials and obtain fda approval for such proposed indications 
if we are unsuccessful in expanding the approved indications for the use of angiomax  the size of the commercial market for angiomax will be limited 
if we do not succeed in obtaining timely approval for a second generation process for the production of angiomax bulk drug substance  we may not be able to supply our customers all angiomax bulk drug substance used to date has been produced by ucb bioproducts by means of a chemical synthesis process 
using this validated manufacturing process  ucb bioproducts has completed the manufacture of bulk drug substance to meet our anticipated commercial supply requirements through the third quarter of as of the date of this annual report  we do not intend to purchase any additional product manufactured using this process 
we have developed  with ucb bioproducts  a second generation process for the production of angiomax bulk drug substance  which is referred to as the chemilog process 
this process involves changes to the early manufacturing steps of our current process and  we expect  will reduce our angiomax manufacturing costs in the future 
we received approvable letters from the fda with respect to the chemilog process on march  and december  in august  we responded to the march approvable letter 
in the december approvable letter to us and in a corresponding letter to ucb bioproducts  the fda requested additional data 
in february  we submitted what we believe to be the additional data requested by the fda from us 
concurrently  ucb bioproducts submitted what we believe to be the additional data requested by the fda from ucb bioproducts 
if the fda does not approve the chemilog process by july  we would expect to consider purchasing additional product produced using our current process  but potentially on less favorable terms 
this product would likely not be available for a significant period of time  and we could be forced to reject or limit customer orders for angiomax until such product is available 
in such event  sales of angiomax would suffer and our business would be materially adversely affected 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing angiomax abroad we intend to market angiomax through distribution partners in international markets  including europe 
in order to market angiomax in the european union and many other foreign jurisdictions  we or our distribution partners must obtain separate regulatory approvals 
obtaining foreign approvals may require additional trials and expense 
in february  we submitted a maa to the emea for use of angiomax in unstable angina patients undergoing coronary angioplasty 
following extended interaction with european regulatory authorities  the cpmp of the emea voted in october not to recommend angiomax for approval in coronary angioplasty 
we withdrew our application to the emea in and  as of the date of this annual report  plan to resubmit an maa with the results of the replace trial 
we may not be able to obtain approval or may be delayed in obtaining approval from any or all of the jurisdictions in which we seek approval to market angiomax 
the development and commercialization of our products may be terminated or delayed  and the costs of development and commercialization may increase  if third parties who we rely on to manufacture and support the development and commercialization of our products do not fulfill their obligations our development and commercialization strategy entails entering into arrangements with corporate and academic collaborators  contract research organizations  distributors  third party manufacturers  licensors  licensees and others to conduct development work  manage our clinical trials  manufacture our products and market and sell our products outside of the united states 
we do not have the expertise or the resources to conduct such activities on our own and  as a result  are particularly dependent on third parties in most areas 
we may not be able to maintain our existing arrangements with respect to the commercialization of angiomax or establish and maintain arrangements to develop and commercialize clevidipine or any additional product candidates or products we may acquire on terms that are acceptable to us 
any current or future arrangements for development and commercialization may not be successful 
if we are not able to establish or maintain agreements relating to angiomax  clevidipine or any additional products we may acquire on terms which we deem favorable  our results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
third parties may not perform their obligations as expected 
the amount and timing of resources that third parties devote to developing  manufacturing and commercializing our products are not within our control 
furthermore  our interests may differ from those of third parties that manufacture or commercialize our products 
disagreements that may arise with these third parties could delay or lead to the termination of the development or commercialization of our product candidates  or result in litigation or arbitration  which would be time consuming and expensive 
if any third party that manufactures or supports the development or commercialization of our products breaches or terminates its agreement with us  or fails to conduct its activities in a timely manner  such breach  termination or failure could delay or otherwise adversely impact the development or commercialization of angiomax  clevidipine  our other product candidates or any additional product candidates that we may acquire or develop  require us to undertake unforeseen additional responsibilities or devote unforeseen additional resources to the development or commercialization of our products  or result in the termination of the development or commercialization of our products 
failure to raise additional funds in the future may affect the development  manufacture and sale of our products our operations to date have generated a substantial need for cash  and this negative cash flow from operations may persist 
our ability to generate positive operating cash flow is highly dependent on our ability to achieve our revenue targets 
the clinical development and regulatory approval of angiomax for additional indications  the clinical development and regulatory approval of clevidipine and the acquisition and development of additional product candidates by us will require a commitment of substantial funds 
our future capital requirements are dependent upon many factors and may be significantly greater than we expect 
as of the date of this annual report  we believe  based on our current operating plan  which includes anticipated revenues from angiomax and interest income  and the estimated proceeds of million from the offering of shares of our common stock  that our current cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements due to slower than anticipated sales of angiomax or otherwise  or if we acquire additional product candidates  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or seek additional financing through other arrangements 
any sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
in addition  in order to obtain additional financing  we may be required to relinquish rights to products  product candidates or technologies that we would not otherwise relinquish 
we depend on a single supplier for the production of angiomax bulk drug substance and a different single supplier to carry out all fill finish activities for angiomax we do not manufacture any of our products and do not plan to develop any capacity to manufacture them 
as of the date of this annual report  we obtain all of our angiomax bulk drug substance from one manufacturer  ucb bioproducts  and rely on another manufacturer  ben venue laboratories  to carry out all fill finish activities for angiomax  which includes final formulation and transfer of the drug into vials where it is then freeze dried and sealed 
the terms of our agreement with ucb bioproducts require us to purchase a substantial portion of our angiomax bulk drug product from ucb bioproducts which could hinder our ability to obtain an additional supplier for angiomax 
the fda requires that all manufacturers of pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the united states achieve and maintain compliance with the fda s cgmp regulations and guidelines 
there are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cgmp regulations capable of manufacturing angiomax 
as of the date of this annual report  we do not have alternative sources for production of angiomax bulk drug substance or to carry out fill finish activities 
in the event that either of our current manufacturers is unable to carry out its respective manufacturing obligations  we may be unable to obtain alternative manufacturing  or obtain such manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis 
if we were required to transfer manufacturing processes to other third party manufacturers  we would be required to satisfy various regulatory requirements  which could cause us to experience significant delays in receiving an adequate supply of angiomax 
any delays in the manufacturing process may adversely impact our ability to meet commercial demands for angiomax on a timely basis and supply product for clinical trials of angiomax 
we do not own the technology underlying the chemilog process  and may be unable to utilize the chemilog process if ucb bioproducts breaches our agreement our agreement with ucb bioproducts for the supply of angiomax bulk drug substance provides that ucb bioproducts owns all of the proprietary technology that was used to develop and that is employed in the chemilog process 
although the agreement requires that ucb bioproducts transfer this technology to a secondary supplier of angiomax bulk drug substance or to us or an alternate supplier at the expiration of this agreement  if ucb bioproducts fails or is unable to transfer successfully this technology  we would be unable to employ the chemilog process to manufacture our angiomax bulk drug substance  which could increase our manufacturing costs in the future 
clinical trials of our product candidates are expensive and time consuming  and the results of these trials are uncertain before we can obtain regulatory approvals to market any product for a particular indication  we will be required to complete pre clinical studies and extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such product for such indication 
we are evaluating angiomax in clinical trials for additional uses in open vascular surgery such as cabg  in medical conditions that require urgent treatment such as unstable angina  in patients with heparin allergy  in children and in peripheral angioplasty 
there are numerous factors that could delay our clinical trials or prevent us from completing our trials successfully 
we  or the fda  may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks 
the rate of completion of clinical trials depends in part upon the rate of enrollment of patients 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial  the existence of competing clinical trials and the availability of alternative or new treatments 
in particular  the patient population targeted by some of our clinical trials may be small 
delays in future planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and program delays 
in addition  clinical trials  if completed  may not show a product candidate to be safe or effective for the intended use 
results obtained in pre clinical studies or early clinical trials are not always indicative of results that will be obtained in later clinical trials 
moreover  data obtained from pre clinical studies and clinical trials may be subject to varying interpretations 
as a result  the fda or other applicable regulatory authorities may not approve a product in a timely fashion  or at all 
even if regulatory approval to market a product is granted  the regulatory approval may impose limitations on the indicated use for which the product may be marketed 
our failure to acquire and develop additional product candidates or approved products will impair our ability to grow as part of our growth strategy  we intend to acquire and develop additional product candidates or approved products 
the success of this strategy depends upon our ability to identify  select and acquire pharmaceutical products that meet the criteria we have established 
because we neither have  nor intend to establish  internal scientific research capabilities  we are dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other researchers to sell or license product candidates to us 
any product candidate we acquire will require additional research and development efforts prior to commercial sale  including extensive pre clinical and or clinical testing and approval by the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities 
all product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that the product candidate will not be safe  non toxic and effective or approved by regulatory authorities 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any approved products that we develop or acquire will be manufactured or produced economically  successfully commercialized  or widely accepted in the marketplace 
in addition  proposing  negotiating and implementing an economically viable acquisition is a lengthy and complex process 
other companies  including those with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  may compete with us for the acquisition of product candidates and approved products 
we may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates and approved products on terms that we find acceptable  or at all 
a breach of any of the agreements under which we license commercialization rights to products or technology from others  could cause us to lose license rights that are important to our business or subject us to claims by our licensors we license rights to products and technology that are important to our business  and we expect to enter into additional licenses in the future 
for instance  we have exclusively licensed the patents and patent applications relating to angiomax from biogen 
under our agreement with biogen  we are subject to commercialization and development  sublicensing  royalty  patent prosecution and maintenance  insurance and other obligations 
if we exercise our option to acquire an exclusive license to clevidipine from astrazeneca  we will be subject to similar obligations with respect to clevidipine 
any failure by us to comply with any of these obligations or any other breach by us of these license agreements could give the licensor the right to terminate the license in whole  terminate the exclusive nature of the license or bring a claim against us for damages 
any such termination or claim  particularly relating to our agreement with biogen  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
even if we contest any such termination or claim and are ultimately successful  our stock price could suffer 
in addition  upon any termination of a license agreement  we may be required to license to the licensor any related intellectual property that we developed 
we may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and consultants our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years 
we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for the acquisition  development and commercialization activities we conduct or sponsor 
if we lose one or more of the members of our senior management  including our executive chairman  dr 
clive a 
meanwell  or our chief executive officer  david m 
stack  or other key employees or consultants  our ability to implement successfully our business strategy could be seriously harmed 
our ability to replace these key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop and commercialize products successfully 
competition to hire from this limited pool is intense  and we may be unable to hire  train  retain or motivate such additional personnel 
because the market for thrombin inhibitors is competitive  our product may not obtain widespread use we have positioned angiomax as a replacement for heparin  which is a widely used  inexpensive  generic drug used in patients with arterial thrombosis 
because heparin is inexpensive and has been widely used for many years  physicians and medical decision makers may be hesitant to adopt angiomax 
in addition  due to the high incidence and severity of cardiovascular diseases  competition in the market for thrombin inhibitors is intense and growing 
there are a number of direct and indirect thrombin inhibitors currently on the market  awaiting regulatory approval and in development  including orally administered agents 
the thrombin inhibitors on the market include products for use in the treatment of patients with a clinical condition known as hit hitts  patients with unstable angina and patients with deep vein thrombosis 
angiomax may compete with all groups of anticoagulant drugs  including platelet inhibitors and fibrinolytic drugs  which may limit the use of angiomax in general  anticoagulant drugs may be classified into four groups drugs that directly target and inhibit thrombin  drugs that indirectly target and inhibit thrombin  drugs that target and inhibit platelets and drugs that break down fibrin 
because each group of anticoagulants acts on different components of the clotting process  we believe that there will be continued clinical work to determine the best combination of drugs for clinical use 
we expect angiomax to be used with aspirin alone or in conjunction with platelet inhibitors or fibrinolytic drugs 
although platelet inhibitors and fibrinolytic drugs may be complementary to angiomax  we recognize that angiomax may compete with these and other anticoagulant drugs to the extent angiomax and any of these anticoagulant drugs are approved for the same indication 
in addition  platelet inhibitors and fibrinolytic drugs may compete with angiomax for the use of hospital financial resources 
for example  many us hospitals receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for the angioplasties and other treatment therapies they perform 
because this amount is not based on the actual expenses the hospital incurs  hospitals may be forced to use either angiomax or platelet inhibitors or fibrinolytic drugs but not necessarily several of the drugs together 
we face substantial competition  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do our industry is highly competitive 
our success will depend on our ability to acquire and develop products and apply technology  and our ability to establish and maintain markets for our products 
potential competitors in the united states and other countries include major pharmaceutical and chemical companies  specialized pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms  universities and other research institutions 
many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience  and greater manufacturing  marketing and financial resources  than we do 
accordingly  our competitors may develop or license products or other novel technologies that are more effective  safer or less costly than existing products or technologies or products or technologies that are being developed by us or may obtain fda approval for products more rapidly than we are able 
technological development by others may render our products or product candidates noncompetitive 
we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining technological competitiveness 
fluctuations in our operating results could affect the price of our common stock our operating results may vary from period to period based on the amount and timing of sales of angiomax  the availability and timely delivery of a sufficient supply of angiomax  the timing and expenses of clinical trials  announcements regarding clinical trial results and product introductions by us or our competitors  the availability and timing of third party reimbursement and the timing of regulatory approvals 
if our operating results do not match the expectations of securities analysts and investors as a result of these and other factors  the trading price of our common stock will likely decrease 
we may undertake strategic acquisitions in the future and any difficulties from integrating such acquisitions could damage our ability to attain or maintain profitability we may acquire additional businesses and products that complement or augment our existing business 
integrating any newly acquired business or product could be expensive and time consuming 
we may not be able to integrate any acquired business or product successfully or operate any acquired business profitably 
moreover  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to acquire any businesses  which may result in dilution for stockholders and the incurrence of indebtedness 
our revenues are substantially dependent on a limited number of wholesalers to which we sell angiomax  and such revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the buying patterns of these wholesalers we sell angiomax primarily to a limited number of national medical and pharmaceutical distributors and wholesalers with distribution centers located throughout the united states 
during the year ended december   revenues from the sale of angiomax to three wholesalers totaled approximately of our net revenues 
our reliance on this small number of wholesalers could cause our revenues to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the buying patterns of these wholesalers 
in addition  if any of these wholesalers fail to pay us on a timely basis or at all  our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
risks related to our industry if we do not obtain fda approvals for our products or comply with government regulations  we may not be able to market our products and may be subject to stringent penalties except for angiomax  which has been approved for sale in the united states for use as an anticoagulant in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty and which has been approved for sale in canada  israel and new zealand for indications similar to those approved by the fda  we do not have a product approved for sale in the united states or any foreign market 
we must obtain approval from the fda in order to sell our product candidates in the united states and from foreign regulatory authorities in order to sell our product candidates in other countries 
we must successfully complete our clinical trials and demonstrate manufacturing capability before we can file with the fda for approval to sell our products 
the fda could require us to repeat clinical trials as part of the regulatory review process 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals may delay or prevent the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates  diminish our competitive advantage  and defer or decrease our receipt of revenues or royalties 
the regulatory review and approval process is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
extensive pre clinical data  clinical data and supporting information must be submitted to the fda for each additional indication to obtain such approvals  and we cannot be certain when we will receive these regulatory approvals  if ever 
in addition to initial regulatory approval  our product and product candidates will be subject to extensive and rigorous ongoing domestic and foreign government regulation of  among other things  the research  development  testing  manufacture  labeling  promotion  advertising  distribution and marketing of our products and product candidates 
any approvals  once obtained  may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or safety problems are identified 
failure to comply with these requirements may also subject us to stringent penalties 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain patent protection for our products  and we may infringe the patent rights of others the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal  scientific and factual issues 
our success depends significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain us and foreign patents  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights 
we may not have any patents issued from any patent applications that we own or license 
if patents are granted  the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  issued patents that we own or license may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology 
because patent applications in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that others have not filed or maintained patent applications for technology used by us or covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of these applications 
we exclusively license us patents and patent applications and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications relating to angiomax from biogen 
as of the date of this annual report  we exclusively license six issued us patents relating to angiomax 
the principal us patent that covers angiomax expires in the us patent and trademark office has rejected our application for an extension of the term of the patent beyond because the application was not filed on time 
we are exploring an alternative to extend the term of the patent  but we can provide no assurance that we will be successful 
we have not yet filed any independent patent applications 
we may not hold proprietary rights to some patents related to our product candidates 
in some cases  others may own or control these patents 
as a result  we may be required to obtain licenses under third party patents to market some of our product candidates 
if licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms  we will not be able to market these products 
we may become a party to patent litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
if any patent litigation or other intellectual property proceeding in which we are involved is resolved unfavorably to us  we may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling our products without a license from the other party  and we may be held liable for significant damages 
we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to keep our trade secrets confidential  our technology and information may be used by others to compete against us we rely significantly upon unpatented proprietary technology  information  processes and know how 
we seek to protect this information by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and other third party contractors  as well as through other security measures 
we may not have adequate remedies for any breach by a party to these confidentiality agreements 
in addition  our competitors may learn or independently develop our trade secrets 
we could be exposed to significant liability claims if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable costs and adequate levels or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of human healthcare products 
product liability claims might be made by patients in clinical trials  consumers  health care providers or pharmaceutical companies or others that sell our products 
these claims may be made even with respect to those products that are manufactured in licensed and regulated facilities or otherwise possess regulatory approval for commercial sale 
these claims could expose us to significant liabilities that could prevent or interfere with the development or commercialization of our products 
product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or pay significant damages 
as of the date of this annual report  we are covered  with respect to our commercial sales in the united states  israel and new zealand and our clinical trials  by primary product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and million annually in the aggregate on a claims made basis 
this coverage may not be adequate to cover any product liability claims 
as we commercialize our products  we may wish to increase our product liability insurance 
product liability coverage is expensive 
in the future  we may not be able to maintain or obtain such product liability insurance on reasonable terms  at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability claims 
our ability to generate future revenue from products will depend on reimbursement and drug pricing acceptable levels of reimbursement of drug treatments by government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize  and attract collaborative partners to invest in the development of  product candidates 
we cannot be sure that reimbursement in the united states or elsewhere will be available for any products we may develop or  if already available  will not be decreased in the future 
if reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels  we may not be able to commercialize our products  and may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on our products 
third party payers increasingly are challenging prices charged for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states and the changes in health insurance programs  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may result in lower prices for pharmaceutical products  including any products that may be offered by us 
cost cutting measures that health care providers are instituting  and the effect of any health care reform  could materially adversely affect our ability to sell any products that are successfully developed by us and approved by regulators 
moreover  we are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
we place our investments in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  corporate debt and us government agency securities with maturities or auction dates of less than one year  which we believe are subject to limited credit risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities  all due within one year  which had an average interest rate of approximately 
most of our transactions are conducted in us dollars 
we do have certain development and commercialization agreements with vendors located outside the united states 
transactions under certain of these agreements are conducted in us dollars  subject to adjustment based on significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
transactions under certain other of these agreements are conducted in the local foreign currency 
if the applicable exchange rate undergoes a change of  we do not believe that it would have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
