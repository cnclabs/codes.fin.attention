results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net revenues 
for the fiscal year ended september   our net revenues decreased  to  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  this revenue decrease is represented by a decrease in airline sales of  to  and in retail and other sales of  to  these decreases were substantially offset by increases in weight loss product sales and foodservice sales of  to  the tragic events of september  have continued to significantly impact our sales to airline related customers 
though the ongoing effect of these events on the airline industry  airline revenues  and on our business in particular  cannot be accurately determined at this time  we are estimating that in the near term  sales to airline customers will experience little to no growth from levels 
sales to pinnacle foods decreased in mid year of fiscal year  resulting in a million reduction in sales to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year also  subsequent to september  the grocery strike in southern california has reduced our sales to the grocery chains involved in the labor dispute 
sales of recurring items to albertson s in the first eleven weeks of fiscal year  september  to december   have fallen by million to million from million during the first eleven weeks of fiscal year  september  to december  these reductions in sales have been partially offset by increases in sales to new and existing retail customers 
gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended september  decreased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  was compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is due largely to manufacturing related inefficiencies encountered in connection with the start up of our new plant and the cost of moving our manufacturing operations into the new facility in fiscal year improvements in gross margins are anticipated as we further realize the cost benefits of the plant consolidation 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended september  increased  to  of net revenues from  of net revenues in the prior fiscal year 
contributing factors to this increase in sg a were increases in new product demonstration costs for our chicago brothers brand products for retail customers  professional fees  including accounting  audit and one time consulting fees related to the april refinancing  compensation and related costs and bad debt expense due to the bankruptcy of united airlines and certain minor customers during we have now completed the consolidation of certain home office  manufacturing  warehousing  product development  marketing and quality control functions into a single  square foot operating facility located in vernon  california 
we now maintain only two plants  the new site  and an existing  square foot cooking facility also located in vernon  california 
we also lease  on a month to month basis   square feet of dry goods storage space in inglewood  california 
our management believes that we should expect  as a result of this consolidation  to achieve significant operating efficiencies as well as a reduction of its dependence on outside cold storage facilities 
we have recently begun to realize the savings from the consolidation  resulting from reduced cold storage and refrigerant costs  a lower overall facility lease expense  together with manpower and efficiency savings 
other expenses 
other expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  in fiscal year  an increase of  
this increase consists primarily of a  increase in interest expense to  due to an increase in borrowings and borrowing rates during the year primarily related to the april refinancing  and a  increase in amortization of deferred financing costs to  related to the financing costs incurred in the prior year and the bridge financing and the refinancing of the bank debt during the current year 
of the  increase in interest expense   was non cash interest related to the amortization of the original issue discount from the april financing 
the original issue discount represents the difference of approximately  between the fair market value of  shares sold to llcp and the per share purchase price 
another significant component of other expenses was the  cost of refurbishing our vacated san diego facility upon the expiration of the lease 
income tax provision benefit 
for the fiscal year ended september  we recorded a tax benefit of  as compared to a tax provision of  for the fiscal year ended september   representing and of income loss before income taxes  respectively 
due to operating losses for the year ended september   we have recorded a tax benefit and a deferred tax asset  classified as other assets on our accompanying balance sheet  of  we have not recorded a valuation allowance against any of our deferred tax assets  since we believe that such assets are more likely than not to be recoverable through estimated future profitable operations 
if we fail to improve margins  grow revenues and or reduce future interest costs  and return to profitable operating results in the near term  we would not realize some or all of our deferred tax assets and we may be required to record a valuation allowance against some or all of our deferred tax assets  which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
net loss 
we reported a net loss for the fiscal year ended september  of  per share as compared to net income of  per share  diluted for the fiscal year ended september  we currently expect to improve on our current operating results  and return to profitable operations  primarily through a improved gross margins achieved by streamlining additional costs and continuing to leverage our new consolidated manufacturing and storage facilities to improve manufacturing efficiency  b growing revenues from profitable product lines and c reducing future interest costs on outstanding debt due to the recent refinancing of our long and short term debt 
as discussed in risk factors to our business and industry  included elsewhere herein  we may be unable to improve our operating results if we suffer a decline in our manufacturing efficiency  the loss of major customers  further declines in air travel  adverse changes in our operating costs or raw materials costs or other adverse changes to our business 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net revenues 
for the fiscal year ended september   our net revenues decreased  to  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september  this revenue decrease is substantially the result of a decrease in airline sales during the period 
in fiscal year  sales to airline customers were approximately million  or of net revenues  as compared to sales of million  or of net revenues in fiscal year as noted above  the events of september  significantly impacted our sales to airline related customers 
though the ongoing effect of these events on the airline industry  airline revenues  and on our business in particular  cannot be accurately determined at this time  we are estimating that in the near term  sales to airline customers will experience little to no growth from fiscal year levels 
gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended september  decreased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended september  gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  was compared to in the comparable prior period 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is primarily attributable to the significant decrease in sales to airline related customers  as well as lower overall margins due to higher employee insurance costs of approximately  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year and competitive pricing  offset somewhat by increased production and materials cost efficiencies achieved during the current year 
in fiscal year  we had recently begun to consolidate certain of our home office  manufacturing and warehousing  product development  and marketing and quality control facilities into a single location 
though we were  at that time  early in the process of implementing various stages of this plan  we believed that when the plan is fully implemented  we should expect to achieve significant operating efficiencies as well as a reduction of our dependence on outside cold storage facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended september  decreased  to  of net revenues from  of net revenues in the year earlier period 
sg a decreased overall primarily due to lower freight expenses related to the decrease in airline revenues and the ceasing of goodwill amortization during fiscal year  and additionally on a percentage basis primarily due to lower travel  advertising and compensation costs 
interest expense 
interest expense for was  as compared to  in  a decrease of  this decrease is primarily the result of lower average interest rates on outstanding borrowings 
income tax provision 
for the fiscal years ended september  and september   our income tax provision was  and  respectively  or and of income before income taxes  respectively 
the decrease in our income tax provision was a result of the decrease in income before income taxes 
net income 
our net income for the fiscal year ended september  amounted to  per share  diluted as compared to  per share  diluted for the fiscal year ended september  liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations  cash balances and additional financing capacity 
our cash and cash equivalents increased  to  as of september  compared to  at september  during the fiscal year ended september   our operating activities provided cash of approximately  as compared to cash provided of  during fiscal year the cash provided in the current year is primarily due to cash favorable changes in accounts receivable  inventories and accrued liabilities  reduced by uses of cash for a substantial reduction in accounts payable and an increase in prepaid expenses 
during the fiscal year ended september   our investing activities resulted in a use of cash of approximately  as compared to  during fiscal year the use of cash in the current year consisted almost exclusively of additions to property and equipment  primarily related to the consolidation of our operations into a new facility in vernon  california 
during the fiscal year ended september   our financing activities resulted in cash provided of approximately  as compared to cash provided of  during fiscal the cash provided in the current period resulted primarily from new short term borrowings subsequently refinanced to long term as discussed below  offset by the repayment of all amounts outstanding on our line of credit  principal payments on long term debt  additional deferred financing costs and cash payments to and on behalf of our former parent 
in november  we refinanced substantially all of our existing debt 
the total refinanced debt amounted to million at that time  consisting of a million line of credit provided by union bank of california  na the bank together with million in the form of a five year term secured senior subordinated term loan by levine leichtman capital partners ii  lp llcp or the senior subordinated lender 
both of these agreements were subsequently amended on multiple occasions as described further below and in our previous filings with the securities and exchange commission 
additionally  we issued a term note in the amount of million payable to union bank in connection with an acquisition that occurred in august at march   amounts outstanding under these arrangements were million on the revolving line of credit and  on term loans payable to union bank  and million payable to llcp on a term note 
our revolving line of credit  senior subordinated term note payable and term loan agreements all contain or contained various covenants  including financial covenants covering restrictions on capital expenditures  minimum levels of ebitda and net worth and specified debt service and debt to equity ratios 
in addition  the terms of the agreements prohibit changes in control  including ownership and certain management personnel and contain customary limitations on indebtedness and liens  making investments  paying dividends and making loans or advances 
as of march   we were experiencing liquidity shortfalls and were not in compliance with certain financial covenants with respect to our financing arrangements with both union bank and llcp 
to assist us in meeting our liquidity needs  effective as of april   we entered into amendments to our then existing securities purchase agreement with llcp  the secured senior subordinated note initially due october  to llcp and certain related agreements  pursuant to which llcp waived our non compliance with certain covenants under the securities purchase agreement and certain other documents  and llcp purchased from us a secured senior subordinated bridge note in the principal amount of million  bearing interest at  which was initially due and payable january   thereby providing us with the liquidity we needed to meet out short term payment obligations 
in a related transaction  llcp  through an llcp affiliate  acquired union bank s senior secured loans to us 
finally  as part of the bridge financing and in substantial consideration for llcp s financial accommodations  we agreed to issue and sell to llcp  and llcp agreed to purchase from us   shares of our common stock for a purchase price of per share 
we were originally required to issue and sell these shares to llcp by april   but we were unable to meet that deadline 
in addition  we were required to wind up and dissolve our subsidiary overhill lc ventures  inc by june   but we were also unable to meet that deadline 
llcp extended the issuance date to april   and then  in consideration of the payment by us to llcp of an amendment fee of  to july  as discussed below  this deadline was further extended to august  after completing the bridge financing and submitting an application to amex requesting listing of the shares to be issued to llcp  amex advised us that its approval of our listing application with respect to the issuance and sale of these shares to llcp would be subject to approval of our stockholders 
we obtained a waiver from llcp for our failure to deliver these shares by july   provided that delivery of these shares be made on or before august  at a meeting of our stockholders held on august   the stockholders approved the issuance of these shares to llcp  and we obtained amex approval and delivered the shares prior to the expiration of the waiver 
in connection with this transaction  a debt discount of approximately million was recorded and was being amortized over the remaining life of the debt 
effective april   pleasant street  an affiliate of llcp  acquired the senior secured loans previously made to us by union bank  and we and pleasant street amended and restated the senior secured loan arrangements on mutually acceptable terms and conditions 
as a result of the repayment of union bank  we wrote off unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately  related to the arrangements with union bank 
under the new amended and restated loan and security agreement with pleasant street  million owing to union bank on the effective date plus additional amounts newly advanced to us by pleasant street  million  together with the million owing to llcp under the bridge note described above  were combined into a new million term a loan  bearing interest at no less than  subject to periodic adjustments  and due and payable on november  an additional million advanced by pleasant street to us as of the effective date is evidenced by a term b loan  initially bearing interest at and initially due and payable january  we used million of proceeds from term loan a to repay the outstanding principal amounts of the term note issued to llcp on april  the senior term loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty 
the amended and restated loan and security agreement with pleasant street contains various covenants  including financial covenants covering restrictions on capital expenditures  minimum levels of ebitda and net worth  and specified debt service and debt to equity ratios 
in addition  the terms of the loan and security prohibit changes in control  including ownership and certain management personnel  and contain customary limitations on indebtedness and liens  making investments  paying dividends and making loans or advances 
the senior notes and all other obligations owing by us to pleasant street are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
at september   we were not in compliance with certain of the financial and other covenants of our agreements with llcp and pleasant street  including  among other things  our failure to observe the limitations on indebtedness relating to trade accounts payable  failure to comply with certain payment plans and our failure to liquidate overhill ventures before august  subsequent to september   we reached agreement with each of llcp and pleasant street wherein the lenders waived specified events of default by us under the then existing agreements and further agreed to a refinancing of all indebtedness owing by us to llcp and pleasant street as described below 
on october   we entered into refinancing arrangements with llcp and pleasant street in order to obtain an aggregate of  of additional funds to finance our accounts receivable  to build up our inventory levels and for other working capital purposes  to reduce the base rates of interest on and extend the maturity dates of the note held by llcp and the loans made by pleasant street  to amend the financial covenants and certain other provisions contained in the relevant investment documents with respect to llcp and the relevant loan documents with respect to pleasant street and to obtain waivers of specified events of default under then existing agreements with llcp and pleasant street 
as part of the october  refinancing  we and llcp amended our existing securities purchase agreement to  among other things  amend the financial covenants and certain event of default and other provisions 
in addition  llcp waived certain specified events of default 
we issued to llcp a second amended and restated secured senior subordinated note due october  in the stated principal amount of million in exchange for the surrender by llcp of the existing million senior subordinated note and million in additional cash funds 
the replacement note has a base rate of interest that was reduced from to  subject to increase upon the occurrence of an interest rate event  as defined  or event of default  and an extended maturity date from october  to october  we agreed to pay llcp amendment and new capital fees in the aggregate amount of  also as part of the october  refinancing  pleasant street and we amended our existing loan and security agreement to amend the financial covenants and various other provisions 
pleasant street waived certain specified events of default 
in addition  pleasant street made an additional term loan to us in the principal amount of  and surrendered the note evidencing the existing term a loan in exchange for a second amended and restated senior term a note in the principal amount of million 
the annual interest rate on the in formula portion of the term a loan was reduced from to 
the annual interest rate on the million term b loan was reduced from to 
the interest rates on the term a loan and term b loan are subject to increase upon the occurrence of any interest rate event  as defined  or event of default as provided in the notes that evidence those loans 
the maturity dates of the term a loan and the term b loan were extended to october  from november  and january   respectively 
the term b loan was modified to be a monthly amortizing term loan 
the prepayment terms of the term a loan and the term b loan were modified to provide  among other things  that we will make mandatory prepayments of annual excess cash flow  if any 
we agreed to pay pleasant street amendment and new capital fees in the aggregate amount of in conjunction with the october  refinancing  we  james rudis and llcp amended an investor rights agreement among us pursuant to which we granted to llcp the right to designate for nomination and election up to three members of our board of directors  together with the right to fill the next available vacancy created on the board of directors after october   which could result in llcp having up to four llcp representatives on the board at any time 
in addition  among other things  the parties extended to october  the time period during which annual consulting fees of  will be payable to llcp

as of october   we were in compliance with all of our amended financial covenants 
as of october   the last day of fiscal october  we were not in compliance with one of our financial covenants  but llcp and pleasant street waived the event of non compliance as of october  we currently believe  based upon forecasted performance  that it is probable that we will be in compliance with all of our revised financial and other covenant requirements 
accordingly  and as a result of the refinancing of the obligations described above  all principal amounts payable to llcp and to pleasant street  other than currently scheduled principal payments  have been classified as long term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet as of september  in the future  our failure to achieve certain revenue  expense and profitability levels could result in a violation of the amended financial covenants under our financing arrangements  which would cause the interest rates on the above loans to increase substantially and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
following is a summarization of our contractual obligations at september   after giving effect to the debt refinancing described above

see business manufacturing and sourcing in part i  item of this report 
from time to time  we made advances to treecon resources for various purposes in the context of our parent subsidiary relationship 
additionally  we have netted accumulated federal income tax liabilities payable to treecon resources against amounts owed from treecon resources to us 
we had approximately million in net receivables from treecon resources as of september  during the fiscal years ended september   september  and september   we made cash payments to  or on behalf of  treecon resources of approximately  million and  respectively for various purposes including tax payments  expense reimbursement and other corporate purposes 
in connection with the spin off  after giving effect to the netting of federal income tax liabilities payable to treecon resources against our receivable from treecon resources  the remaining net intercompany balance of approximately million payable to us by treecon resources was cancelled as described below 
also in connection with the spin off  treecon resources transferred to us two promissory notes made in the amounts of  and  made by mr 
rudis and mr 
shatley  respectively 
these notes became due and payable on september  and are collateralized solely by the common stock of treecon resources 
based on our assessment of the collectibility of these notes  including the value of the subject collateral  we assigned no value to the notes upon their receipt  and the notes continued to have no recorded value at september  future amounts ultimately realized  if any  on these notes will be recorded as an adjustment to shareholders equity at the time such amounts are realized 
in connection with the spin off  treecon resources agreed to indemnify us with respect to any current or future tax liabilities for which we might otherwise be liable resulting from the operations of any entity other than us 
we agreed with treecon resources to cancel any remaining amounts owed to us by treecon resources  or owed to treecon resources by us  as of the effective date of the spin off  after obtaining the appropriate consents under our financing arrangements 
as previously mentioned herein  the events of september  have significantly impacted our sales to airline related customers 
the effect of these events have been widely publicized  and have included  among other things  a decreased demand for air travel to due a variety of factors and increased costs and reduced operations by airlines  including meal services 
most of our larger airline customers have announced meal service reductions as part of cost efficiency programs 
though the ongoing effect of these events on the airline industry  airline revenues  and on our business in particular  cannot be accurately determined at this time  we are estimating that in the near term  sales to airline customers will experience little to no growth from levels 
in  sales to airline customers were approximately million  or of total net sales as compared to sales of million  or of total net sales in future adverse events in the airline industry  including additional terrorist attacks or other safety issues  additional regulation  significant bankruptcies  or significant continued cost reduction initiatives that further reduce the meal requirements of our larger airline customers  could negatively impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see risk factors related to our business and industry decline in air travel may negatively impact our revenues and costs below and business sales and marketing in part i  item of this report 
we believe that the funds available to us from operations and existing capital resources will be adequate for our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months

the company does not expect the adoption of interpretation no

interpretation no 
clarifies the requirement for recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of the guarantee  based on the fair value of a non contingent obligation to perform

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
these rules supersede eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
sfas requires that costs related to an exit or disposal activity can only be accrued when a liability is actually incurred  rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan

 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment 
we adopted sfas as of october  and no impairment of goodwill was recorded upon adoption 
had we been accounting for goodwill under sfas for all periods presented  our income before income taxes would have increased by  for fiscal year  and our net income would have increased by  per share and per diluted share for fiscal year critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
see note to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are related to its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk 
our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally require no collateral from our customers 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based primarily upon historical bad debt experience and current market conditions 
until fiscal  bad debt expense and accounts receivable write offs  net of recoveries  have historically been immaterial as we generally transact the substantial portion of our business with large  established food or service related businesses 
however  a bankruptcy or other significant financial deterioration of any significant customers could impact their future ability to satisfy their receivables with us 
our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally require no collateral from our customers 
for the fiscal years ended september   september  and september   revenues from airline related customers accounted for approximately   and of total net revenues  respectively 
additionally  accounts receivable from airline related customers accounted for approximately and of the total accounts receivable balance at september  and september   respectively 
for the fiscal years ended september   september  and september   our largest airline customer  american airlines  accounted for approximately  and of total net revenues  respectively 
additionally  accounts receivable from american airlines accounted for approximately and of the total accounts receivable at september  and september   respectively 
the events of september  have significantly impacted our sales to airlines 
the ongoing effect of these events on the airline industry  airline revenues  and on our business in particular  still cannot be accurately determined 
these events have resulted in a decreased demand for air travel and a reduction in the number of meals served as a result of airlines cost savings measures 
these effects  depending upon their scope and duration  could negatively impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  united airlines filed a petition for bankruptcy reorganization 
as of the date of united airlines bankruptcy filing  our outstanding receivable balance from united airlines was approximately  we will continue to pursue collection of these pre bankruptcy receivables through the normal course of the bankruptcy proceedings 
however  as of september   we have written off all of our pre bankruptcy receivables from united airlines due to uncertainty with respect to their ultimate collectibility 
we no longer do business with united airlines 
we continue to do business with american airlines 
we will evaluate our business relationship with american airlines on an ongoing basis to determine the manner in which our relationship should be continued 
inventories 
inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we use a standard costing system to estimate our fifo cost of inventory at the end of each reporting period 
historically  standard costs have been materially consistent with actual costs 
we determine the market value of our raw ingredients  finished product and packaging inventories based upon references to current market prices for such items as of the end of each reporting period and record a write down of inventory standard cost to market  when applicable 
we periodically review our inventory for excess items  and we establish a valuation reserve based upon the age of specific items in inventory and the expected recovery from the disposition of the items 
a reserve is established for the estimated aged surplus  spoiled or damaged products  and discontinued inventory items and components 
the amount of the reserve is determined by analyzing inventory composition  expected usage  historical and projected sales information  and other factors 
changes in sales volume due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could result in materially different amounts for this item 
excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired 
the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in accordance with sfas we have one reporting unit and estimate fair value based on a variety of market factors  including discounted cash flow analysis  market capitalization  and other market based data 
no impairment of goodwill was recorded during fiscal year at september   we had goodwill of million 
a continued deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect could decrease the estimated fair value of our business and  thus  cause our goodwill to become impaired and cause us to record a charge against operations in an amount representing the impairment 
income taxes 
for the one month period from september  to october   the effective date of the spin off  and for the years ended september  and september   we were included in the consolidated federal tax return of our former parent and have provided for federal taxes on a separate company basis in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
historically  with respect to state income taxes  primarily in california  we have been able to reduce our tax liability by offsetting otherwise taxable income with other losses under the parent entity 
on a separate company basis  we would have an approximate effective state tax rate of 
for periods following the completion of the spin off  our tax returns will be filed on a stand alone basis 
due to operating losses for the year ended september   we have recorded tax benefits and a deferred tax asset  classified as other assets on our accompanying balance sheet  of  we have not recorded a valuation allowance against any of our deferred tax assets  since we believe that such assets are more likely than not to be recoverable through estimated future profitable operations 
if we fail to improve margins  grow revenues and or reduce future interest costs  and return to profitable operating results in the near term  we would not realize some or all of our deferred tax assets and we may be required to record a valuation allowance against some or all of such assets  which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations

risk factors related to our business and industry our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive food industry may affect our operational performance and financial results 
the food industry is highly competitive  and our continued success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry 
we face competition in all of our markets from large  national companies and smaller  regional operators 
some of our competitors  including other diversified food companies  are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do 
from time to time we experience price pressure in certain of our markets as a result of competitors promotional pricing practices as well as market conditions generally 
our ability to reduce costs is limited to the extent efficiencies have already been achieved 
our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from any acquisitions would weaken our competitive position 
competition is based on product quality  distribution effectiveness  brand loyalty  price  effective promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences 
we may not be able to effectively compete with these larger  more diversified companies 
the loss or consolidation of any of our key customers could have a significant negative impact on our financial results 
the largest purchasers of our products  panda restaurant group and jenny craig products accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total net sales during the fiscal year ended september  we expect that our sales to these customers will continue to constitute a significant percentage of our net revenues 
the loss of either of these customers as an outlet for our products could significantly harm our competitive position and operating results 
sales to pinnacle foods declined in mid year of fiscal year  resulting in a million reduction in sales to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year also  subsequent to september  the grocery strike in southern california has reduced our sales to the grocery chains involved in the labor dispute 
sales of recurring items to albertson s in the first eleven weeks of fiscal year  september  to december   have fallen by million to million from million during the first eleven weeks of fiscal year  september  to december  these reductions in sales have been partially offset by increases in sales to new and existing retail customers 
in addition  the acquisition of one of our customers by a third party could have an adverse impact on our financial results if the resulting company chose to terminate their relationship with us and purchase products from our competitors 
additionally  if our customers consolidate and grow larger  our customers may demand lower pricing and more favorable terms 
further  these customers may reduce inventories and increase their use of other suppliers 
if we fail to use our sales  marketing and manufacturing expertise to respond to these trends  our sales volume could be impacted or we may need to lower our prices or increase promotional support of our products  any of which would adversely affect our profitability 
further declines in air travel may negatively impact our revenues  costs and collections 
a significant portion of our business is derived from the airline industry 
in  sales to airline customers were approximately million  or of total net sales  as compared to sales of million in and million in  representing and of total net sales in and  respectively 
additionally  accounts receivable from airline related customers accounted for approximately and of the total accounts receivable balance at september  and september   respectively 
the events of september  have significantly adversely impacted our sales to airline related customers 
though the long term effect of these events on the airline industry  airline revenues  and on our business in particular  cannot be accurately determined at this time  we estimate that in the near term  sales to airline customers will experience little to no growth from levels 
the total impacts that these events may have on the airline industry in general  and on our business in particular  are not known at this time 
the effects of these events have included  among other things  a decreased demand for air travel due to a variety of factors and increased costs and reduced operations by airlines  including meal services 
most of our larger airline customers have announced meal service reductions as part of cost efficiency programs 
a significant portion of our business focuses on the airline industry  and these effects  depending on their scope and duration  which we cannot predict at this time  could further negatively impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows by  among other things  decreasing our sales to and making it more difficult to collect receivables from airline customers 
we are subject to cost fluctuations in our operations that may adversely affect our profitability 
our business operations may experience operating cost volatility caused by external conditions  market fluctuations and changes in governmental policies 
for example  increases in our manufacturing costs and a decrease in our gross profits and operating income in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year were attributable in part to increased worker s compensation insurance premiums 
any substantial fluctuation in our manufacturing or operating costs  if not offset by product price increases  hedging activities or improved efficiencies  may have an adverse impact on our operating performance  business and financial condition 
we are major purchasers of many commodities that we use for raw materials and packaging  and price changes for the commodities we depend on may adversely affect our profitability 
the raw materials used in our business are largely commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions  commodity market fluctuations  currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs 
commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material and packaging costs  and we may be unable to increase our prices to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume  revenue and income 
any substantial fluctuation in the prices of raw materials  if not offset by increases in our sales prices  could have an adverse impact on our profitability 
we attempt to recover our commodity cost increases by increasing prices  promoting a higher margin product mix and obtaining additional operating efficiencies 
we may not be able to continue to offset raw material price increases to the same extent in the future 
we enter into contracts for the purchase of raw materials at fixed prices  which are designed to protect us against raw material price increases during their term 
we also use paper products  such as corrugated cardboard  aluminum products  and films and plastics to package our products 
substantial fluctuations in prices of packaging materials or continued higher prices of our raw materials could adversely affect our operating performance and financial results 
concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause customers to avoid our products 
we could be adversely affected if our customers and their customers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products 
adverse publicity about these types of concerns  like the publicity about genetically modified organisms  mad cow disease and foot and mouth disease in europe  whether or not valid  may discourage our customers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 
any negative change in customer perceptions about the safety and quality of our products could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
if our food products become adulterated or misbranded  we would need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured as a result 
food products occasionally contain contaminants due to inherent defects in those products or improper storage or handling 
we have never been required to recall any of our products 
under adverse circumstances  food manufacturers may need to recall some of their products if they become adulterated or misbranded and may also be liable if the consumption of any of their products causes injury 
a widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment against us could cause products to be unavailable for a period of time and a loss of customer confidence in our food products and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we are required to defend against a product liability claim  whether or not we are found liable under such a claim  we could incur substantial costs  our reputation could suffer and our customers might substantially reduce their existing or future orders from us 
while we maintain insurance that we believe is adequate to cover this type of loss  liability of this sort could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to this liability  which may require us  among other things  to expend substantial resources or to modify our product offerings or to make changes to one or more of our business processes 
any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute our stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results 
although we have no currently identified acquisition plans  we intend to acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products from time to time as part of our long term business strategy 
expansion of our operations in this manner would require significant additional expenses and resources 
expansion also could strain our management  financial and operational resources 
if we acquire a company  we could have difficulty in assimilating that company s personnel  operations  technology and software 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
we could also have to incur indebtedness to pay for any future acquisitions 
we also may issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
our business is subject to federal  state and local government regulations that could negatively impact our business and financial position 
food manufacturing operations are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local government entities and agencies 
as a producer of food products for human consumption  our operations are subject to stringent production  packaging  quality  labeling and distribution standards  including regulations mandated by the federal food and drug act 
we cannot predict whether future regulation by various federal  state and local governmental entities and agencies would harm our business and financial results 
in addition  our business operations and the past and present ownership and operation of our properties are subject to extensive and changing federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment  the handling and disposition of wastes including solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to protection of the environment 
we cannot assure you that additional environmental issues relating to presently known matters or identified sites or to other matters or sites will not require additional  currently unanticipated investigation  assessment or expenditures 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights  which could harm our competitive position  resulting in decreased revenue 
we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and competitive position 
accordingly  we devote what we believe are adequate resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and proprietary rights 
we have taken actions to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights 
however  these actions may be inadequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from claiming violations of their trademarks and proprietary rights by us 
from time to time we license content from third parties 
while we generally require adequate indemnifications  it is possible that in the future we could face infringement actions based upon the content licensed from these third parties 
if any of these claims are proved valid  through litigation or otherwise  we may be required to do any of the following  which could adversely affect our business o cease using the third party trademarks  o acquire other licenses  o develop our own proprietary marks  or o pay financial damages 
some of our significant customer and supplier contracts are short term 
some of our customers and suppliers operate through purchase orders or short term contracts 
though we have long term business relationships with many of our customers and suppliers  we cannot assure you that any of these customers or suppliers will continue to do business with us on the same basis 
additionally  though we try to renew these contracts as they come due  there can be no assurance that these customers or suppliers will renew the contracts on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
the termination of any number of these contracts may adversely affect our business and prospects  including our financial performance and results of operations 
our common stock price is subject to significant volatility  which could result in substantial losses for investors and in litigation against us 
our common stock began trading on amex under the symbol ofi on november  during the week period ended december   the high and low closing sales prices of our common stock were per share and per share  respectively 
prices for our shares are determined in the marketplace and may accordingly be influenced by many factors  including  but not limited to o the depth and liquidity of the market for the shares  o quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  o announcements about our performance as well as the announcements of our competitors about the performance of their business  o investors evaluations of our future prospects and the food industry generally  o changes in earnings estimates by  or failure to meet the expectations of  securities analysts  o our dividend policy  and o general economic and market conditions 
in addition  the stock market often experiences significant price fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is traded 
these market fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our shares 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management s attention and resources 
consequently  the price at which investors purchase shares of our common stock may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market 
investors may be unable to sell their shares of common stock at or above their purchase price  which may result in substantial losses 
the loss of certain of our executive officers would constitute a change in control and  therefore  an event of default under our securities purchase and loan agreements and would likely have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management  particularly james rudis  our president and chief executive officer  john l 
steinbrun  our senior vice president and chief financial officer 
though we have employment agreements with mr 
rudis and mr 
steinbrun  each of these agreements provides for voluntary resignation prior to the end of the term of the agreement 
the loss of the services of mr 
rudis or mr 
steinbrun would likely have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  our securities purchase and loan agreements with llcp  our senior subordinated creditor  and pleasant street  our senior secured creditor  provide that a change in control would occur if mr 
rudis or mr 
steinbrun ceases to have certain management responsibilities in our business  or if mr 
rudis does not continue to hold a minimum number of shares of our common stock 
the occurrence of a change in control would permit llcp to accelerate all indebtedness owing under the senior subordinated note we issued to it and constitute an event of default under the securities purchase agreement 
llcp would then have the right to require us to immediately repay all of our obligations then owing to it 
we may not have sufficient funds to repay this indebtedness upon an event of default 
accordingly  the occurrence of a change in control could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our failure to attract and retain key management personnel could harm our business 
our business requires managerial  financial and operational expertise and our future success depends upon the continued service of key personnel 
as a value added manufacturer of quality frozen food products and customer prepared foods  we operate in a specialized industry 
our key personnel have experience and skills specific to this industry  and there are a limited number of individuals with the relevant experience and skills 
though we have employment agreements with mr 
rudis and mr 
steinbrun  each of these agreements provides for voluntary resignation on the part of the executive prior to the end of the term of the agreement 
if we lose any of our key personnel  our business operations could suffer 
a small group of stockholders controls a significant amount of our common stock 
after giving effect to the shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants and conversion of shares of our series a convertible preferred stock described below  our executive officers and directors and stockholders who own greater than of our common stock would own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  if acting together  could be able to significantly influence matters requiring approval by the stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
in addition  our amended investor rights agreement with llcp provides that llcp has the right to designate for nomination and election up to three members of our board of directors  together with the right to fill the next available vacancy created on the board of directors after october   which could result in llcp having up to four representatives on the board at any time 
our articles of incorporation  our bylaws and provisions of nevada law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so could be in our stockholders interest 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so might be in the best interest of our stockholders 
it could be difficult for a potential bidder to acquire us because our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions  which may discourage takeover attempts 
these provisions may limit stockholders ability to approve a transaction that stockholders may think is in their best interests 
these provisions include a requirement that certain procedures must be followed before matters can be proposed for consideration at meetings of our stockholders and the ability of our board of directors to fix the rights and preferences of an issue of shares of preferred stock without stockholder action 
provisions of nevada s business combinations statute also restrict certain business combinations with interested stockholders 
we have elected not to be governed by these provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation 
however  this election is not effective until months after the approval of our amended and restated articles of incorporation in september and may not be effective at that time unless we meet certain conditions under the nevada statute 
the provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and nevada law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow the board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value 
however  such provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk obligations 
we are currently subject to interest rate risk on variable interest rate obligations 
a hypothetical increase in average market interest rates would increase annual interest expense on currently outstanding debt by approximately  we are also subject to interest rate risk on our fixed interest rate obligations 
based upon outstanding amounts of fixed rate obligations as of september   a hypothetical decrease in average market interest rates would increase the fair value of outstanding fixed rate debt by approximately  we do not own  nor do we have an interest in  any other market risk sensitive instruments
