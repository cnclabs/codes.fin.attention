business strategy in response to what was perceived to be a highly fragmented industrial distribution real estate industry  prologis was formed in with the primary objective of creating an operating company in the united states that would differentiate itself from its competition through its ability to meet a corporate customer s distribution property requirements on a national  regional and local basis with the added benefit of providing consistent levels of service throughout the country 
prologis was able to take advantage of unique market conditions in its early years that allowed it to build an asset base of industrial distribution properties in the united states  in many cases at prices below replacement cost 
prologis also began acquiring a land inventory in key distribution markets that could be developed into industrial distribution properties 
prologis funded its initial portfolio and the formation of its national operating system primarily with direct public debt and public equity capital 
prologis common shares of beneficial interest  par value per share common shares were listed on the new york stock exchange nyse in march all of prologis acquired and developed distribution properties were integrated into one operating segment the property operations segment as prologis intent was to hold these investments on a long term basis while generating rental income 

table of contents an integral part of prologis customer service focus is having a portfolio that meets the distribution space needs of its existing customers and also the needs of targeted national and international companies 
as these companies expanded and managed their businesses for greater profitability  they also expanded and reconfigured their distribution networks  including expansion of their networks outside of the united states 
in order to meet the growing distribution space needs of these companies  prologis expanded its operations to mexico and europe in and to japan in in  prologis business expanded to include the corporate distribution facilities services operating segment cdfs business to utilize prologis existing development capabilities to develop properties for sale to third parties  in addition to prologis existing development activities that focused only on the development of properties for long term investment 
the cdfs business was concentrated in north america until when these activities were added as a complement to prologis property operations segment activities in europe 
with the acquisition of an established development business in the united kingdom in august  prologis had access to strategic land positions in a country in which prologis previously had limited investments and where significant barriers for initial start up activities existed 
with holdings in both the united kingdom and continental europe  prologis was positioned to be a single source pan european provider of distribution space to global users 
after  prologis focused on creating a critical mass of operating properties in key distribution markets in the united states  in addition to growing its cdfs business activities 
to this end  prologis merged with a publicly traded reit in march  adding million square feet of distribution properties in the united states to prologis property operations segment 
and  to enhance its presence in europe  prologis acquired million square feet of distribution properties  primarily in paris  through its acquisition of a real estate operating company in december prologis  as a reit  must distribute rather than reinvest substantial amounts of its internally generated capital 
consequently  prologis utilized the public debt and equity capital markets to build its portfolio and operating system 
by early  the public equity capital markets were an increasingly costly method of raising capital 
to secure private equity capital  prologis changed the primary focus of its overall development activities from the development of distribution properties to hold in the property operations segment on a long term basis to the development of distribution properties in the cdfs business segment that  upon completion  are generally contributed to property funds formed by prologis 
accordingly  the primary focus of the cdfs business segment became that of developing properties to be contributed to property funds rather than properties that are sold to third parties 
as a reit  prologis can dispose of its properties under certain circumstances  therefore  prologis taxable reit subsidiaries develop properties that prologis intends to sell to third parties 
properties that prologis intends to contribute to the property funds are developed directly by the reit or one of its qualified reit subsidiaries 
property funds are business partnerships between prologis and private investors  primarily institutional capital sources  with the private investors having equal or majority ownership interests in each property fund 
the property funds acquire distribution properties  primarily from prologis with the intent to hold these properties as long term investments 
prologis acts as manager of the property fund and the individual properties that each fund owns 
prologis intends to hold each of its ownership interests in the property funds as long term investments 
the property fund strategy i allows prologis to realize  for financial reporting purposes  a portion of the development profits attendant to its cdfs business activities by contributing its developed properties to a property fund  ii provides a source of private capital to prologis  and iii allows prologis  as the manager of the property fund  to maintain its market presence and customer relationships that are the key drivers of its operating system 
prologis realizes a portion of the development profits from the properties contributed to property funds to the extent of the third party investment in the property fund acquiring the property 
the proceeds received by prologis from the contribution of properties to the property funds are recycled into prologis cdfs business segment thus  providing a private funding source for its future development activities and continued growth 
to supplement the private equity investments in each property fund  the property funds obtain secured debt financing using their properties as security such that the leverage ratios in the property funds range from to 
approximately billion of debt and private equity capital has been raised since the formation of prologis first property fund in august prologis has since created 
table of contents seven additional property funds that primarily acquire properties that have been developed by prologis 
of the eight property funds  six own properties in north america  including one property fund that owns properties in both the united states and mexico  one property fund owns properties in europe and one property fund owns a property in japan 
as a result of this shift in its business strategy  prologis total income in the cdfs business segment has grown from million in to million in fees generated from property management and other services provided to the property funds by prologis in its role as manager of each of the funds were million in these fees are included as part of the total income of the property operations segment  not the cdfs business segment 
in and  prologis acquired an international temperature controlled distribution and logistics network 
after four years of investing in this operating segment  prologis decided to reduce the level of its investment in favor of maintaining its focus on its core operating segments property operations and the cdfs business 
since june  prologis investees in this operating segment have disposed of over million cubic feet of operating facilities in the united states and europe 
prologis has investments in only one temperature controlled distribution company as of december  substantially all of this investee s operations are in france and the united kingdom 
the operating assets in the united kingdom were classified as held for sale by prologis investee in december financial results prologis net earnings attributable to common shares were million in and million in prologis temperature controlled distribution operations segment was the primary source of the increase in net earnings in over this operating segment s share of prologis earnings from operations was income of million in as compared to a loss of million in the loss was primarily attributable to the recognition of impairment charges and net losses related to the disposition of certain operating assets  of which prologis proportionate share  recognized under the equity method  was million million and million of impairment charges related to operating assets and technology investments  respectively  and net losses of million

in late  prologis observed a slowing in its european customers decision making processes with respect to changes in or reconfigurations of their distribution networks

prologis investment strategy in the property operations segment has focused primarily on generic industrial distribution properties in key distribution markets

certain operating properties developed by prologis in the cdfs business segment with the intent to contribute the property to a property fund or sell the property to a third party and properties that have been acquired by prologis with the intent to contribute the property to a property fund are included in the property operations segment for periods of time prior to their contribution or sale

prologis earned million in various fees from the property funds  primarily from property management and asset management services provided to the property funds 
market presence prologis has generally invested in distribution markets in north america  europe and japan in which prologis has identified strong distribution dynamics and supply and demand factors that have previously allowed for higher occupancy levels and increasing rental rates 
in making its investment decisions  prologis evaluates market conditions that indicate favorable distribution growth prospects including  but not limited to i growth in imports and exports  ii long term cost and quality of labor advantages for domestic and international manufacturers  iii proximity to large regional and local population centers with good access to transportation networks  iv expansion and contraction needs of distribution space users located in the market  and v an historically high ratio of distribution space per capita 
prologis assesses its market presence not only in terms of its investments in the market  but also by the extent it has developed relationships with customers in such markets 
prologis believes it can maintain these relationships by offering operating properties that are functional and cost effective  complemented by a comprehensive level of customer service 
prologis believes that by being a significant local owner and developer in a given market it has the ability to increase customer retention because it can meet its customers needs to either expand or contract through its network of distribution properties and land positions that allow prologis to relocate a customer within its existing inventory of distribution space or to readily develop a new property for the customer

competition in general  numerous other industrial distribution properties are located in close proximity to prologis properties 
the amount of rentable distribution space available in any market could have a material effect on prologis ability to rent space and on the rents that prologis can charge 
in addition  in many of prologis submarkets  institutional investors and owners and developers of industrial distribution properties including other reits compete for the acquisition  development and leasing of the same distribution space 
many of these entities have substantial resources and experience

prologis has no plans to increase its property operations segments in europe or japan  except through growth of its property funds 
prologis plans to continue with its current business strategy with respect to the growth in assets held by property funds

however  the development process can be impeded by weather in certain markets  particularly during the winter months  affecting the scheduling of development activities and potentially delaying construction completions 
future plans prologis intends to utilize the capital generated through the contributions or sales of properties  the proceeds from public debt offerings that take advantage of favorable market conditions and  to a lesser extent  the proceeds from sales of its common shares under various plans to finance its future cdfs business activities in north america  europe and japan 
to this end  prologis issued million of senior unsecured notes in february  representing its first public debt offering since april the proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings on prologis revolving lines of credit that had been incurred to fund prologis development and acquisition activities 
prologis success in this operating segment depends on its ability to develop and lease properties and the availability of private capital that can be used by a property fund to acquire properties that have been developed or acquired in the cdfs business segment 
see competition 
prologis believes that the reconfiguration of supply chains driven by the need for distribution space users to add efficiencies within their distribution networks will continue to favorably impact the demand for distribution properties and the distribution related services that prologis provides in the cdfs business segment 
also  a limited supply of state of the art distribution space in europe and japan could also provide opportunities within this operating segment 
however  for prologis to take advantage of these opportunities under its current business strategy  the availability of private capital is critical 
prologis is committed to offer to contribute to existing property funds substantially all of its stabilized developed properties in north america through december  in europe through september and in japan through june prologis believes that these property funds have available capital  including borrowing capacity  to acquire the properties that prologis expects it will be available for contribution in north america and europe through june and in japan through june prologis north american properties fund v and prologis european properties fund do not have capital commitments from third parties at this time such that they can acquire properties from prologis after june however  prologis expects that both of these property funds will secure additional capital commitments such they will be able to acquire prologis available properties after june prologis japan properties fund has a capital commitment from an institutional investor that is expected to be sufficient to acquire all of the properties that prologis expects to be available for contribution through june prologis north american properties fund v s majority owner is a listed property trust in australia that raises capital in the public market 
prologis european properties fund is seeking additional equity commitments and has had discussions with certain institutional investors  including some investors that are currently owners of the property fund 
there can be no assurance that these property funds will obtain a sufficient amount of capital either debt or equity capital such that they will be able to acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available for contribution after june and  there can be no assurance that if additional commitments are not received by the property funds  prologis will be able to secure other sources 
table of contents of private equity capital such that it can contribute or sale its stabilized development properties in a timely manner to allow prologis to continue to generate development profits through the end of the current commitment periods

this investment  along with prologis investment in a similar company operating in europe that was made in  were presented under the equity method 
in and  significant portions of these investees operating assets were sold and prologis no longer considers the temperature controlled distribution operations segment to be one of its primary operating segments or a primary line of business 
at december   the remaining operating assets in this operating segment were only in europe  primarily in france and the united kingdom

the sale of a significant portion of the united states temperature controlled distribution operating assets occurred in october after the sale  million of assets that were not sold four leased facilities and four land parcels were integrated into prologis two primary operating segments and are now presented on a consolidated basis as  concurrent with the sale  prologis acquired all voting ownership interests of its united states investee 
previously  prologis ownership interests were all non voting 
see note to prologis consolidated financial statements in item operations frigoscandia sa earns revenues from unaffiliated customers for various services associated with temperature controlled distribution operations 
prologis recognizes its proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of frigoscandia sa under the equity method as a component of its total income 
prior to the disposition of all of the united states operations by prologis investee in this operating segment  prologis also recognized its proportionate share of this investee s net earnings or losses under the equity method

table of contents market presence market presence in the temperature controlled distribution industry is generally defined by the volume available for storage of frozen and chilled foods in addition to the transportation network in place to serve customers 
frigoscandia sa operates a storage network in france and the united kingdom  has an investment in a temperature controlled operating company in austria and has transportation operations in the netherlands 
competition prologis believes that the temperature controlled distribution industry has significant barriers to entry due to its capital intensive nature  which limits competition 
frigoscandia is one of a few european temperature controlled distribution companies that have operations in more than one country 
frigoscandia s primary competition in each country is from local smaller warehouse operators 
customers in the united kingdom  frigoscandia sa has approximately customers 
of frigoscandia sa s total revenues in the united kingdom  approximately were derived from its largest customers and frigoscandia sa s largest customer in the united kingdom accounted for approximately of its total revenues 
in france  frigoscandia sa has approximately  customers 
of frigoscandia sa s total revenues in france  approximately were derived from its largest customers and frigoscandia sa s largest customer in france accounted for approximately of its total revenues 
employees frigoscandia sa employs approximately  persons in three european countries 
of these employees  approximately participate in collective bargaining agreements 
frigoscandia sa believes that its relationship with its employees is good 
seasonal nature of the business temperature controlled distribution operations are seasonal  in that demand for temperature controlled storage capacity is stronger during the third quarter of the calendar year and is at its lowest level in the first quarter of the calendar year 
the seasonal nature of temperature controlled distribution operations coincides with the lower demand for frozen foods  such as ice cream  during the winter months and the timing of the harvests of various food crops in the third quarter of the year 
future plans the focus in both france and the united kingdom in will be on increasing the operating efficiencies and profitability 
the operating assets located in the united kingdom were classified as held for sale in december indicating that frigoscandia sa intends to dispose of these assets and that it believes that such disposition will occur before the end of see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations temperature controlled distribution operations for a discussion of operating performance of this operating segment and the discussion of factors that could affect the future plans of prologis and frigoscandia sa at item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with prologis consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item of this report 
some statements contained in this discussion are not historical facts but are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of because these forward looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which prologis operates  management s beliefs and assumptions made by management  they involve uncertainties that could significantly impact prologis financial results 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include discussions of strategy  plans or intentions of management 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
the discussions concerning prologis expectations with respect to economic conditions in the united states  its ability to raise private capital and generate income in the cdfs business segment including the discussions with respect to prologis expectations as to the availability of capital in prologis european properties fund and prologis north american properties fund v such that these property funds will be able to acquire prologis stabilized developed properties that are expected to be available for contribution during and its plans for its investments in the temperature controlled distribution operations segment contain forward looking statements 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
factors that may affect outcomes and results include i changes in general economic conditions in prologis markets that could adversely affect demand for prologis properties and the creditworthiness of prologis customers  ii changes in financial markets  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could adversely affect prologis cost of capital  its ability to meet its financial needs and obligations and its results of operations  iii increased or unanticipated competition for distribution properties in prologis markets  iv the availability of private capital to prologis  v geopolitical concerns and uncertainties resulting because the united states is at war with iraq  and vi those additional factors discussed under risk factors 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management 
generally  the judgment requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
of the accounting policies discussed in note to prologis consolidated financial statements in item  those presented below have been identified by prologis as critical accounting policies 
consolidation prologis consolidated financial statements include the accounts of prologis  its wholly owned subsidiaries and its majority owned and controlled subsidiaries and partnerships 
all subsidiaries in which prologis owns a majority voting interest are consolidated 
investments in entities in which prologis does not own a majority voting interest but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method 
investments in entities in which prologis does not own a majority voting interest and over which prologis does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  as appropriate 
management s judgments with respect to its level of influence or control of each entity involves consideration of various factors including the form of prologis ownership interest  its representation on the board of directors  the size of its investment including loans and prologis ability to participate in policy making decisions 
management s ability to correctly assess its influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in prologis financial 
table of contents statements and  consequently  its financial position and specific items in its results of operations which are used by its shareholders  potential investors  industry analysts and lenders to evaluate prologis 
impairment of long lived assets prologis and its unconsolidated investees assess the carrying value of their respective long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable and  with respect to goodwill  at least annually using a fair value based test 
the determination of the fair value of long lived assets  including goodwill  involves significant judgment 
this judgment is based on management s analysis and estimates of the future operating results and resulting cash flows of each long lived asset 
management s ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows impacts the determination of fair value 
if there is a decline in fair value of a long lived asset combined with a history of operating losses for the asset  prologis or its unconsolidated investees will be required to determine whether the losses associated with the asset will continue 
management s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is primarily based on estimates of future operating results  the resulting cash flows and prologis intent to either hold or dispose of the long lived asset 
if an investment is considered impaired  a write down is recognized 
revenue recognition prologis recognizes gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets generally at the time the title to the asset is transferred and prologis has no future involvement with the asset sold 
in certain transactions  an entity in which prologis has an ownership interest will acquire the real estate assets from prologis 
management makes judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that prologis can recognize given its ownership interests and its level of future involvement in these investees that are acquiring the assets 
management s ability to accurately assess the provisions of each disposition transaction under the accounting guidelines for profit recognition could impact prologis financial position and results of operations which are used by shareholders  potential investors  industry analysts and lenders to evaluate prologis 
depreciation and useful lives of real estate assets prologis estimates the depreciable portion of its real estate assets and the related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense related to these assets 
management s ability to accurately estimate the depreciable portion of its real estate assets and their useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets 
any change to the estimated depreciable lives of these assets used by prologis would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized by prologis

in january  interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  was issued 
prologis is required to adopt the requirements of this interpretation for its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  this interpretation clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  and requires that prologis present any variable interest entities in which it has a majority variable interest on a consolidated basis in its financial statements 
based on its initial assessment  prologis believes that it will begin to consolidate frigoscandia sa and csi frigo llc in its financial statements beginning with the consolidated condensed financial statements issued for the quarterly period ended september  currently  prologis presents its investments in frigoscandia sa and csi frigo llc  which operate in the temperature controlled distributions segment  on the equity method 
prologis combined effective ownership in these entities was at december  see temperature controlled distribution operations 
in november  interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others as an interpretation of sfas nos 
 and and a rescission of interpretation no 
was issued 
this interpretation elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit and provides that an entity that issues a guarantee must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee 
further  this interpretation requires that this information be disclosed in the interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  prologis does not believe that the application of this interpretation will have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the disclosure requirements in the interpretation were effective immediately and prologis has made all applicable disclosures in the notes to its consolidated financial statements for results of operations prologis net earnings attributable to common shares were million in  million in and million in basic and diluted per share net earnings attributable to common shares were and per share  respectively  in and and per share  respectively  in basic and diluted net earnings attributable to common shares were per share in the temperature controlled distribution operating segment was the primary source of prologis increase in net earnings in from under the equity method  prologis proportionate share of the earnings or losses of its two unconsolidated investees operating in this segment was income of million in  a loss of million in and a loss of million in the loss in is primarily attributable to poor operating performance 
in  the operating performance of these companies did not improve and prologis proportionate share of these companies combined net losses from the sales of significant portions of their operating assets and related impairment charges was million 
in  the operating performance of these companies improved over levels  in part due to depreciation not being recognized on assets held for sale 
also in  prologis proportionate share of these companies combined net gains from the dispositions of significant portions of their assets and related impairment charges was million 
in  prologis shifted the primary focus of its development activities to the development of properties that prologis intends to contribute to property funds or sell to third parties 
consequently  the cdfs business segment s role in prologis business strategy increased 
the cdfs business segment provides capital to fund prologis development activities and generates profits that have contributed to prologis net earnings 
prologis earnings from operations from this segment were constant in million as compared to million in after increasing by million in over and increasing by million in over the increases in and were primarily the result of the volume of properties contributed to property funds by prologis

consequently  the size of this portfolio will fluctuate from period to period 
also  prologis will  as necessary  contribute operating properties originally intended for long term investment to a property fund in order to meet the leasing  geographic and size requirements of a property fund s third party investors 
the increase in properties directly owned in from is partially due to the poor economic conditions in the united states during leasing activity slowed in  delaying contributions to property funds since the properties that are contributed to property funds generally must meet certain leasing criteria

in certain leasing situations  prologis finds it advantageous to have its customers exercise termination clauses in their leases  however  prologis cannot predict the levels of such fees that will be earned in the future or whether prologis will be successful in re leasing the vacant space associated with the lease terminations in a timely manner 
rental income  excluding termination and renegotiation fees  decreased by million in from  primarily due to lower average occupancy levels in as compared to overall occupancy declines were experienced in all regions of the united states and in europe 
rental income  excluding termination and renegotiation fees decreased by million in from  primarily due to the decrease in the number of operating properties directly owned during the period and  to a lesser extent  deceases in average occupancy levels

table of contents the number and composition of operating properties in the directly owned portfolio throughout the periods presented impacts rental expenses for each period 
the increase in net rental expenses in is primarily due to the lower occupancy levels experienced in lower occupancy levels result in certain fixed costs being incurred directly by prologis  as there are fewer customers to pay them 
additionally  a higher percentage of common area costs were absorbed by prologis in  as there are fewer customers available from whom these costs can be recovered

prologis defines its stabilized properties as those properties where the capital improvements  repositioning efforts  new management and new marketing programs for acquisitions and development and marketing programs in the case of newly developed properties have been completed and in effect for a sufficient period of time  generally months  to achieve stabilized occupancy  typically 
prologis believes that the decrease in its stabilized occupancy levels in the united states in is primarily the result of the current economic conditions that have led to a slowing in customer leasing decisions and in a slowing in the absorption of new distribution properties in many of prologis united states markets 
prologis does not expect market conditions affected by the united states economy to change significantly in while there have been some positive trends in occupancy levels in certain markets in late  prologis believes that occupancies will remain unstable and that further declines in occupancies in the united states  if any  would not be significant 
prologis believes that the effects of these united states market occupancy decreases have been mitigated through the diversification benefits of its global operating platform and the prologis operating system 

table of contents based on its recent leasing experience  prologis believes that shifts in distribution patterns of its customers in europe and their needs to reduce their distribution costs are key drivers of leasing decisions in its european markets 
prologis believes that current geopolitical concerns and the uncertainties that result because the united states is at war with iraq have led to a slowing of customers decision making processes in europe with respect to changes in their distribution networks 
prologis cannot predict the effect that these uncertainties will have on its ability to re let distribution space that is subject to expiring leases in should prologis european properties fund experience significant occupancy declines  prologis would recognize less earnings from its investment in prologis european properties fund 
in japan  prologis has fully leased two of its four development projects  aggregating  square feet 
prologis is currently in negotiation for all of the space in the three remaining projects aggregating million square feet 
the average increase in rental rates for both new and renewed leases on previously leased space million square feet for all properties including those owned by the property funds during was as compared to in and in prologis believes that the weaker rental rate growth experienced in is attributable to the downturn in the united states economy that began in late prologis same store portfolio of operating properties  properties owned by prologis and the property funds that were in operation throughout both and  aggregated million square feet 
the net operating income rental income  excluding termination and renegotiation fees  less net rental expenses generated by the same store portfolio decreased by in from in  the same store portfolio s net operating income increased by over cdfs business earnings from operations from prologis cdfs business segment consists primarily of i the gains and losses from the contribution and sale of developed properties and from the contribution of properties that were acquired with the intent to contribute the properties to a property fund  including properties that have been rehabilitated and or repositioned  ii gains and losses from the disposition of land parcels  iii development management fees earned by prologis for services provided to third parties  and iii income recognized under the equity method from prologis investment in kingspark sa through june  under the equity method  prologis recognized over of the earnings of kingspark sa since january  and of the earnings of kingspark sa prior to that date which includes in addition to net operating income i interest income and interest expense net of capitalized amounts  ii general and administrative expenses net of capitalized amounts  iii income taxes  and iv foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
see notes and to prologis consolidated financial statements in item income from the cdfs business segment is dependent on prologis ability to develop and lease distribution properties that can be contributed to property funds or sold to third parties generating profits to prologis and prologis success in raising private capital through the formation of property funds or other sources 
there can be no assurance that prologis will be able to maintain the current level of profits in this operating segment 
prologis does believe that current geopolitical concerns and the uncertainties that result because the united states is at war with iraq have led to a slowing of customers decision making processes with respect to changes in their distribution networks 
prologis cannot predict the effect that these uncertainties will have on its ability to lease its completed development properties  the length of time that such uncertainties will continue or the effect  if any  that an end to the war would have on these decision making processes 
if prologis is unable to timely lease its completed developments  it will be unable to contribute these properties to the european properties fund or otherwise dispose of the properties and would be unable to recognize development profits in the anticipated accounting period

the deferred income tax component of total income taxes is a function of the period s temporary differences items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for book purposes and the utilization of tax net operating losses generated in prior years that had been recognized as deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax expense in is primarily the result of the reversal of previously recognized deferred tax benefits due to the utilization of net operating losses from previous years

prologis may in the future provide guarantees of short term financing arrangements that property funds enter into associated with the contributions of properties to the property funds by prologis 
these guarantees would be provided by prologis on short term financing arrangements that the property funds enter into on an interim basis prior to obtaining long term secured debt 
distribution and dividend requirements prologis distribution policy is to distribute a percentage of its cash flow that ensures that prologis will meet the distribution requirements of the code and allows prologis to maximize the cash retained to meet other cash needs such as capital improvements and investment activities 
because depreciation is a non cash expense  cash flow typically will be greater than earnings from operations and net earnings 
therefore  annual distributions are expected to be higher than annual earnings 
cash distributions per common share paid in  and were  and  respectively 
the board set a projected annual distribution rate for of per common share 
prologis paid a distribution for the first quarter of of per common share on february  to holders of common shares at february  the payment of distributions is subject to the discretion of the board and is dependent upon the financial condition and operating results of prologis and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year 
at december   prologis had three series of cumulative redeemable preferred shares of beneficial interest outstanding 
the annual dividend rates on these series of preferred shares are per share series c  per share series d and per share series e 
pursuant to the terms of its preferred shares  prologis is restricted from declaring or paying any distribution with respect to its common shares unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to its preferred shares have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the then current dividend period with respect to the preferred shares 
other commitments at december   prologis had letters of intent or contingent contracts  subject to prologis final due diligence  for the acquisition of properties aggregating million square feet at an estimated acquisition cost of million 
at december   prologis had million of funds escrowed with third parties as the result of tax deferred exchange transactions that can be used to acquire these assets 
in january  
table of contents prologis completed the acquisition of of these properties aggregating million square feet at a total acquisition cost of million 
the remaining transactions are subject to a number of conditions and prologis cannot predict with certainty that they will be consummated 
at december   prologis had properties under development with an expected cost at completion of million of which million was unfunded 
prologis has a common share repurchase program under which it may repurchase up to million of its common shares 
the common shares have been and  to the extent these repurchases continue  will be purchased in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions  depending on market prices and other conditions 
at december   prologis has repurchased  common shares under this program at a total cost of million 
an additional million of common shares may be repurchased under the program as of december  million at march  
derivative financial instruments prologis uses derivative financial instruments as hedges to manage well defined risk associated with interest and foreign currency rate fluctuations on existing or anticipated obligations and transactions 
prologis does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the primary risks associated with derivative instruments are market risk and credit risk 
market risk is defined as the potential for loss in the value of the derivative due to adverse changes in market prices interest rates or foreign currency rates 
the use of derivative financial instruments allows prologis to manage the risks of increases in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to the effects these fluctuations would have on prologis income and cash flows 
credit risk is the risk that one of the parties to a derivative contract fails to perform or meet their financial obligation under the contract 
prologis does not obtain collateral to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but monitors the credit standing of counterparties  primarily global commercial banks 
prologis does not anticipate non performance by any of the counterparties to its derivative contracts 
however  should a counterparty fail to perform  prologis would incur a financial loss to the extent of the positive fair market value of the derivative instruments  if any 
at december   prologis had foreign currency put option contracts outstanding in the notional amount of million euro and million pound sterling the currency equivalent of approximately million related to its operations in europe 
the put option contracts were fully paid for at execution and provide prologis with the option to exchange amounts of euro and pound sterling for us dollars at a fixed exchange rate such that  if the euro or pound sterling were to depreciate against the us dollar to predetermined levels as set by the contracts  prologis could exercise its options and mitigate its foreign currency exchange losses 
the outstanding contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and were marked to market through income at december  in  prologis recognized aggregate expense of million on various put option contracts  including realized losses of million and mark to market losses of million 
funds from operations funds from operations attributable to common shares increased million to million in from million in funds from operations attributable to common shares decreased by million in to million from million in the decrease in  is primarily attributable to the recognition by prologis of losses of million representing prologis proportionate share of impairment charges associated with technology related investments of certain of its unconsolidated investees 
prologis considers funds from operations to be a useful supplemental measure of comparative period operating performance and as a supplemental measure to provide management  financial analysts  potential investors and shareholders with an indication of prologis ability to fund its capital expenditures and investment activities and its other cash needs 
funds from operations does not represent net earnings or cash from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund 
table of contents cash needs  which is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows in prologis consolidated financial statements in item funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of prologis operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
additionally  the funds from operations measure presented by prologis will not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
funds from operations is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit generally as net earnings computed in accordance with gaap  excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization  gains and losses from sales of properties  except those gains and losses from sales of properties upon completion or stabilization under pre sale agreements and after adjustments for unconsolidated investees to reflect their funds from operations on the same basis 
prologis includes the gains and losses generated by cdfs business segment activities in funds from operations see results of operations cdfs business 
funds from operations  as used by prologis  is modified from the nareit definition 
prologis funds from operations measure does not include i deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses of prologis taxable subsidiaries  ii foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from certain debt transactions between prologis and its foreign consolidated subsidiaries  iii foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from certain debt transactions between prologis and its foreign unconsolidated investees  iv foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement based on current foreign currency exchange rates of certain third party debt of prologis foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees  and v mark to market adjustments associated with derivative financial instruments utilized to manage prologis foreign currency risks 
prologis adjustments to the nareit definition are made to reflect prologis funds from operations on a comparable basis with the other reits that do not engage in the same types of transactions that give rise to these items 
funds from operations are as follows for the periods indicated in thousands of us dollars year ended december  net earnings attributable to common shares add deduct real estate related depreciation and amortization gains from contribution and sales of non cdfs business segment assets  net foreign currency exchange gains losses  net deferred income tax expense prologis share of reconciling items of unconsolidated investees real estate related depreciation and amortization write down of operating assets and other impairment charges gains losses from contribution and sales of non cdfs business segment assets  net foreign currency exchange gains losses  net deferred income tax benefit funds from operations attributable to common shares see results of operations other income and expense items foreign currency exchange losses  net

table of contents risk factors prologis operations involve various risks that could adversely affect prologis financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  ability to pay distributions on common shares and the market price of common shares 
these risks include  among others general real estate risks general economic conditions prologis is exposed to the general economic conditions and the local  regional  national and international conditions that affect the markets in which it owns industrial distribution properties 
prologis operating performance depends on the economic conditions of markets in which its distribution properties are concentrated 
while prologis does not have in excess of of its total portfolio including the properties owned by the property funds in any one market  it does have significant holdings in atlanta  chicago  dallas ft 
worth  houston  los angeles  memphis  paris and san francisco 
prologis operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions in these larger markets  such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution properties  become less favorable relative to other geographic areas 
any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction of demand for distribution space could adversely affect prologis operating income and the value of its common shares 
risks particular to real estate real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
while prologis seeks to minimize these risks through geographic diversification  its market research and property management capabilities  these risks cannot be eliminated 
the factors that can affect real estate values include changes in the general economic climate  local conditions  such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for industrial real estate in an area  the quality and philosophy of management  the attractiveness of prologis properties to potential customers  competition from other available properties  prologis ability to provide adequate maintenance of and insurance on its properties  prologis ability to control variable operating costs  governmental regulations  including zoning  usage and tax laws and changes in these laws  and potential liability under  and changes in  environmental  zoning and other laws 
risks associated with concentration of prologis investments in the industrial sector prologis property operations and cdfs business segments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector 
this concentration may expose prologis to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if prologis business activities included other types of real estate investments 
risks associated with prologis development activities prologis has developed a significant number of distribution properties since its inception and intends to continue to pursue development activities as opportunities arise 
such development activities generally require various government and other approvals and prologis may not receive such approvals 
prologis will be subject to risks associated with such development activities including  but not limited to the risk that development opportunities explored by prologis may be abandoned with the related investment written off  
table of contents the risk that construction costs of a property may exceed original estimates or may not be concluded on schedule including the possibility of contract default  the effects of local weather conditions and local or national strikes or shortages in materials  building supplies or energy and fuel for equipment which could make the project less profitable than originally estimated  and the risk that occupancy rates and rents of a completed project will not make the project as profitable as originally estimated 
risks associated with the contribution and sale of properties prologis has contributed to property funds or sold to third parties  a significant number of distribution properties in recent years and prologis intends to continue to contribute or sell properties as opportunities arise  particularly in its cdfs business segment 
prologis ability to contribute or sell properties on advantageous terms is dependent upon several factors  some of which are beyond the control of prologis management  primarily competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties 
prologis ability to develop and lease properties will impact prologis ability to contribute or sell these properties 
continued access to private debt and equity capital by the property funds is necessary in order for prologis to continue its strategy of contributing properties to property funds 
should prologis not have sufficient properties available that meet the investment criteria of current or future property funds  or should the property funds have reduced or no access to capital on favorable terms  then the contributions could be delayed resulting in adverse effects on prologis liquidity and on its ability to meet projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period 
failure to meet its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period could have an adverse effect on prologis results of operations and on the market price of prologis common shares 
further  prologis inability to redeploy the proceeds from its divestitures in accordance with its investment strategy could have an adverse affect on prologis results of operations 
risks associated with acquisition of properties prologis acquires distribution properties from time to time 
the acquisition of properties involves risks  including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and the risks that the actual costs for rehabilitation  renovation and improvements identified in the pre acquisition due diligence process exceed estimates 
there is  and it is expected that there will continue to be  significant competition for investment opportunities that meet prologis investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities  if necessary 
tenant default prologis results of operations and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of prologis tenants are unable to meet their obligations to prologis 
in the event of default by a significant number of tenants  prologis may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing its rights as landlord 
ability to renew leases or re let space as leases expire prologis income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if prologis is unable to lease  on economically favorable terms  a significant amount of space in its distribution properties 
prologis has million square feet out of a total of million occupied square feet of distribution space with leases that expire in and the property funds have a combined million square feet out of a total of million occupied square feet of distribution space with leases that expire in the number of distribution properties in a market or submarket could adversely affect both prologis ability to lease distribution space and the rental rates that can be obtained in new leases 
real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets real estate investments are not as liquid as other types of assets and this lack of liquidity may tend to limit prologis ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  significant 
table of contents expenditures associated with real estate investments  such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments 
like other companies qualifying as reits under the code  prologis must comply with the safe harbor rules relating to the number of properties disposed of in a year  their tax bases and the cost of improvements made to the properties  or meet other tests which enable a reit to avoid punitive taxation on the sale of assets 
thus  prologis ability at any time to sell assets  or contribute assets to property funds or other entities in which prologis has an ownership interest may be restricted 
prologis insurance coverage does not include all potential losses prologis and its unconsolidated investees currently carry comprehensive insurance coverage including property  liability  fire  flood  earthquake  environmental  extended coverage and rental loss as appropriate for the markets where each of their properties and their business operations are located 
the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties and business activities 
prologis believes its properties and the properties of its unconsolidated investees are adequately insured 
however  there are certain losses  including losses from floods and losses from earthquakes  acts of war  acts of terrorism or riots  that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed to be economically feasible or prudent to do so 
however  if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of prologis properties  prologis could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property 
potential environmental liability under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner  developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at  on  under or in its property 
the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release or presence of such hazardous substances 
prologis conducts phase i environmental assessments as part of its due diligence activities 
prologis has not been notified nor is prologis aware of any environmental condition with respect to its real estate assets that are likely to be material to prologis financial condition 
however  prologis cannot give any assurance that such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future 
the presence of such substances on prologis real estate investments could adversely affect its ability to sell such investments or to borrow using such investments as collateral and may also have an adverse effect on prologis cash flow 
financing and capital risks access to capital prologis  as a reit  is required to distribute at least of its taxable income to its shareholders 
consequently  prologis is  as are all reits  dependent on external capital to fund its development and acquisition activities 
prologis has been accessing private debt and equity capital through the establishment of property funds that acquire properties from prologis 
prologis ability to access private debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors  including general market conditions and competition from other real estate companies 
further  prologis generates significant profits as a result of the contributions of properties to the property funds 
to the extent that private capital is not available to acquire properties from prologis  these profits may not be realized which could result in an earnings stream that is less predictable than some of its competitors and result in prologis not meeting its projected earnings levels in a particular reporting period 
failure to meet its projected earnings levels could have an adverse effect on the market price of common shares 
prologis is obligated to offer to contribute its stabilized developed properties in certain specified markets in europe to prologis european properties fund  subject to these properties meeting specified investment criteria through september the subscription agreements with prologis european properties fund s 
table of contents investors expired on september  and all commitments were fully funded prior to expiration 
no assurance can be given that prologis european properties fund will be able to obtain additional sources of equity capital 
prologis ability to contribute or sell its development pipeline and recognize development profits in europe will be jeopardized and prologis ability to meet its projected earnings levels and generate cash flow would be adversely affected should additional equity commitments not be obtained to acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available for contribution om the short term until prologis could sell these properties to third parties 
prologis is obligated to offer to contribute its stabilized developed properties north america except those properties in the los angeles orange county market to prologis north american properties fund v through december  subject to these properties meeting specified investment criteria 
the primary source of capital for prologis north american properties fund v is provided by its majority investor that is a listed property trust in australia 
prologis ability to contribute or sell its development pipeline and recognize development profits in north america will be jeopardized and prologis ability to meet its projected earnings levels and generate cash flow would be adversely affected should prologis north american properties fund v not be successful in raising additional capital such that it can acquire the properties that prologis expects to have available for contribution in the short term until prologis could sell the properties to third parties 
prologis is obligated to offer to contribute its stabilized developed properties in japan to prologis japan properties fund through june  subject to these properties meeting specified investment criteria 
prologis ability to contribute or sell its development pipeline and recognize development profits in japan will be jeopardized and prologis ability to meet its projected earnings levels and generate cash flow would be adversely affected should prologis japan properties fund not receive the committed funds from its majority investor to acquire the properties that prologis expects to be available for contribution 
prologis ability to contribute or sell its development pipeline and recognize development profits in japan would be jeopardized and prologis ability to meet its projected earnings levels and generate cash flow would be adversely affected should this committed capital not be available within the property fund in the short term until prologis could sell the properties to third parties 
limitations on debt prologis currently has a policy of incurring debt only if upon such incurrence  prologis debt to book capitalization ratio  as adjusted  would not exceed 
the board could alter or eliminate this policy without shareholder approval and would do so if  for example  it were necessary in order for prologis to continue with its investment strategy and to continue to meet the reit requirements under the code 
if this policy were changed  prologis could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to shareholders 
debt financing prologis is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that prologis cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest and the risk that prologis will not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that prologis will be able to refinance any indebtedness or otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness 
prologis utilizes the short term borrowing capabilities over billion as of december  provided by six credit agreements that provide revolving line of credit facilities to prologis in addition to operating cash flow and proceeds from dispositions to fund its development  acquisition and distribution requirements 
prologis six revolving lines of credits expire through million during  million during  million during 
prologis ability to refinance these credit agreements in a timely manner and at favorable terms is dependent on several factors including  general economic conditions  prologis credit ratings and interest rate levels 
prologis short term credit agreements bear interest at variable rates 
increases in interest rates would increase prologis interest expense under these 
table of contents agreements 
if prologis is unable to refinance its indebtedness at maturity or meet its payment obligations  the amount of cash available for distribution may be adversely affected 
requirements of credit agreements the terms of prologis various credit agreements and other indebtedness require prologis to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants  such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage 
these covenants may limit prologis flexibility in its operations  and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if prologis has satisfied its payment obligations 
if prologis is unable to refinance its indebtedness at maturity or meet its payment obligations  the amount of cash available for distribution may be adversely affected 
federal income tax risks failure to qualify as a reit could adversely affect shareholders prologis elected to be taxed as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year ended december  to maintain reit status  prologis must meet a number of highly technical requirements on a continuing basis 
those requirements seek to ensure  among other things  that the gross income and investments of a reit are largely real estate related  that a reit distributes substantially all its ordinary taxable income to shareholders on a current basis and that the reit s equity ownership is not overly concentrated 
due to the complex nature of these rules  the available guidance concerning interpretation of the rules  the importance of ongoing factual determinations and the possibility of adverse changes in the law  administrative interpretations of the law and changes in prologis business  no assurance can be given that prologis will qualify as a reit for any particular year 
if prologis fails to qualify as a reit  it will be taxed as a regular corporation  and distributions to shareholders will not be deductible in computing prologis taxable income 
the resulting corporate income tax liabilities could materially reduce the distributable cash flow to prologis shareholders or funds available for reinvestment 
moreover  prologis might not be able to elect to be treated as a reit for the four taxable years after the year during which prologis ceased to qualify as a reit 
in addition  if prologis later requalified as a reit  it might be required to pay a full corporate level tax on any unrealized gain in its assets as of the date of requalification and to make distributions to shareholders equal to any earnings accumulated during the period of non reit status 
in the absence of reit status  distributions to shareholders would no longer be required 
potential adverse effect of reit distribution requirements to maintain its qualification as a reit under the code  prologis must annually distribute to prologis shareholders at least of its ordinary taxable income  excluding net capital gains 
this requirement limits prologis ability to accumulate capital 
prologis may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the distribution requirements 
difficulties in meeting the distribution requirements might arise due to competing demands for prologis funds or to timing differences between tax reporting and cash receipts and disbursements  because income may have to be reported before cash is received  because expenses may have to be paid before a deduction is allowed or because deductions may be disallowed or limited or the internal revenue service may make a determination that adjusts reported income 
in those situations  prologis might be required to borrow funds or sell properties on adverse terms in order to meet the distribution requirements and interest and penalties could apply 
if prologis fails to make a required distribution  it would cease to be a reit 
prohibited transaction income could result from certain property transfers prologis contributes properties to property funds and sells properties to third parties 
some of these contributions and sales are made from prologis taxable subsidiaries 
under the code  if the disposition are deemed to be a prohibited transaction  a penalty tax on the resulting gain could be assessed 
the 
table of contents question of what constitutes a prohibited transaction is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction 
the internal revenue service could contend that certain contributions or sales of properties by prologis are prohibited transactions 
while prologis management does not believe that the internal revenue service would prevail in such a dispute  if the matter was successfully argued by the internal revenue service the penalty tax could be assessed against the profits from these transactions 
additionally  any income from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect prologis ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 
other risks prologis is dependent on key personnel prologis executive officers and other senior offices have a significant role in prologis success 
the ability of prologis to retain its management group or to attract suitable replacements should any members of the management group leave prologis is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market 
the loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation in their availability could adversely effect prologis financial condition and cash flow 
further  such a loss could be negatively perceived in the capital markets 
share prices may be affected by market interest rates the annual distribution rate on common shares as a percentage of its market price may influence the trading price of such common shares 
an increase in market interest rates may lead investors to demand a higher annual distribution rate  which could adversely affect the market price of such common shares 
foreign currency risk prologis has pursued and intends to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets and often invests in countries where the us dollar is not the national currency 
as a result  prologis is subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar 
for example  a significant depreciation in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where prologis has a significant investment may materially adversely affect prologis results of operations 
prologis attempts to mitigate any such effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency put option contracts  although there can be no assurance that such attempts will be successful 
government regulations and actions there are many laws and governmental regulations that are applicable to prologis  its unconsolidated investees and their properties 
changes in these laws and governmental regulations  or their interpretation by agencies or the courts  could occur 
further  economic and political factors  including civil unrest  governmental changes and restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders in the united states  but primarily in the foreign countries in which prologis has invested  can have a major impact on a global company such as prologis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk prologis is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
prologis has used certain derivative financial instruments  primarily foreign currency put option contracts to reduce its foreign currency market risk 
on a limited basis  prologis has used interest rate swap agreements to reduce its interest rate market risk 
prologis does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all financial instruments are entered into in accordance polices that have been approved by the board 
prologis has estimated its market risk exposures using sensitivity analysis 
prologis has defined its market risk exposure as the potential loss in future earnings and cash flow with respect to interest rate 
table of contents exposure and future earnings with respect to foreign currency exchange exposure 
prologis sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical adverse change in year end interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 
the sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value 
as a result  prologis ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period  hedging strategies at the time  and the prevailing interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk prologis interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve its objective for longer term debt  prologis borrows on a fixed rate basis 
therefore  prologis primary interest rate risk is created by its variable rate lines of credit 
although prologis has no interest rate derivatives outstanding at december   prologis has in the past and may in the future  utilize derivative instruments as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions or to fix existing variable rate borrowings to manage its interest rate exposure 
during the year ended december   prologis had weighted average outstanding borrowings of million on its variable rate lines of credit 
based on the results of the sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in interest rates  the estimated market risk exposure for interest rate related financial instruments was approximately million on both future earnings and cash flow for the year ended december  the sensitivity analysis was based on the weighted average outstanding variable rate borrowings for and assumed a flat yield curve for the year 
foreign currency risk prologis primarily uses foreign currency put option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to projected net operating income operating income net of foreign denominated interest expense from its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees 
in addition  prologis incurs foreign currency risk related to third party and intercompany loans of its foreign consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary or investee 
the remeasurement of certain of these loans results in the recognition of foreign currency exchange gains or losses by prologis 
prologis primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rates exists with the following currencies versus the us dollar euro  pound sterling and yen 
based on the results of a sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  the estimated year end market risk exposure to future earnings related to these loans was million 
prologis translates the income and expenses of its consolidated foreign subsidiaries and its proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of its unconsolidated investees recognized under the equity method 
prologis hedges the foreign currency risk associated with approximately of the forecasted net income from its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees through foreign currency put option contracts that are entered into every quarter such that prologis generally has twelve months of income covered under the contracts 
prologis sensitivity analysis  which assumed a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  estimated the year end market risk exposure to future earnings of prologis was million 
the effect of the assumed adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates on translated income and expenses of prologis foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees has a high degree of inverse correlation with the derivative instruments used to hedge it 
however  since prologis hedges approximately of its projected net income from foreign entities  approximately of the impact to the net earnings of its foreign consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees of an adverse movement in foreign exchange rates would not be offset by derivative instruments 
fair value of financial instruments the following estimates of the fair value of financial instruments have been determined by prologis using available market information and valuation methodologies believed to be appropriate for these purposes 

table of contents considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and  accordingly  they are not necessarily indicative of amounts prologis would realize upon disposition 
at december  and  the carrying amounts of certain financial instruments employed by prologis  including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses were representative of their fair values due to the short term maturity of these instruments 
similarly  the carrying values of the lines of credit balances outstanding approximate fair value as of those dates since the interest rates on the revolving lines of credit are based on current market rates 
at december  and  the fair values of prologis senior unsecured debt and secured debt including mortgage notes  assessment bonds and securitized debt have been estimated based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or by discounting the future cash flows using rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities 
the differences in the fair value of prologis senior unsecured debt and secured debt from the carrying value in the table below are the result of differences in the interest rates available to prologis as of december  and  from the interest rates in effect as of the dates the debt was issued 
the senior unsecured debt and many of the secured debt issues contain pre payment penalties or yield maintenance provisions that would make the cost of refinancing the debt exceed the benefit that could be derived from refinancing at the lower rates 
at december  and  the fair value of prologis derivative financial instruments are the amounts at which they could be settled  based on quoted market prices or estimates obtained from brokers or dealers 
as prologis marks its foreign currency put options to market  their fair value is the same as their carrying value 
the carrying value of the foreign currency put option contracts is included with other assets in prologis consolidated balance sheet 
the following table reflects the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of prologis financial instruments as of the periods indicated in thousands of us dollars december  carrying carrying value fair value value fair value senior unsecured debt secured debt foreign currency put option contracts
