item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion below contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of all statements  other than statements of historical fact  the company makes in this document or in any document incorporated by reference are forward looking 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors  which may cause the actual results  performance  or achievements of the company to differ from the projected results 
see business environment and risk factors below 
critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates the us securities and exchange commission sec has issued financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggesting companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies 
in frr  the sec defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results  and require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition the company recognizes the majority of its revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
revenue related to product sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
for product sales with acceptance criteria that are not successfully demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
hardware maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the contracts 
for business units that sell software licenses  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa s statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
license revenue is recognized upon delivery  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  no significant obligations with regards to installation or implementation remain  fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and customer acceptance  when applicable  is obtained 
software maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the contracts 
service revenues are recognized at the time the services are rendered 
the company provides engineering services to some of its customers on a contractual basis and recognizes revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the company estimates the percentage of completion on contracts with fixed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
if the company does not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenue is recognized upon completion of the contract 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  the company accrues for the estimated losses immediately 
revenue related to the hotel operations is recognized as services are performed 
camtronics revenues are derived primarily from the sale of digital cardiac information systems 
system sales revenues consist of the following components computer software licenses  computer hardware  installation support  and sublicensed software 
in addition  camtronics generates revenues related to system sales for software support  hardware maintenance  training  consulting and other professional services 
camtronics recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of sop sop requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the fair values of those elements or by use of the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement when company specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement  which is determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately ie professional services  software support  hardware maintenance  hardware and sublicensed software  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie software solutions 
specifically  camtronics determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the renewal price of the maintenance charged to clients  professional services portion of the arrangement  other than installation services  based on hourly rates which camtronics charges for these services when sold apart from a software license  and the hardware and sublicensed software based on the prices for these elements when they are sold separately from the software 
if evidence of the fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement  the entire amount of revenue under the arrangement is deferred until these elements have been delivered or objective evidence of fair value for the remaining undelivered element is established 
inherent in the revenue recognition process are significant management estimates and judgments  which influence the timing and the amount of revenue recognition 
camtronics provides several models for the procurement of its digital cardiac information systems 
the predominant model includes a perpetual software license agreement  project related installation services  professional consulting services  computer hardware and sub licensed software and software support 
camtronics provides installation services  which include project scoping services  conducting pre installation audits detailed installation plans  actual installation of hardware components  and testing of all hardware and software installed at the customer site 
because installation services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software  software license and installation services fees are recognized upon completion of installation 
camtronics also provides professional consulting services  which include consulting activities that fall outside of the scope of the standard installation services 
these services vary depending on the scope and complexity requested by the client 
examples of such services may include additional database consulting  system configuration  project management  interfacing to existing systems  and network consulting 
professional consulting services generally are not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software  and thus  do not impact the timing of the software license revenue recognition 
professional consulting service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
hardware and software maintenance fees are marketed under annual and multi year arrangements and are recognized as revenue ratably over the contracted maintenance term 
deferred revenue is comprised of license fee  maintenance and other service revenues for which payment has been received and for which services have not yet been performed and revenues related to delivered components of a multiple element arrangement for which fair value has not been determined for components not yet delivered or accepted by the customer 
deferred costs represent costs and related to these revenues  for example  costs of goods sold and services provided and sales commission expenses 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand and changes in technology 
these assessments require management judgments and estimates  and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments 
a reserve of  and  was recorded as of july   respectively 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and accounts receivable 
the company places its cash investments and marketable securities in high credit quality financial instruments and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution 
the company grants credit to domestic and foreign original equipment manufacturers  distributors and end users  and performs ongoing credit evaluations on its customer s financial condition 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collections issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and provisions established  there is no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
since the accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of accounts receivables and future operating results 
warranty reserve the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time products are shipped 
although the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates or service costs differ from the company s estimates  which are based on specific warranty claims  historical data and engineering estimates  where applicable  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
such revisions could adversely affect the company s operating results 
investments in and advances to affiliated companies the company has several investments in affiliated companies related to areas of the company s strategic focus 
the company accounts for these investments using the equity method of accounting 
in assessing the recoverability of these investments  the company must make certain assumptions and judgments based on changes in the company s overall business strategy  the financial condition of the affiliated companies  market conditions and the industry and economic environment in which the entity operates 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of affiliated companies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets intangible assets consist of goodwill  intellectual property  licenses  and capitalized software 
other long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant  and equipment 
intangible assets and property  plant  and equipment  excluding goodwill  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life 
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets is reviewed on a quarterly basis for the existence of facts and circumstances both internally and externally that may suggest impairment 
factors which the company considers important and that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company determines whether an impairment has occurred based on gross expected future cash flows  and measures the amount of the impairment based on the related future discounted cash flows 
the cash flow estimates used to determine impairment  if any  contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company has ceased amortizing goodwill as of august  and will annually review the goodwill for potential impairment  as well as on an event driven basis  using a fair value approach 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that recovery is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established  the company must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal product revenue for fiscal was million as compared with million in fiscal  and increase of or

new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit of disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost as defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
therefore  sfas no 
eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  and  have been adopted by the company as of january  in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses revenue recognition on arrangements encompassing multiple elements that are delivered at different points in time  defining criteria that must be met for elements to be considered to be a separate unit of accounting

business environment and risk factors forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains statements  which  to the extent that they are not recitation of historical facts  constitute forward looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements  including statements about product development  market and industry trends  strategic initiatives  regulatory approvals  sales  profits  expenses  price trends  research and development expenses and trends  and capital expenditures involve risk and uncertainties and actual events and results may differ significantly from those indicated in any forward looking statements as a result of a number of important factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere herein 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision with respect to analogic common stock 
additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business 
any of these could have a material and negative effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
because a significant portion of our revenue currently comes from a small number of customers  any decrease in revenue from these customers could harm our operating results 
we depend on a small number of customers for a large portion of our business  and changes in our customers orders may have a significant impact on our operating results 
if a major customer significantly reduces the amount of business it does with us  there would be an adverse impact on our operating results 
the following table sets forth the percentages of our net product and engineering revenue for our three largest customers in any of the last three fiscal years and the percentage of our total net sales to our ten largest customers in those years year ended july  l communication general electric toshiba philips ten largest customers as a group although we are seeking to broaden our customer base  we will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of major customers 
because it often takes significant time to replace lost business  it is likely that our operating results would be adversely affected if one or more of our major customers were to cancel  delay or reduce significant orders in the future 
our customer agreements typically permit the customer to discontinue future purchases after timely notice 
in addition  we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with the products we sell and the services we provide to our major customers 
although our major customers are large corporations  if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise be unable to pay for our services  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
competition from existing or new companies in the medical and security imaging technology industry could cause us to experience downward pressure on prices  fewer customer orders  reduced margins  the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we are subject to competition based upon product design  performance  pricing  quality and services and we believe our innovative engineering and product reliability have been important factors in our growth 
while we try to maintain competitive pricing on those products which are directly comparable to products manufactured by others  in many instances our products will conform to more exacting specifications and carry a higher price than analogous products manufactured by others 
our competitors include divisions of some larger  more diversified organizations as well as several specialized companies 
some of them have greater resources and larger staffs than we have 
many of our oem customers and potential oem customers have the capacity to design and manufacture the products we manufacture for themselves 
we face competition from research and product development groups and the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers  who continually evaluate the benefits of internal research and product development and manufacturing versus outsourcing 
we depend on our suppliers  some of which are the sole source for our components  and our production would be substantially curtailed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demands and alternative sources are not available 
we order raw materials and components to complete our customers orders  and some of these raw materials and components are ordered from sole source suppliers 
although we work with our customers and suppliers to minimize the impact of shortages in raw materials and components  we sometimes experience short term adverse effects due to price fluctuations and delayed shipments 
in the past  there have been industry wide shortages of electronics components 
if a significant shortage of raw materials or components were to occur  we might have to delay shipments or pay premium pricing  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in some cases  supply shortages of particular components will substantially curtail production of products using these components 
we are not always able to pass on price increases to our customers 
accordingly  some raw material and component price increases could adversely affect our operating results 
we also depend on a small number of suppliers  some of which are affiliated with customers or competitors and others of which may be small  poorly financed companies  for many of the other raw materials and components that we use in our business 
if we are unable to continue to purchase these raw materials and components from our suppliers  our operating results could be adversely affected 
because many of our costs are fixed  our margins depend on our volume of output at our facilities and a reduction in volume could adversely affect our margins 
if we are left with excess inventory  our operating results will be adversely affected 
because of long lead times and specialized product designs  we typically purchase components and manufacture products for customer orders or in anticipation of customer orders based on customer forecasts 
for a variety of reasons  such as decreased end user demand for the products we are manufacturing  our customers might not purchase all the products we have manufactured or for which we have purchased components 
in either event  we would attempt to recoup our materials and manufacturing costs by means such as returning components to our vendors  disposing of excess inventory through other channels or requiring our oem customers to purchase or otherwise compensate us for such excess inventory 
some of our significant customer agreements do not give us the ability to require our oem customers to do this 
to the extent we are unsuccessful in recouping our material and manufacturing costs  not only would our net sales be adversely affected  but also our operating results would be disproportionately adversely affected 
moreover  carrying excess inventory would reduce the working capital we have available to continue to operate and grow our business 
uncertainties and adverse trends affecting our industry or any of our major customers may adversely affect our operating results 
our business depends primarily on a specific segment of the electronics industry  medical and security imaging technology products  which is subject to rapid technological change and pricing and margin pressure 
this industry has historically been cyclical and subject to significant downturns characterized by diminished product demand  rapid declines in average selling prices and production over capacity 
in addition  changes in government policy relating to reimbursement for the purchase and use of medical and security related capital equipment could also affect our sales 
our customers markets are also subject to economic cycles and are likely to experience recessionary periods in the future 
the economic conditions affecting our industry in general  or any of our major customers in particular  might adversely affect our operating results 
our businesses outside the medical instrumentation and security technology product sectors are subject to the same or greater technological and cyclical pressures 
our customers delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for their products could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our products are used by a number of our customers in the production of medical devices that are subject to a high level of regulatory oversight 
a delay or inability to obtain any necessary united states or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for products could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time consuming 
there is a further risk that any approvals or clearances  once obtained  may be withdrawn or modified 
medical devices cannot be marketed in the united states without clearance or approval by the fda 
medical devices sold in the united states must also be manufactured in compliance with fda rules and regulations  which regulate the design  manufacture  packing  storage and installation of medical devices 
moreover  medical devices are required to comply with fda regulations relating to investigational research and labeling 
states may also regulate the manufacture  sale and use of medical devices 
medical device products are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies 
our business strategy involves the pursuit of acquisitions or business combinations  which may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
as part of our business strategy  we may consummate additional acquisitions or business combinations 
acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks  including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses 
if we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future  we may have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources in seeking to complete proposed acquisitions that will not generate benefits for us 
in addition  substantial portions of our available cash might be utilized as consideration for these acquisitions 
our annual and quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations  which could affect the market price of our common stock 
our annual and quarterly results may vary significantly depending on various factors  many of which are beyond our control  and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
these factors include variations in the timing and volume of customer orders relative to our manufacturing capacity  introduction and market acceptance of our customers new products  changes in demand for our customers existing products  the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future orders  effectiveness in managing our manufacturing processes  changes in competitive and economic conditions generally or in our customers markets  changes in the cost or availability of components or skilled labor  foreign currency exposure  and investor and analyst perceptions of events affecting the company  our competitors and or our industry 
as is the case with many technology companies  we typically ship a significant portion of our products in the last month of a quarter 
as a result  any delay in anticipated sales is likely to result in the deferral of the associated revenue beyond the end of a particular quarter  which would have a significant effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  most of our operating expenses do not vary directly with net sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if net sales for a particular quarter were below our expectations  we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter  and  therefore  that revenue shortfall would have a disproportionate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
loss of any of our key personnel could hurt our business because of their industry experience and their technological expertise 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and depend on the services of our key senior executives and our technological experts 
the loss of the services of one or several of our key employees or an inability to attract  train and retain qualified and skilled employees  specifically engineering and operations personnel  could result in the loss of customers or otherwise inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully 
if we are unable to maintain our technological expertise in research and product development and manufacturing processes  we will not be able to successfully compete 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to provide research and product development and manufacturing services that meet the changing needs of our customers 
this requires that we successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in design and manufacturing processes in a cost effective and timely manner 
as a result  we continually evaluate the advantages and feasibility of new product design and manufacturing processes 
we cannot  however  be certain that our development efforts will be successful
