critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition revenue is recognized under statement of position sop as modified by sop  when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
we recognize perpetual license revenues upon delivery of software or  if the customer has evaluation software  delivery of the software key and issuance of the related license  assuming that no significant vendor obligations or customer acceptance rights exist 
where payment terms are extended over periods greater than months  revenue is recognized as such amounts become due and payable 
product sales consist of appliances sold in conjunction with iss licensed software and software developed by third party partners  combined in some instances with associated hardware appliances and partner maintenance services 
these sales are recognized upon shipment to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
license sales of enterprise products are generated both through a direct sales force and through various partners  including system integrators  value added resellers and distributors 
license revenue is recognized when the end user sale has occurred  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met  which is identified through electronic delivery of a software key that is necessary to operate the product 
at the point of key delivery  the end user has no right of return 
license sales of consumer and small office products are made through a distributor to retail establishments and are sold directly to customers via the internet 
license revenue for sales made through resellers and distributors are recognized only when the product is delivered to the end user provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
subscription revenues include maintenance  term licenses  and managed service arrangements 
annual renewable maintenance is a separate component of each perpetual license agreement for iss products with revenue recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
term licenses allow customers to use our products and receive maintenance coverage for a specified period  generally months 
we recognize revenues from these term agreements ratably over the subscription term 
security monitoring services of information assets and systems are part of managed services and revenues are recognized as such services are provided 
professional services revenues include fee based service engagements and training 
service engagements  typically billed on a time and materials basis  primarily focus on security assessments of customer networks and the development of customers security policies 
we recognize such professional services revenues as the related services are rendered 
multiple element arrangements can include any combination of hardware  software or services 
when some elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement  revenue is deferred until the delivery of the last element unless there is all of the following vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements  the functionality of the delivered elements is not dependent on the undelivered elements  and delivery of the delivered elements represents the culmination of the earnings process 
our historical rate of return for our software products is negligible 
we offer demonstration software available via download from our website that allows potential customers to see the functionality of the products on their own networks 
we did not have any transactions in  or involving reciprocal arrangements where goods or services were purchased from an organization at the same time that we licensed software or provided services to that organization 
allowance for doubtful accounts our sales are global  with customers located in the united states  europe  latin america and the asia pacific regions 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customer s financial condition and do not require collateral 
credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of entities that comprise the company s customer base 
we provide for estimated credit losses as such losses become probable 
we evaluate specific accounts when we become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its liquidity or financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on the best facts available to us and is reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts totals of the million of net trade receivables 
our provision for doubtful accounts for the year ended december  amounted to million 
this was an increase from  in and million in weakness in overall global economic conditions in increased our exposure to uncollectible accounts  explaining the increase in the provision from the economic conditions in the asia pacific region  primarily in the northeast asian markets of japan  korea and china  increased our exposure to uncollectible accounts in we performed an internal evaluation of the outstanding receivables in this region and increased our provision by approximately  at december  for such estimated losses 
during  we decreased the provision by  for allowances specifically established for two customers that were successfully collected in finally during  in response to the difficult current economic conditions  we wrote off approximately million of receivables that were deemed uncollectible due to the deteriorating condition of certain customers 
while actual credit losses have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of goodwill in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company adopted sfas no 
as of january  sfas no 
requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and establish a new method for testing goodwill for impairment 
we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
significant judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and products  it is possible that forecasts used to support our intangible assets may change in the future which could result in significant non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently have intangible assets related to goodwill of approximately million  with million related to our june acquisition of network ice 
the determination of whether or not this asset is impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
we have concluded that this amount is realizable based on forecasted discounted cash flows through and on our stock market valuation 
neither method indicated that our goodwill had been impaired and as a result  we did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill during the year ended december  acquisitions we believe that our total solutions approach will positively impact all of our revenue categories 
this includes our products and managed services offerings  as well as maintenance and professional services and training 
while we expect the expansion of these product and service offerings to originate primarily from internal development  our strategy includes acquiring products  technologies and service capabilities that fit within our strategy and potentially accelerate the timing of the commercial introduction of such products and technologies 
on october   we completed the acquisition of privately held vcis of santa clara  california  a developer of patent pending  next generation  pre emptive behavioral inspection technology 
the technology prevents malicious code from executing and causing damage before it has an opportunity to interact with the enterprise network 
the aggregate purchase price was million and was primarily allocated to in process research and development 
in process research and development had not yet reached technological feasibility and was required to be expensed at the time of acquisition under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as a result we incurred an expense of million in the fourth quarter of of the remaining purchase price  million was allocated to the assembled workforce  which is being amortized over years   was allocated to net tangible assets  principally fixed assets  and  of liabilities were assumed 
in august  internet security systems kk iss kk  our asia pacific subsidiary  acquired a distributor in singapore  trisecurity holdings pte ltd 
trisecurity 
trisecurity was the sole distributor for iss kk in southeast asia  including india  and its business was almost exclusively focused on iss solutions 
this acquisition provides our asia pacific subsidiary direct support capabilities for their customers in southeast asia and allows iss kk to expand its capabilities in this growing market 
the consideration consisted of  shares of iss kk stock and approximately million of cash 
goodwill of approximately million related to the purchase was recorded 
there is additional annual contingent consideration dependent on the achievement of specified increasing levels of revenues and operating profits through the total maximum additional consideration at december  is shares of iss kk stock and any shares issued will be recorded as additional purchase price 
on june   we acquired of the outstanding stock of network ice corporation  a privately held corporation based in san mateo  california 
network ice was a leading developer of desktop intrusion protection technology and highly scalable security management systems 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the operating results of network ice are included in the consolidated financial statements of iss from the date of acquisition 
substantially all of the aggregate purchase price of million was allocated to goodwill  with the remainder allocated to identified intangibles  including in process research and development  developed technology  customer relationships  and to deferred compensation related to stock options assumed 
results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated historical operating information  as a percentage of total revenues  for the periods indicated year ended december  consolidated statements of operations data product licenses and sales subscriptions professional services total revenues cost of revenues product licenses and sales subscriptions and professional services total cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative write off of lease obligation charge for in process research and development amortization of intangibles stock based compensation amortization of goodwill total costs and expenses operating income loss revenues product licenses and sales product licenses and sales  including perpetual licenses and sales of partner software and hardware appliances  have been relatively flat at between million and million for the last three years 
they continue to be the primary  but decreasing  source of revenue generation at of total revenues in  in and in as subscription revenues have grown significantly 
within this revenue category  perpetual licenses of our products have grown each year  but the increase has been offset by the decrease in sales of third party products 
the movement away from direct sales of third party products was a conscious effort to simplify our business by focusing on our own iss solutions 
the business of selling third party products arose from our netrex acquisition in we continue the sales of third party products as part of our managed services offerings  otherwise de emphasizing the direct sales of third party products 
third party product revenues decreased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in and in it is our intent to limit future third party sales to current mss related offerings or delivery of iss solutions in appliance offerings that are planned for subscriptions subscriptions revenue represented of total revenues in and increased to of total revenues in and to in subscription revenues consist of maintenance  term licenses of product usage and security monitoring fees for managed services offerings 
the increase in subscriptions revenue as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenues  the largest component  which grew from of total revenues in to in and to in we continue to increase our software client base that generates maintenance revenues  through a combination of maintenance contracts associated with new product licenses and a high renewal rate of existing contracts 
managed services revenues accounted for of total revenues in the year  as compared with in the year and in the year this increase was a result of our continued focus on our intrusion protection offerings  partially offset by decreasing non core service offerings during specifically  we eliminated a security offering combined with internet service provider services in the last quarter of  and eliminated contracts where the partner contracted for capacity  but did not achieve the underlying end user contracts 
in addition  we have had some customers bring firewall management in house 
as a result  management of our products is a larger portion of our managed services business  which we perceive as providing long term value to our customers 
professional services professional services revenue decreased both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue from in to in this followed an increase in absolute dollars in  but a decrease from of revenues in to in during we began narrowing our consulting offerings to focus on services that directly contribute to our protection platform strategy 
this strategy continued in as we focused on high value offerings that utilize our x force expertise  and choose to use partners to provide deployment and other offerings where appropriate 
at the same time  services were impacted by decreased customer spending as entities curtailed costs in the second half of and continued to limit discretionary dollars on professional services in over the past three years we have also decreased the number of education classes related to third party products and increased our emphasis on courses related to iss solutions 
in the future  we intend to have more of our developed course materials delivered to our customers through authorized training centers rather than at our locations 
geographic regions geographically  we derived the majority of our revenues from sales to customers within the americas region 
revenues by region represented the following percentages of total revenues americas emea asia pacific revenues in emea and asia pacific for remained consistent with  with asia pacific down minimally due to difficult economic conditions in portions of the region in the latter part of the financial data for each segment can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in item costs and expenses personnel and related costs represent our largest expense category 
we consistently increased our quarterly headcount for several years until july  when we resized the business as the result of disappointing sales results in the quarter ended june  this resizing included personnel reductions in all areas of the business and decreases in various operating expenses  with emphasis also on controlling discretionary spending and capital expenditures 
cost of product licenses and sales cost of product licenses and sales consists of several components 
costs associated with licensing our products are minor 
substantially all of the cost of product licenses and sales represents payments to partners for their products that we integrate with our products or directly provide to our customers as part of a single solution source 
costs of product revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in and to in  as sales of partner software and hardware appliances represented a lower percentage of total revenues 
the continued decrease as a percent of revenue is consistent with our movement away from the direct sales of third party products  except where related to iss managed services or associated with the delivery of iss products  such as future appliance offerings 
cost of subscriptions and professional services cost of subscriptions and services includes the cost of our technical support personnel who provide assistance to customers under maintenance agreements  the security operations center soc costs of providing managed security monitoring services and the costs related to our professional services and training 
these costs as a percentage of total revenues were in  in and in the percentage increase in cost of subscriptions and professional services from in to in is a result of our significant commitment to subscription and professional services revenues 
we expanded our managed security offering capabilities in terms of automated systems  number of managed security operations centers and personnel resources 
we made an increased investment in automated systems and personnel resources for our asia pacific soc  which began operating in the third quarter of we added professional services capabilities and more automated technical support programs throughout and early as we narrowed the scope of our professional service and educational offerings in the latter half of  we reduced personnel in the consulting and education groups to achieve appropriate gross margins at expected revenue levels 
as a result of our effort to focus on core professional services combined with the difficult economic conditions  costs associated with our professional services and education services decreased as a percentage of total revenues from to costs were controlled through a reduction in personnel that began in the third quarter of  a narrowing of our consulting offerings to focus on services that directly contribute to our protection platform strategy  and a decrease in the number of training classes related to third party products 
costs associated with our technical support personnel and our security operations centers increased in to handle our increasing customer base 
as our subscription revenue base increased we added personnel to handle additional customers under maintenance agreements and under managed security monitoring services  but at a much lower rate than revenue growth 
we gained efficiencies in our security operations centers and restructured our support groups to be more productive 
while we continue to seek increased productivity  we do expect to increase costs with a continued increase in revenues in the future 
research and development research and development expenses consist of salary and related costs of research and development personnel  including costs for employee benefits  and depreciation on computer equipment 
these costs include those associated with maintaining and expanding the x force  our internal team of security experts 
we believe our primary research and product development and managed service offerings are important to retaining our leadership position in the market 
we continue to add functionality to our product family  providing network  server and desktop based solutions  as well as to our security management applications 
in  we provided enhancements to our realsecure protection platform by releasing realsecure network protector  realsecure server sensor and realsecure desktop protector these releases provided several enhancements  including the combining of signature based and anomaly detection technologies  improved scalability and the ability to block network traffic as well as new protection from malicious application execution 
in the first quarter of  we released realsecure siteprotector  an integrated centralized enterprise management console system of our network  server and desktop protection agents 
we also provided enhancements to our vulnerability assessment products as well as realsecure guard  realsecure sentry and realsecure gigabit sentry 
these improvements as well as new offerings are intended to provide our customers with more powerful and easier to use solutions for security management across the enterprise 
research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars from million in to million in and remained constant at of total revenues in both fiscal years 
this increase in absolute dollars is primarily due to the increase in the number of our development personnel focused on our best of breed products  enterprise applications  managed services offerings and research for future product offerings  including the addition of approximately engineers from the june network ice acquisition 
in  these expenses decreased slightly in absolute dollars to million  and decreased to of total revenues as we were able to gain leverage by continuing to provide new product offerings and enhancements without an increase in research and development expenses 
our development group headcount increased in the fourth quarter of due to the addition of engineers from the vcis acquisition 
while we are committed to continue our investment in x force research capabilities that we believe to be a differentiator for iss  we intend to continue to seek more leverage in the research and development area while enhancing current technologies and developing new technologies 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  travel expenses  commissions  advertising  maintenance of our website  trade show expenses  costs of recruiting sales and marketing personnel and costs of marketing materials 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in and million in sales and marketing expenses increased to of total revenues in from in due to several factors 
more difficult economic conditions in resulted in increased sales and marketing efforts in order to achieve our targets  especially after our disappointing results for the second quarter of additionally  we incurred severance costs in the third quarter of as a result of our headcount reduction 
gaining leverage in sales and marketing was a key objective for us in  and we were able to decrease these expenses as a percentage of total revenues to in this occurred partly because we resized our operations in the third quarter of  resulting in personnel reductions and decreases in various operating expenses 
in areas where revenue demand did not support our cost base  such as latin america and europe  we reduced headcount further in the third quarter of at the same time  we have increased headcount where we believe there are near term opportunities  such as our united states public sector  which handles opportunities on the federal  state and local levels 
we also continue to achieve leverage in our sales and marketing efforts by focusing our direct sales force and continued expansion of the channel as a source of product sales 
the channel continues to be an important source of global revenue for us as we use its capabilities to reach not just departmental and small companies  but larger customers as well 
although we decreased our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues  we did increase our advertising costs 
in the first half of  we launched our first television and print advertising campaign designed to demonstrate the multitude of threats that can compromise the security of a company s networks  servers or desktops 
this campaign was aimed at increasing awareness of the iss brand  especially at the mainstream business market 
we intend to continue to expand our channel sales capabilities  focus on controlling discretionary spending and capital expenditures and adjust our organization in light of economic conditions 
while we expect to continue to gain leverage in our sales and marketing costs in the future  our ability to do so will be largely dependent on economic and competitive conditions in future periods 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses of million in  million in and million in  represented approximately of our total revenues in  in and in general and administrative expenses consist of personnel related costs for executive  administrative  finance and human resources  internal information systems and other support services costs  and legal  accounting and other professional service fees 
the increase in these expenses from to is partially attributable to our efforts  through additional employees and systems  to enhance our management s ability to obtain and analyze information about our domestic and international operations  and to support a larger employee base  as well as the expansion of our facilities 
in november we began occupying our corporate headquarters in atlanta and moved the balance of our atlanta personnel in the first quarter of  incurring expenses associated with the move 
the third quarter of included severance  contract termination and office consolidation costs that caused general and administrative costs to increase in this period 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from to includes non recurring expenses associated with a relocation of our asia pacific headquarters in tokyo during the second quarter of costs included lease termination costs  including remaining rent payments  write off of leasehold improvements and moving costs 
excluding this impact  general and administrative expenses remained at of total revenues in write off of lease obligation in the first quarter of  we completed the relocation of our atlanta personnel into our corporate headquarters 
we recorded a million charge resulting from the write off of the remaining lease obligation through june on our previous atlanta headquarters office space 
this non recurring expense originated in the first quarter of  as available subleased space in the area grew substantially in the quarter as the result of layoffs  closures and consolidations  reducing the prospects of subleasing our old space 
charge for in process research and development we have reflected charges of million in and million in for the write offs of in process research and development costs associated with the network ice acquisition in june and the vcis acquisition in october in process research and development had not reached technological feasibility based on identifiable technological risk factors which indicated that even though successful completion was expected  it was not assured at the acquisition date and was immediately charged to operations 
vcis was developing a protection kernel that uses behavior analysis technology to identify viruses  trojans  worms  and other forms of malicious code 
the technology operates on classes of viruses rather than on individual viruses 
it conducts real time assessments of all executable program files  in a safe environment  and cleans the files before they are allowed to execute within an actual system 
at the time the merger transaction was concluded  the vcis technology had not reached technological feasibility 
vcis had no marketable product and several key components of the technology had not been completed 
furthermore  the company has not identified any alternative uses for the technology at its current stage of development 
the value of the vcis in process technology was estimated using the excess earnings method  a form of the income approach that quantifies the cash flow attributable to intangible assets 
the excess earnings method captures the value of an intangible asset by discounting to present value the earnings of the asset that remain after a deduction for a return on contributory assets 
contributory assets normally include working capital  fixed assets  and other intangible assets 
after a fair return on tangible and other intangible assets is subtracted  the remaining excess cash flow is attributed to the intangible asset being valued 
the excess earnings method explicitly recognizes that the current value of an investment is premised upon the expected receipt of future economic benefits  such as cost savings  periodic income  or sale proceeds 
indications of value are developed by discounting future net cash flows attributed to the technologies to their present value at a rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market and  in the case of the in process technology  the risks inherent in the completion of the development efforts 
for purposes of valuing the in process research and development  iss management projected revenue and costs for the vcis business 
the company identified three potential applications for the technology that had differing time tables for completion 
in identifying the potential future cash flow from the technology  the first two applications were assumed to be generally available in early to mid  while the last of the three was assumed to be generally available at the beginning of total cost to complete the technology for use in all three applications was assumed to be million 
these assumptions have a degree of uncertainty given that this is new  unproven technology 
as evidence of such uncertainty  the timing of the availability of these applications has been extended to either the latter part of or the first half of the technology was assumed to have a total life of years  however  revenue attributable to the technology was assumed to begin decreasing after approximately years 
revenue attributable to the technology was assumed to be million for and is assumed to grow at various rates averaging approximately until when it begins decreasing 
we have assumed costs of goods sold  including cost of providing support  to be of revenue 
in addition  general and administrative expenses are assumed to be of revenue and selling and marketing expenses are assumed to be of revenue 
when computing the discounted cash flows associated with each potential application  we adjusted the discount rate to reflect the different level of risk associated with longer development cycle 
in other words  because the third application required more additional development that the other two  there is a higher level of risk that this project will ultimately be successful 
an independent investor would require a higher rate of return to compensate for this additional risk 
the discount rate used to determine present value was for the two earlier applications  and for the last application 
amortization we incurred amortization expense related to intangible assets and stock based compensation of  in  million in and million in these intangible assets and stock based compensation resulted from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are amortized over their useful lives 
the increase from to resulted from our june acquisition of network ice 
intangibles from acquisitions will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
effective january   under the provisions of sfas goodwill will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to annual tests for impairment 
based on the results of our impairment analysis for  amortization charges related to goodwill were eliminated in after totaling million in interest income net interest income decreased from million in to million in and to million in the decrease in interest income year over year resulted from lower market rates of interest on debt securities 
the market rate of interest paid on investment quality commercial paper and similar investments dropped from approximately during to approximately during and dropped to approximately for as a result  interest income decreased despite an increase in cash and cash equivalents and interest bearing marketable securities 
minority interest minority interest totaled  in and  in minority interest represents the portion of earnings that would be distributed to shares not held by us if the asia pacific subsidiary declared a dividend equal to its earnings 
this minority interest was created from the march sales of approximately of the outstanding shares of the asia pacific rim subsidiary to employees and key partners and the september sales of newly issued shares equal to approximately of its previously outstanding shares in an initial public offering on the japan over the counter market 
other income  net other income of million in includes a gain of million from an initial public offering on the japan over the counter market by our subsidiary responsible for asia pacific operations 
proceeds of the ipo were retained by the subsidiary 
the gain represents the amount by which the offering price exceeded the carrying amount of subsidiary stock in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
it also includes a million gain from the sale of approximately of the outstanding shares of our asia pacific subsidiary that was recorded in march in accordance with sab as part of the planning for an ipo in japan of a minority interest in our asia pacific subsidiary  which was completed in september  options were granted in the subsidiary as a means of key employee retention and approximately of the outstanding shares were sold to employees and key partners 
the gain represents the difference between proceeds received and the underlying basis in the stock 
in  other income of million includes a third quarter gain of million related to the issuance of subsidiary shares in connection with the acquisition of trisecurity holdings pte ltd 
the company reported a gain on the difference between the fair market value of the shares issued and the book value of those shares in accordance with sab adopted by the company 
it also includes a million gain recorded in the second quarter of on the sale of an investment in an iss distributor in japan 
the shares of the publicly traded company were acquired when the distributor was privately held and were subsequently sold on the open market 
foreign currency exchange gain loss the exchange loss of  in and  in and the exchange gain of  in are a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies  primarily the euro and the japanese yen and changes in value of assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in  million in  and million in while income tax expense was recorded on domestic income for each year  taxes payable were reduced by deductions related to the value of employee exercise of stock options 
the tax benefit for the use of these stock option deductions was recorded as additional paid in capital 
taxes paid generally relate to foreign operations 
the effective tax rate was   and for   and  respectively 
the effective rates for and differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of acquisition related intangibles that are not deductible for income tax purposes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million related to stock option deductions that expire in varying amounts between and the tax benefit for this carryforward will be recorded as additional paid in capital when it is realized 
we also have approximately million of research and development tax credit carryforwards  which expire between and and foreign tax credit carryforwards of million that expire between and liquidity and capital resources our financial position remained strong throughout despite a general economic downturn 
our cash and cash equivalents and marketable security investments increased from million at december  to million at december  our investments in marketable securities consist solely of highly rated debt obligations with maturities of months or less 
during  we met our working capital needs and capital equipment needs with cash provided by operations 
cash provided by operations in totaled million compared to million in and million in accounts receivable  net of acquisitions  increased million in compared to a decrease of million in and an increase of million in these changes were primarily the result of changes in sales levels in the fourth quarter of the respective periods  decreasing from to and increasing from to we measure our accounts receivable management by our daily sales outstanding dso 
this is a measurement of accounts receivable divided by billings in the quarter  represented by the sum of revenues plus the change in the deferred revenues liability account balance 
this measurement was  and days at december   and  respectively 
our investing activities of million in included the purchase of million of intermediate term marketable securities  primarily interest bearing government obligations and commercial paper  offset by net proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities of million 
these assets have quality characteristics similar to cash equivalents  except their maturities when we acquire them are longer than three months 
since the initial phase of our atlanta headquarters facility was completed in and the growth in our employment has slowed  we were able to decrease our equipment investment 
we invested in equipment totaling million in compared to million in  as we provided existing and new personnel with improved computer hardware and incurred leasehold improvement costs related primarily to a new asia pacific headquarters in tokyo 
our financing activities provided million of cash in our financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options by our employees and from the issuance of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan  and the use of cash to repurchase shares of our common stock 
in july we announced our plan to repurchase up to million of our common stock over the following twelve months utilizing cash on hand and cash flow generated from operations 
in we purchased  shares of our common stock on the open market at an aggregate cost of million 
other than our non cancelable operating leases for office space  we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements  any relationships with structured finance or special purpose entities  or any contractual obligations that would impact our liquidity 
payments for certain operating leases are secured by three collateralized stand by letters of credit totaling approximately million 
the stand by letters of credit are annually renewable over the duration of the applicable leases 
we do not anticipate utilizing these stand by letters of credit to provide any liquidity needs 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  consisting primarily of money market accounts and investment grade commercial paper 
an additional million of commercial paper investments are pledged as collateral for stand by letters of credit related to the operating leases of our facilities and are shown on the balance sheet as restricted marketable securities 
we believe that such cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  we are not aware of any trends  events  or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in any significant change to our liquidity 
from time to time  we evaluate possible acquisition and investment opportunities in businesses  products or technologies that are complementary to ours 
in the event we determine to pursue such opportunities  we may use our available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities for this purpose 
pending such uses  we will continue to invest our available cash in investment grade  interest bearing investments 
risk factors forward looking statements are inherently uncertain as they are based on various expectations and assumptions concerning future events and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
our forward looking statements contained in this annual report and elsewhere should be considered in light of the following important risk factors 
variations from our stated intentions or failure to achieve objectives could cause actual results to differ from those projected in our forward looking statements 
with respect to our business outlook published in our earnings press release each quarter  you may continue to rely on the revenue and earnings expectations prior to the start of our quiet period unless we have published a notice stating otherwise 
toward the end of each quarter  we have a quiet period when we will not comment concerning the previously published financial expectations  and we disclaim any obligation to update during the quiet period 
the public should not rely on previously published expectations during the quiet period 
the quiet period runs from the th of the last month of the quarter until our earnings release during the first month of the following quarter 
we otherwise undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
we operate in a rapidly evolving market we operate in a new and rapidly evolving market and must  among other things respond to competitive developments  continue to upgrade and expand our product and services offerings  and continue to attract  retain and motivate our employees 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully address these issues 
as a result  we cannot assure our investors that we will be able to continue to operate profitably in the future 
our future operating results will likely fluctuate significantly we cannot predict our future revenues and operating results with certainty 
however  we do expect our future revenues and operating results to fluctuate due to a combination of factors  including the growth in the acceptance of  and activity on  the internet and the world wide web  particularly by corporate  institutional and government users  the extent to which the public perceives that unauthorized access to and use of online information are threats to network security  the volume and timing of orders  including seasonal trends in customer purchasing  our ability to develop new and enhanced product and managed service offerings and expand our professional services capabilities  the introduction of iss branded appliances  including increased cost of goods sold  our ability to provide scalable managed services offerings through our partners in a cost effective manner  foreign currency exchange rates that affect our international operations  product and price competition in our markets  and general economic conditions  both domestically and in our foreign markets 
we increasingly focus our efforts on sales of enterprise wide security solutions  which consist of our entire product suite and related professional services  and managed security services  rather than on the sale of component products 
as a result  each sale requires substantial time and effort from our sales and support staff 
in addition  the revenues associated with particular sales vary significantly depending on the number of products licensed by a customer  the number of devices used by the customer and the customer s relative need for our professional services 
large individual sales  or even small delays in customer orders  can cause significant variation in our license revenues and results of operations for a particular period 
the timing of large orders is usually difficult to predict and  like many software and services companies  many of our customers typically complete transactions in the last month of a quarter 
we cannot predict our operating expenses based on our past results 
instead  we establish our spending levels based in large part on our expected future revenues 
as a result  if our actual revenues in any future period fall below our expectations  our operating results likely will be adversely affected because very few of our expenses vary with our revenues 
because of the factors listed above  we believe that our quarterly and annual revenues  expenses and operating results likely will vary significantly in the future 
our ability to provide timely guidance and meet the expectations of investors with respect to our operating and financial results is impacted by the tendency of a majority of our sales to be completed in the last month of a quarter 
we may not be able to determine whether we will experience material deviations from guidance or expectations until the end of a quarter 
we face intense competition in our market the market for network security monitoring  detection and response solutions is intensely competitive  and we expect competition to increase in the future 
we cannot guarantee that we will compete successfully against our current or potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater financial resources or brand name recognition 
our chief competitors generally fall within one of five categories internal information technology departments of our customers and the consulting firms that assist them in formulating security systems  relatively smaller software companies offering relatively limited applications for network and internet security  large companies  including symantec corp 
and cisco systems  inc  that sell competitive products and offerings  as well as other large software companies that have the technical capability and resources to develop competitive products  software or hardware companies like cisco systems  inc that could integrate features that are similar to our products into their own products  and small and large companies with competitive offerings to components of our managed services offerings 
mergers or consolidations among these competitors  or acquisitions of small competitors by larger companies  represent risks 
for example  symantec s acquired recourse technologies and riptech inc in the third quarter of and cisco recently announced agreements to acquire psionic software  inc and okena  inc these acquisitions will make these entities potentially more formidable competitors to us if such products and offerings are effectively integrated 
large companies may have advantages over us because of their longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases or greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they can also devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
in addition  these companies have reduced and could continue to reduce  the price of their security monitoring  detection and response products and managed security services  which increases pricing pressures within our market 
several companies currently sell software products such as encryption  firewall  operating system security and virus detection software that our customers and potential customers have broadly adopted 
some of these companies sell products that perform the same functions as some of our products 
in addition  the vendors of operating system software or networking hardware may enhance their products to include the same kinds of functions that our products currently provide 
the widespread inclusion of comparable features to our software in operating system software or networking hardware could render our products obsolete  particularly if such features are of a high quality 
even if security functions integrated into operating system software or networking hardware are more limited than those of our software  a significant number of customers may accept more limited functionality to avoid purchasing additional software 
for the above reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we face rapid technological change in our industry and frequent introductions of new products rapid changes in technology pose significant risks to us 
we do not control nor can we influence the forces behind these changes  which include the extent to which businesses and others seek to establish more secure networks  the extent to which hackers and others seek to compromise secure systems  evolving computer hardware and software standards  changing customer requirements  and frequent introductions of new products and product enhancements 
to remain successful  we must continue to change  adapt and improve our products in response to these and other changes in technology 
our future success hinges on our ability to both continue to enhance our current line of products and professional services and to introduce new products and services that address and respond to innovations in computer hacking  computer technology and customer requirements 
we cannot be sure that we will successfully develop and market new products that do this 
any failure by us to timely develop and introduce new products  to enhance our current products or to expand our professional services capabilities in response to these changes could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our products involve very complex technology  and as a consequence  major new products and product enhancements require a long time to develop and test before going to market 
because this amount of time is difficult to estimate  we have had to delay the scheduled introduction of new and enhanced products in the past and may have to delay the introduction of new and enhanced products in the future 
the techniques computer hackers use to gain unauthorized access to  or to sabotage  networks and intranets are constantly evolving and increasingly sophisticated 
furthermore  because new hacking techniques are usually not recognized until used against one or more targets  we are unable to anticipate most new hacking techniques 
to the extent that new hacking techniques harm our customers computer systems or businesses  affected or prospective customers may believe that our products are ineffective  which may cause them or prospective customers to reduce or avoid purchases of our products 
risks associated with our global operations the expansion of our international operations includes our presence in dispersed locations throughout the world  including throughout europe and the asia pacific and latin america regions 
our international presence and expansion exposes us to risks not present in our us operations  such as the difficulty in managing an organization spread over various countries located across the world  compliance with  and unexpected changes in  a wide range of complex regulatory requirements in countries where we do business  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities and potentially adverse tax consequences  excess taxation due to overlapping tax structures  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates resulting in losses or gains from transactions and expenses denominated in foreign currencies  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  reduced protection for enforcement of creditor and contractual rights in some countries  and import and export license requirements and restrictions on the import and export of certain technology  especially encryption technology and trade restrictions 
we rely on distributors extensively in the asia pacific region for the sale and distribution of our products 
further  countries in the asia pacific region  particularly china  japan and korea  have experienced weakness in their currency  banking and equity markets 
these weaknesses could continue to adversely affect our distributors ability to pay us and adversely affect demand for our products in the asia pacific region 
despite these risks  we believe that we must continue to expand our operations in international markets to support our growth 
to this end  we intend to establish additional foreign sales operations  expand our existing offices  hire additional personnel  expand our international sales channels and customize our products for local markets 
if we fail to execute this strategy  our international sales growth will be limited 
our networks  products and services may be targeted by hackers like other companies  our websites  networks  information systems  products and services may be targets for sabotage  disruption or misappropriation by hackers 
as a leading network security solutions company  we are a high profile target 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation  and to respond to such situations  we expect these efforts by hackers to continue 
if these efforts are successful  our operations  reputation and sales could be adversely affected 
we must successfully integrate acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we have and may continue to acquire or make investments in companies with products  technologies or professional services capabilities complementary to our solutions 
when engaging in acquisitions  we could encounter difficulties in assimilating or completing the development of the technologies  new personnel and operations into our company 
these difficulties may disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
these difficulties could also include accounting requirements  such as impairment charges related to goodwill or expensing in process research and development costs as occurred in the fourth quarter of related to the acquisition of vcis 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully overcome these risks with respect to any future acquisitions or that we will not encounter other problems in connection with our recent or any future acquisitions 
in addition  any future acquisitions may require us to incur debt or issue equity securities 
the issuance of equity securities could dilute the investment of our existing stockholders 
we depend on our intellectual property rights and use licensed technology we rely primarily on copyright  trademark  patent and trade secrets laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we have obtained one united states patent and have a number of patent applications pending  as well as numerous trademarks and trademark applications pending 
we believe that the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  our name recognition  our professional services capabilities and delivery of reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position 
we cannot assure you that our competitors will not develop technologies that are similar to ours 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
while we cannot determine the extent to which piracy of our software products occurs  we expect software piracy to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as us government agencies and private parties 
some provisions in the iss certificate of incorporation and bylaws make a takeover of iss difficult our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of iss 
these provisions establish a classified board of directors  create preferred stock purchase rights that grant to holders of common stock the right to purchase shares of series a junior preferred stock in the event that a third party acquires or more of the voting power of our outstanding common stock  prohibit the right of our stockholders to act by written consent  limit calling special meetings of stockholders  and impose a requirement that holders of of the outstanding shares of common stock are required to amend the provisions relating to the classification of our board of directors and action by written consent of stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of high quality relatively short term investments  including commercial paper and overnight repurchase agreements 
as of december   million of our securities mature in more than three months and million of our securities mature in more than six months  but in all cases less than one year 
risk associated with foreign exchange rates iss is subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of exposures to changes in currency exchange rates 
our foreign operations are  for the most part  naturally hedged against exchange rate fluctuations since both revenues and expenses of each foreign affiliate are denominated in the same currency 
therefore  we do not engage in formal hedging activities  but we do periodically review the potential impact of this risk to ensure that the risk of significant potential losses remains minimal 
as a result  an unfavorable change in the exchange rate for any particular foreign subsidiary would result in lower revenues and expenses with regards to operating results  and lower assets and liabilities with regards to the balance sheet 
the company s operating results are affected by changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro and the japanese yen 
when the us dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies  the value of our non functional currency revenues decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the value of our functional currency revenues increases 
since much of our international operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies  which is the foreign subsidiaries functional currency  the impact of exchange rates on net income or loss is relatively less than the impact on revenue 
although our operating and pricing strategies take into account changes in exchange rates over time  our results of operations may be affected significantly in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
during  the company recorded a net foreign exchange loss of  the nature and extent of the foreign currency risk faced by the company depends on many factors that cannot be accurately predicted 
these factors include significant changes in foreign currency market conditions  the company s inability to match foreign currency denominated revenues with costs denominated in the same currency  and changes in the amount or mix of revenues denominated in various foreign currencies 
as a result of material unforeseen changes in these factors  the company s foreign currency risk could have a greater impact on the company s results of operations in the future
