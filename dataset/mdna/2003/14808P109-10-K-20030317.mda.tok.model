item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following presents management s discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations as of the dates and for the periods indicated 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with item business  item selected consolidated financial data  the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in item and other financial data appearing in this report 
critical accounting policies the company has prepared all of the consolidated financial information in this report in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
management has identified the accounting policy related to the allowance for loan losses as critical to the understanding of the company s results of operations  since the application of this policy requires significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different amounts to be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed in the allowance and provision for loan losses section of this report 
in addition  management evaluates certain long term assets such as premises and equipment  goodwill  and foreclosed assets for impairment 
generally  recognition of impairment is required when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets will not be recoverable in the future 
if impairment occurs  various methods of measuring impairment may be called for depending on the circumstances and type of asset  including quoted market prices  estimates based on similar assets  and estimates based on valuation techniques such as discounted projected cash flows 
assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
the application of this policy also requires significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different results if conditions or underlying circumstances change 
net income summary the results compared to include the following significant pre tax components net interest income after provision for loan losses decreased  or due primarily to the decrease in the general level of interest rates and partially due to an increase of  in the provision for loan losses

net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans  investments  and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is the most significant source of the company s revenues 
net interest income in compared to on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income for totaled  a decrease of  or from the net interest margin for was compared to in the following factors account for this decrease in net interest income and net interest margin the dramatic decrease in the general level of interest rates significantly impacted the company s net interest income and margin 
the prime rate decreased from at the beginning of to at the end of and at the end of also  the federal funds rate ended the year at  the lowest level in over years 
the average yield on earning assets decreased to in from in the company is negatively affected by decreases in the level of interest rates due to the fact that its rate sensitive assets significantly exceed its rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  the company is positively affected by increases in the level of interest rates 
this is primarily due to the noninterest bearing liabilities generated by the company in the form of accounts and drafts payable 
more information is contained in item a of this report 
the company partially offset these decreases through both an increase in earning assets and shift of investments to higher yielding assets 
total average earning assets increased  or to  this increase was funded by an increases in deposits generated by the bank 
the bank saw increases in both interest bearing deposits  as a result of increased marketing efforts  and noninterest bearing deposits  mainly from bank customers that maintained higher balances to compensate the bank for services and to avoid increased service fees in a lower rate environment 
total average loans increased  or to  this increase was attributable to new business relationships and funded by the increase in deposit liabilities and reallocation of assets 
this increase in loans had a positive effect on interest income and the net interest margin due to the fact that loans are one of the company s highest yielding earning assets 
total average investment in debt and equity securities increased  or to  in addition to this increased investment  the company shifted its purchase of securities from taxable to tax exempt due to the higher tax equivalent yield such investments produce 
this increase and shift also allowed the company to offset the effect of lower interest rates 
total average federal funds sold and other short term investments decreased  or to  these are the lowest yielding earning assets so decreases in these funds have a positive effect on net interest margin 
in another attempt to offset the effect of declining interest rates the company shifted excess short term funds to higher yielding investments 
net interest income in compared to on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income for totaled  an increase of  or over the net interest margin for was compared to in the following factors account for this increase in net interest income and decrease in net interest margin total average earning assets increased  or to  this increase was funded by an increase in average accounts and drafts payable and an increase in deposit liabilities generated by the bank 
the company s accounts and drafts payable increased due to an increase in dollars processed and a lengthening of the time funds were available for investment 
the time funds are available for investment is negotiated by customer and is part of the compensation for providing the company s services 
the bank saw an increase in both interest bearing deposits  as a result of increased marketing efforts  and noninterest bearing deposits  mainly from bank customers that maintained higher balances to compensate the bank for services and to avoid increased service fees in a lower rate environment 
the interest generated from the increase in average earning assets was offset by a decrease in the general level of interest rates 
total average loans increased  or to  this increase was attributable to new business relationships and funded by the increase in payables and deposit liabilities 
this increase in loans increased interest income and had a positive effect on the net interest margin due to the fact that loans are one of the company s highest yielding earning assets 
total average federal funds sold and other short term investments increased  or to  since these are the lowest yielding earning assets  increases in average balances outstanding can increase interest income but may lower the yield on earning assets and decrease the net interest margin 
the net interest margin decreased primarily because of the dramatic decrease in the general level of interest rates 
prime decreased from at the end of to at the end of also  the federal funds rate ended the year at  at that time the lowest level in nearly years 
the average yield on earning assets decreased to in from in the company is negatively affected by decreases in the level of interest rates due to the fact that its rate sensitive assets significantly exceed its rate sensitive liabilities

the company has no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans which are not otherwise disclosed in the loan portfolio composition table and discussed in item  note of this report 
as can be seen in the loan composition table above and discussed in item  note  the company s primary market niche for banking services is privately held commercial companies and churches and church related ministries 
loans to the commercial entities are generally secured by the business assets of the company  including accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and equipment  and the building s from which the company operates 
operating lines of credit to these companies generally are secured by accounts receivable and inventory  with specific percentages of each determined on a customer by customer basis  based on various factors including the type of business 
intermediate term credit for machinery and equipment is generally provided at some percentage of the value of the equipment purchased  depending on the type of machinery or equipment purchased by the entity 
loans secured exclusively by real estate to businesses and churches are generally made with a maximum loan to value ratio  depending upon the company s estimate of the resale value and ability of the property to generate cash 
the company s loan policy requires an independent appraisal for all loans over  secured by real estate 
company management monitors the local economy in an attempt to determine whether it has had a significant deteriorating effect on such real estate credits 
when problems are identified  appraised values are updated on a continual basis  either internally or through an updated external appraisal 
loan portfolio changes from december  to december  total loans increased  or to  this increase was due mainly to the expansion of church and church related loans in the st

the larger provisions made in and partially resulted from the increase in average loans outstanding and the increases in nonperforming loans 
loan charge offs  net of recoveries  experienced by the company were  in   in and  in the allowance for loan losses was  at december   compared to  at december  and  at december  the year end allowance represented of outstanding loans  compared to at year end and at year end from december  to december  the level of nonperforming loans increased  from  to  which represents of outstanding loans 
nonperforming loans are more fully explained in the section entitled nonperforming assets in item of this report 
the allowance for loan losses has been established and is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
an ongoing assessment of risk of loss is performed to determine if the current balance of the allowance is adequate to cover probable losses in the portfolio 
a charge or credit is made to expense to cover any deficiency or reduce any excess 
the current methodology employed to determine the appropriate allowance consists of two components  specific and general 
the company develops specific valuation allowances on commercial  commercial real estate  and construction loans when a loan is considered to be impaired 
a loan is impaired when  based on an evaluation of current information and events  it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due principal and interest pursuant to the original contractual terms 
the company measures impairment based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the general component relates to all other loans  which are evaluated based on loan grade 
the loan grade assigned to each loan is typically evaluated on an annual basis  unless circumstances require interim evaluation 
the company assigns a reserve amount consistent with each loan s rating category 
the reserve amount is based on loss experience over prescribed periods 
in addition to the amounts derived from the loan grades  a portion is added to the general reserve to take into account other factors including national and local economic conditions  downturns in specific industries including loss in collateral value  trends in credit quality at the company and the banking industry  and trends in risk rating changes 
as part of their examination process  federal and state agencies review the company s methodology for maintaining the allowance for loan losses and the balance in the account 
these agencies may require the company to increase the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and interpretations about information available to them at the time of their examination

nonperforming assets it is the policy of the company to continually monitor its loan portfolio and to discontinue the accrual of interest on any loan on which payment of principal or interest in a timely manner  in the normal course of business  is doubtful 
subsequent payments received on such loans are applied to principal if there is any doubt as to the collectibility of such principal  otherwise  these receipts are recorded as interest income 
interest on nonaccrual and renegotiated loans  which would have been recorded under the original terms of the loans  was approximately  for the year ended december  of this amount  approximately  was actually recorded as interest income on such loans 
at december   after review of potential problem loans identified by management  including those noted in the table below  management of the company concluded the allowance for loan losses was adequate 
as of december   approximately  of loans not included in the table below were identified by management as having potential credit problems  resulting in a total of  in impaired loans

the accounts and drafts payable generated by the company has also historically been a stable source of funds 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared with  for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was  compared with net cash provided of  for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in investing activities relates primarily to the sales of securities during the year ended december  and was partially offset by the purchase of more debt and equity securities  increases in loan balances and the investment in bank owned life insurance 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities compared with net cash provided for the year ended december  relates primarily to the decrease in accounts and drafts payable at december  balances in accounts and drafts payable can vary significantly from day to day due to the company s payment cycle and therefore balances on any one particular day are not necessarily reflective of balances throughout the year 
the decrease in accounts and drafts payable at december  was partially offset by short term borrowings 
other off balance sheet activities in the normal course of business  the company is party to activities that contain credit  market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the company s consolidated financial statements 
such activities include traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments and commitments under operating leases 
for details of operating leases refer to item  note of this report 
the company provides customers with off balance sheet credit support through unused loan commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit 
summarized credit related financial instruments  including both commitments to extend credit and letters of credit at december  are as follows amount of commitment expiration per period less than dollars in thousands at december  total year years years unused loan commitments    standby letters of credit    commercial letters of credit since many of the unused commitments are expected to expire or be only partially used  the total amount of commitments in the preceding table does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
capital resources one of management s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital base to warrant the confidence of customers  shareholders  and bank regulatory agencies 
a strong capital base is needed to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities that arise and to provide assurance to depositors and creditors 
the company and its banking subsidiary continue to exceed all regulatory capital requirements  as evidenced by the capital ratios at december  as shown in item  note of this report 
in  cash dividends paid were 
per share for a total of  a increase over the prior year  which is attributable to both an increase in the per share amount paid and an increase in the number of shares outstanding 
on december  the company issued a stock dividend payable to holders of record on december  and also paid an additional 
per share over the per share amounts paid for each of the quarters of and the first three quarter of shareholders equity was  or of total assets at december   an increase of  over the balance at december  this increase resulted from net income of  an increase in other comprehensive income of  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  and other items of  which was partially offset by cash dividends paid of  repurchases of stock of  and  for payments of fractional shares related to the stock dividend 
management believes that current cash  cash equivalents  maturing investments and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and capital expenditures in dividends from the bank subsidiary are a significant source of funds for payment of dividends by the company to its shareholders 
the only restrictions on dividends are those dictated by regulatory capital requirements and prudent and sound banking principles 
as of december   unappropriated retained earnings of  were available at the bank for the declaration of dividends to the company without prior approval from regulatory authorities 
effect of recent and prospective accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 

this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligation under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of periods ending after december  and are included in item  note of this report 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 

this statement amends sfas accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and are included in item  note of this report 
effects of inflation the company s assets and liabilities are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  cash equivalents  securities  loans  payables and deposits 
monetary assets and liabilities are those that can be converted into a fixed number of dollars 
the company s consolidated balance sheet reflects a net positive monetary position monetary assets exceed monetary liabilities 
during periods of inflation  the holding of a net positive monetary position will result in an overall decline in the purchasing power of a company 
management believes that replacement costs of equipment  furniture  and leasehold improvements will not materially affect operations 
the rate of inflation does affect certain expenses  such as those for employee compensation  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of the company s services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the company faces market risk to the extent that its net interest income and its fair market value of equity are affected by changes in market interest rates 
the asset liability management discipline as applied at the company seeks to limit the volatility  to the extent possible  of both net interest income and the fair market value of equity that can result from changes in market interest rates 
this is accomplished by limiting the maturities of fixed rate investments  loans  and deposits  matching fixed rate assets and liabilities to the extent possible  and optimizing the mix of fees and net interest income 
however  as discussed below  the company s asset liability position differs significantly from most other bank holding companies with significant positive cumulative gaps shown for each time horizon presented 
this asset sensitive position is caused primarily by the operations of the company  which generates large balances of accounts and drafts payable 
these balances  which are noninterest bearing  contribute to the company s high net interest margin but cause the company to become susceptible to changes in interest rates  with a decreasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods of declining interest rates and an increasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods of rising interest rates 
the company s asset liability management committee alco measures the company s interest rate risk sensitivity on a quarterly basis to monitor and manage the variability of earnings and fair market value of equity in various interest rate environments 
the alco evaluates the company s risk position to determine whether the level of exposure is significant enough to hedge a potential decline in earnings and value or whether the company can safely increase risk to enhance returns 
the alco uses gap reports  twelve month net interest income simulations  and fair market value of equity analyses as its main analytical tools to provide management with insight into the company s exposure to changing interest rates 
a gap report is used by management to review any significant mismatch between the repricing points of the company s rate sensitive assets and liabilities in certain time horizons 
a negative gap indicates that more liabilities reprice in that particular time frame and  if rates rise  these liabilities will reprice faster than the assets 
a positive gap would indicate the opposite 
gap reports can be misleading in that they capture only the repricing timing within the balance sheet  and fail to capture other significant risks such as basis risk and embedded options risk 
basis risk involves the potential for the spread relationship between rates to change under different rate environments and embedded options risk relates to the potential for the alteration of the level and or timing of cash flows given changes in rates 
another measurement tool used by management is net interest income simulation  which forecasts net interest income during the coming twelve months under different interest rate scenarios in order to quantify potential changes in short term accounting income 
management has set policy limits specifying acceptable levels of interest rate risk given multiple simulated rate movements 
these simulations are more informative than gap reports because they are able to capture more of the dynamics within the balance sheet  such as basis risk and embedded options risk 
simulation results illustrate that the company s net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease from an immediate and sustained parallel decrease in interest rates of basis points and increase from a corresponding increase in interest rates 
while net interest income simulations do a good job of capturing interest rate risk to short term earnings  they do not capture risk within the current balance sheet beyond twelve months 
the company uses fair market value of equity analyses to help identify longer term risk that may reside on the current balance sheet 
the fair market value of equity is represented by the present value of all future income streams generated by the current balance sheet 
the company measures the fair market value of equity as the net present value of all asset and liability cash flows discounted at forward rates suggested by the current treasury curve plus appropriate credit spreads 
this representation of the change in the fair market value of equity under different rate scenarios gives insight into the magnitude of risk to future earnings due to rate changes 
management has set policy limits relating to declines in the market value of equity 
the results of these analyses indicate that the company s fair market value of equity would decrease from an immediate and sustained parallel decrease in interest rates of basis points and increase from a corresponding increase in interest rates
