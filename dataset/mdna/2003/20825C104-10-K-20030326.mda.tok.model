from the merger date forward  the operations and results of conocophillips reflect the combined operations of the two companies 
as a condition of the merger  the us federal trade commission ftc required that the company divest specified conoco and phillips assets  the most significant of which were phillips woods cross  utah  refinery and associated motor fuel marketing operations  conoco s commerce city  colorado  refinery and related crude oil pipelines and phillips colorado motor fuel marketing operations 
all assets and operations that are required by the ftc to be divested are included in corporate and other as discontinued operations 
included in the results of discontinued operations in was a million after tax charge for the write down to fair value of the phillips operations to be disposed

by the end of  however  the company anticipates raising funds of billion to billion  of which approximately million had been raised as of december   from the sale of assets  including those assets required by the ftc to be sold 
in december  conocophillips entered into an agreement to sell its woods cross refinery and associated marketing assets  subject to state and federal regulatory approvals 
also in december  the company committed to and initiated a plan to sell a substantial portion of its us company owned retail sites 
while the stability of the company s cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration  the company s operating cash flows remain exposed to the volatility of commodity crude oil and natural gas prices and downstream margins  as well as periodic cash needs to finance tax payments and crude oil  natural gas and petroleum product purchases 
the company s primary funding source for short term working capital needs is a billion commercial paper program  a portion of which may be denominated in euros limited to euro billion  supported by billion in revolving credit facilities 
commercial paper maturities are generally kept within days 
at december   conocophillips had  million of commercial paper outstanding  of which million was denominated in foreign currencies 
effective october   conocophillips entered into two new revolving credit facilities to replace the previously existing billion conoco credit facilities  and also amended and restated a prior phillips revolving credit facility to include conocophillips as a borrower 
the company now has a billion day revolving credit facility expiring on october   and two revolving credit facilities totaling billion expiring in october there were no outstanding borrowings under any of these facilities at december  these credit facilities support the company s billion commercial paper program 
conocophillips norwegian subsidiary has two million revolving credit facilities that expire in june  under which no borrowings were outstanding as of december  in addition to the bank credit facilities  conocophillips sells certain credit card and trade receivables to two qualifying special purpose entities qspes in revolving period securitization arrangements

at december  and  the company had sold accounts receivable of billion and million  respectively 
the receivables sold have been sufficiently isolated from conocophillips to qualify for sales treatment 
all five bank sponsored entities are multi seller conduits with access to the commercial paper market and purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other companies unrelated to conocophillips 
conocophillips has no ownership in any of the bank sponsored entities and has no voting influence over any bank sponsored entity s operating and financial decisions 
as a result  conocophillips does not consolidate any of these entities 
beneficial interests retained by conocophillips in the pool of receivables held by the qspes are subordinate to the beneficial interests issued to the bank sponsored entities and were measured and recorded at fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows estimated using management s best estimates concerning the receivables performance  including credit losses and dilution discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved to arrive at present value 
these assumptions are updated periodically based on actual credit loss experience and market interest rates 
conocophillips also retains servicing responsibility related to the sold receivables 
the fair value of the servicing responsibility approximates adequate compensation for the servicing costs incurred 
conocophillips retained interest in the sold receivables at december  and  was billion and million  respectively 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the qspes are not consolidated by conocophillips 
conocophillips retained interest in sold receivables is reported on the balance sheet in accounts and notes receivable

moody s investor service has assigned a rating of a on conocophillips senior long term debt  and standard and poors and fitch have assigned a rating of a 
conocophillips does not have any ratings triggers on any of its corporate debt that would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of conocophillips debt rating and thereby impacting conocophillips access to liquidity 
in the event that conocophillips credit were to deteriorate to a level that would prohibit conocophillips from accessing the commercial paper market  conocophillips would still be able to access funds under its billion revolving credit facilities 
based on conocophillips year end commercial paper balance of billion  conocophillips had access to billion in borrowing capacity as of december   after repaying all outstanding commercial paper  which provides ample liquidity to cover any needs that its businesses may require to cover daily operations

the trusts exist for the sole purpose of issuing preferred securities to outside investors  and investing the proceeds thereof in an equivalent amount of subordinated debt securities of conocophillips 
the two trusts were established to raise funds for general corporate purposes

the company leases ocean transport vessels  drillships  tank railcars  corporate aircraft  service stations  computers  office buildings  certain refining equipment  and other facilities and equipment 
prior to the acquisition of tosco and the merger  the company had in place leasing arrangements for tankers  corporate aircraft and the construction of various retail marketing outlets 
at december   approximately million had been utilized under those arrangements  which is the total capacity available 
at the time the company acquired tosco  tosco had in place previously arranged leasing arrangements for various retail stations and two office buildings in tempe  arizona 
at december   approximately billion had been utilized under those arrangements  which is the total capacity available 
in addition  at the time of the merger  conoco had in place leasing arrangements for certain refining equipment  two drillships  and various retail marketing outlets 
at december   approximately million had been utilized under those arrangements 
several of the above leasing arrangements are with special purpose entities spes that are third party trusts established by a trustee and funded by financial institutions 
other than those leasing arrangements  conocophillips has no other direct or indirect relationship with the trusts or their investors 
each spe from which conocophillips leases assets is funded by at least percent substantive  unaffiliated third party  residual equity capital investment  which is at risk during the entire term of the lease 
changes in market interest rates do have an impact on the periodic amount of lease payments 
conocophillips has various purchase options to acquire the leased assets from the spes at the end of the lease term  but those purchase options are not required to be exercised by conocophillips under any circumstances 
if conocophillips does not exercise its purchase option on a leased asset  the company does have guaranteed residual values  which are due at the end of the lease terms  but those guaranteed amounts would be reduced by the fair market value of the leased assets returned 
these various leasing arrangements meet all requirements under generally accepted accounting principles to be treated as operating leases 
however  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which will require consolidation in july of certain spes that were created prior to january   and which are still in existence at june  the company is evaluating the new interpretation to determine whether the assets and debt of the leasing arrangements would be consolidated 
see note variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
if the company is required to consolidate all of these entities  the assets of the entities and debt of approximately billion would be required to be included in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the entities would be the debt of the entity less the fair value of the assets at the end of the lease terms 
of the billion debt that would be consolidated  approximately billion is associated with a major portion of the company s owned retail stores that the company has announced it plans to sell 
as a result of the planned divestiture  the company plans to exercise purchase option provisions during and terminate various operating leases involving approximately store sites and two office buildings 
in addition  see note discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for details regarding the provisions for losses and penalties recorded in the fourth quarter  for the planned divestiture 
depending upon the timing of the company s exercise of these purchase options  and the determination of whether or not the lessor entities in these operating leases are variable interest entities requiring consolidation in  some or all of these lessor entities could become consolidated subsidiaries of the company prior to the exercise of the purchase options and termination of the leases

all significant litigation arising from the june   flash fire that occurred in a reactor vessel at the k resin styrene butadiene copolymer sbc plant at the houston chemical complex has now been resolved 
on march   an explosion and fire occurred at the k resin sbc plant due to the overpressurization of an out of service butadiene storage tank 
one employee was killed and several individuals  including employees of both conocophillips and its contractors  were injured 
additionally  individuals who were allegedly in the area of the houston chemical complex at the time of the incident have claimed they suffered various personal injuries due to exposure to the event 
the wrongful death claim and the claims of the most seriously injured workers have been resolved 
currently  there are eight lawsuits pending on behalf of approximately primary plaintiffs 
under the indemnification provisions of subcontracting agreements with zachry and brock maintenance  inc  conocophillips sought indemnification from these subcontractors with respect to claims made by their employees 
although that plant was contributed to cpchem under the contribution agreement  conocophillips retains liability for damages arising out of the incident 
environmental conocophillips and each of its various businesses are subject to the same numerous international  federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production  and refining  marketing and transportation of crude oil and refined products businesses 
the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations include  among others  the o federal clean air act  which governs air emissions  o federal clean water act  which governs discharges to water bodies  o federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  which imposes liability on generators  transporters  and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur  o federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which governs the treatment  storage  and disposal of solid waste  o federal oil pollution act of opa under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located  and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the united states  o federal emergency planning and community right to know act epcra which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments  o federal safe drinking water act which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injections wells  and o us department of the interior regulations  which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in us waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from the lessee s operations and potential liability for pollution damages 
these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and  in the case of discharges to water  establish water quality limits 
they also  in most cases  require permits in association with new or modified operations 
these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process  which can be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency s processing of the application 
many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant 
many states and foreign countries where conocophillips operates also have  or are developing  similar environmental laws and regulations governing the same types of activities 
while similar  in some cases these regulations may impose additional  or more stringent  requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders 
the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards  such as air emission standards  water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations  continue to evolve 
however  environmental laws and regulations are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on conocophillips operations in the united states and in most of the countries in which the company operates 
notable areas of potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations in the united states 
under the clean air act  the epa has promulgated a number of stringent limits on air emissions and established a federally mandated operating permit program 
violations of the clean air act are enforceable with civil and criminal sanctions 
the epa has also promulgated specific rules governing the sulfur content of gasoline  known generically as the tier ii sulfur rules  which become applicable to conocophillips gasoline as early as the company is implementing a compliance strategy for meeting the requirements  including the use of conocophillips proprietary technology known as s zorb 
the company expects to use a combination of technologies to achieve compliance with these rules and has made preliminary estimates of its cost of compliance 
these costs will be included in future budgeting for refinery compliance 
the epa has also promulgated sulfur content rules for highway diesel fuel that become applicable in conocophillips is currently developing and testing an s zorb system for removing sulfur from diesel fuel 
it is anticipated that s zorb will be used as part of conocophillips strategy for complying with these rules 
because the company is still evaluating and developing capital strategies for compliance with the rule  conocophillips cannot provide precise cost estimates at this time  but will do so and report these compliance costs as required by law 
additional areas of potential air related impacts to conocophillips are the proposed revisions to the national ambient air quality standards naaqs and the kyoto protocol 
in july  the epa promulgated more stringent revisions to the naaqs for ozone and particulate matter 
since that time  final adoption of these revisions has been the subject of litigation american trucking association  inc et al 
v 
united states environmental protection agency that eventually reached the us supreme court during fall in february  the us supreme court remanded this matter  in part  to the epa to address the implementation provisions relating to the revised ozone naaqs 
if adopted  the revised naaqs could result in substantial future environmental expenditures for conocophillips 
in  an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement  known as the kyoto protocol  which called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations 
the united states has not ratified the treaty codifying the kyoto protocol but may in the future 
in addition  other countries where conocophillips has interests  or may have interests in the future  have made commitments to the kyoto protocol and are in various stages of formulating applicable regulations 
it is not  however  possible to accurately estimate the costs that could be incurred by conocophillips to comply with such regulations  but such expenditures could be substantial 
conocophillips also is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations 
such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents 
remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present conocophillips owned and or operated petroleum marketing outlets throughout the united states 
federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards 
in addition to other cleanup standards  many states have adopted cleanup criteria for mtbe for both soil and groundwater 
mtbe standards continue to evolve  and future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of mtbe contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial 
rcra requires permitted facilities to undertake an assessment of environmental conditions at the facility 
if conditions warrant  conocophillips may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations 
in contrast to cercla  which is often referred to as superfund  the cost of corrective action activities under the rcra corrective action program typically is borne solely by conocophillips 
over the next decade  conocophillips anticipates that significant ongoing expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required  but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures the company has experienced over the past few years 
longer term  expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly 
conocophillips from time to time receives requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute 
on occasion  conocophillips also has been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties 
these requests  notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by conocophillips but allegedly contain wastes attributable to the company s past operations 
as of december   the company reported it had been notified of potential liability under cercla at sites around the united states 
the company also had been notified of potential liability under comparable state laws at sites around the united states 
at august   the date of the merger  conoco had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at sites around the united states 
at seven of these sites  both conoco and the company had been notified of potential liability 
the resulting total for conocophillips was sites 
at december   conocophillips had resolved three of these sites and received four new notices of potential liability  leaving approximately sites where conocophillips has been notified of potential liability 
for most superfund sites  conocophillips potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to conocophillips versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties is relatively low 
although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites  other potentially responsible parties at sites where conocophillips is a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations  and where they have not  or where potentially responsible parties could not be located  conocophillips share of liability has not increased materially 
many of the sites at which the company is potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned 
prior to actual cleanup  those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions  apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation 
in some instances  conocophillips may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability 
actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval 
there are relatively few sites where conocophillips is a major participant  and neither the cost to conocophillips of remediation at those sites nor such cost at all cercla sites in the aggregate is expected to have a material adverse effect on the competitive or financial condition of conocophillips 
expensed environmental costs were million in and are expected to be approximately million in and million in capitalized environmental costs were million in and are expected to be approximately million and million in and  respectively 
remediation accruals conocophillips accrues for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
these accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted except  if assumed in a purchase business combination  such costs are recorded on a discounted basis 
many of these liabilities result from cercla  rcra and similar state laws that require the company to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where it conducts  or once conducted  operations or at sites where conocophillips generated waste was disposed 
the accrual also includes a number of sites identified by conocophillips that may require environmental remediation  but which are not currently the subject of cercla  rcra or state enforcement activities 
if applicable  undiscounted receivables are accrued for probable insurance or other third party recoveries 
in the future  conocophillips may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra 
considerable uncertainty exists with respect to these costs  and under adverse changes in circumstances  potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of december  remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site  depending on the mix of unique site characteristics  evolving remediation technologies  diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies  and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties 
therefore  it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs 
at december   conocophillips balance sheet included a total environmental accrual of million  compared with million at december   an increase of million  primarily resulting from the merger 
the majority of these expenditures are expected to be incurred within the next years 
notwithstanding any of the foregoing and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses  environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in conocophillips operations and products  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
however  conocophillips currently does not expect any material adverse effect upon its results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
other conocophillips has deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities  alternative minimum tax credits  and loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances have been established for certain foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will  more likely than not  be realized 
uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs 
based on the company s historical taxable income  its expectations for the future  and available tax planning strategies  management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income 
the alternative minimum tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely to reduce the company s regular tax liability 
new accounting standards there are a number of new fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas and interpretations that conocophillips implemented either in december or january  as required sfas no

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity 
for additional information about these  see note new accounting standards in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated herein by reference 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
see note accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for descriptions of the company s major accounting policies 
certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
the acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information  prior to the discovery of proved reserves  is expensed as incurred  similar to accounting for research and development costs 
however  leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet  pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect 
property acquisition costs for individually significant leaseholds  management periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date 
for leasehold acquisition costs that individually are relatively small  management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area 
for prospects in areas that have had limited  or no  previous exploratory drilling  the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high 
this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost  and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense 
this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds  and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively 
by the end of the contractual period of the leasehold  the impairment probability percentage will have been adjusted to percent if the leasehold is expected to be abandoned  or will have been adjusted to zero percent if there is an oil or gas discovery that is under development 
see the supplemental oil and gas operations disclosures about costs incurred and capitalized costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in acquisition activity  and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties 
exploratory costs for exploratory wells  drilling costs are temporarily capitalized  or suspended  on the balance sheet  pending a judgmental determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort 
this judgment usually is made within two months of the completion of the drilling effort  but can take longer  depending on the complexity of the geologic structure 
accounting rules require that this judgment be made at least within one year of well completion 
if a judgment is made that the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities  the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and are reported in exploration expense 
exploratory wells that are judged to have discovered potentially economic quantities of oil and gas and that are in areas where a major capital expenditure eg  a pipeline or offshore platform would be required before production could begin  and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory work in the area  remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as additional exploratory appraisal work is under way or firmly planned 
for complicated offshore exploratory discoveries  it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while the company performs additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field 
unlike leasehold acquisition costs  there is no periodic impairment assessment of suspended exploratory well costs 
management continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges that the potential field does not warrant further exploratory efforts in the near term 
see the supplemental oil and gas operations disclosures about costs incurred and capitalized costs for more information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in exploration activity and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties  as well as the wells in progress disclosure for the number and geographic location of wells not yet declared productive or dry 
proved oil and gas reserves engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  accounting rules require supplemental disclosure of proved oil and gas reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understanding the perceived value and future cash flows of a company s oil and gas operations 
the judgmental estimation of proved oil and gas reserves is also important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit of production calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that field 
there are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as proved 
the company s reservoir engineering department has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines 
the company has qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel who make these estimates 
proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and seismic information about each field 
also  as required by authoritative guidelines  the estimated future date when a field will be permanently shut in for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of oil and gas prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date 
this estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves 
therefore  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
canadian syncrude reserves canadian syncrude proven reserves cannot be measured precisely 
reserve estimates of canadian syncrude are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering assessments of in place crude bitumen volume  the mining plan  historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors  installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits 
the reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting the bitumen and upgrading it into a light sweet crude oil 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  these estimates are used in determining depreciation expense 
impairment of assets long lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group 
if  upon review  the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group  the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value 
individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets generally on a field by field basis for exploration and production assets  at an entire complex level for downstream assets  or at a site level for retail stores 
because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long lived assets  the fair value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group 
the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes  prices and costs  considering all available information at the date of review 
see note impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
dismantlement  removal and environmental costs under various contracts  permits and regulations  the company has material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at production sites 
the largest asset removal obligations facing conocophillips involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world  and oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in alaska 
the estimated undiscounted costs  net of salvage values  of dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued  using primarily the unit of production method  over the productive life of the asset 
estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult 
most of these removal obligations are many years in the future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria will have to be met when the removal event actually occurs 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as well as political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
see note accrued dismantlement  removal and environmental costs in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
business acquisitions purchase price allocation accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business 
for most assets and liabilities  purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value 
the most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties  plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets 
the company uses all available information to make these fair value determinations and  for major business acquisitions  typically engages an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
the company has  if necessary  up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation 
intangible assets and goodwill in connection with the acquisition of tosco corporation on september   and the merger on august   the company recorded material intangible assets for tradenames  air emission permit credits  and permits to operate refineries 
these intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives and so are not amortized 
this judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future 
if  due to changes in facts and circumstances  management determines that these intangible assets then have definite useful lives  amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis 
as long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives  they will be subject to periodic lower of cost or market tests  which requires management s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets 
see note acquisition of tosco corporation  note merger of conoco and phillips  and note impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
also in connection with the acquisition of tosco and the merger  the company recorded a material amount of goodwill 
under the accounting rules for goodwill  this intangible asset is not amortized 
instead  goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two step accounting test 
the first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units within the company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value including the goodwill of the reporting unit 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value  no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required that year 
if  however  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value  then a second step must be performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment to record  if any 
in this second step  the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical new acquisition of the reporting unit 
the various purchase business combination rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit s assets and liabilities 
the residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit  and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount if lower 
because quoted market prices for the company s reporting units are not available  management has to apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of its reporting units for purposes of performing the first step of this periodic goodwill impairment test 
management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance 
in addition  if the first test step is not met  further judgment has to be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase price allocation 
again  management has to use all available information to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance 
at year end  the estimated fair values of the company s domestic refining and marketing reporting units  excluding those acquired in the merger and those included in discontinued operations  were more than percent higher than the recorded net book values including the tosco goodwill of the reporting units 
however  a lower fair value estimate in the future could result in impairment of the remaining billion of tosco goodwill 
the allocation of goodwill attributable to the conocophillips merger to reporting units  and its sensitivity to future impairment  will occur after the final allocation of the purchase price in inventory valuation prior to the acquisition of tosco in september and the merger in august  the company s inventories on the last in  first out lifo cost basis were predominantly reflected on the balance sheet at historical cost layers established many years ago  when price levels were much lower 
therefore  prior to  the company s lifo inventories were relatively insensitive to current price level changes 
however  the acquisition of tosco and the merger added lifo cost layers that were recorded at replacement cost levels prevalent in late september and august  respectively 
as a result  the company s lifo cost inventories are now much more sensitive to lower of cost or market impairment write downs  whenever price levels fall 
conocophillips recorded a lifo inventory lower of cost or market impairment in the fourth quarter of due to a crude oil price deterioration 
while crude oil is not the only product in the company s lifo pools  its market value is a major factor in lower of cost or market calculations 
the company estimates that additional impairments could occur if a percent percent blended average of west texas intermediate brent crude oil prices falls below per barrel at a reporting date 
the determination of replacement cost values for the lower of cost or market test uses objective evidence  but does involve judgment in determining the most appropriate objective evidence to use in the calculations 
projected benefit obligations determination of the projected benefit obligations for the company s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement 
this also impacts the required company contributions into the plans 
the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events  including estimated retirement dates  salary levels at retirement  mortality rates  lump sum election rates  rates of return on plan assets  future health care cost trend rates  and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees 
due to the specialized nature of these calculations  the company engages outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations 
for employee retirement income security act qualified pension plans  the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required company contributions into plan assets 
due to differing objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies  the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects 
ultimately  the company will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns  but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time 
benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions 
a percent decrease in the discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by million  while a percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by million 
outlook as a condition to the merger  the us federal trade commission ftc required that both conoco and phillips divest certain assets 
in the fourth quarter of  the propane terminal assets at jefferson city  missouri  and east st 
louis  illinois  were sold and conocophillips agreed to sell its woods cross business unit in salt lake city  utah  plus associated assets 
see note discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a list of the remaining assets held for sale 
in december  conocophillips committed to and initiated a plan to sell a substantial portion of its company owned retail sites 
in connection with the anticipated sale  the company  in the fourth quarter  recorded charges totaling  million before tax   million after tax  primarily related to the impairment of properties  plants and equipment  goodwill  intangible assets and provision for losses and penalties to unwind various lease arrangements 
the company expects to complete the sale of the sites in in december of  political unrest in venezuela caused economic and other disruptions which shut down most oil production in venezuela  including the company s petrozuata  hamaca and gulf of paria operations 
at conocophillips petrozuata joint venture  operations were closed down on december   due to shortages of hydrogen and natural gas required for processing and fuel 
prior to the disruptions  petrozuata was producing and processing approximately  gross  net barrels of extra heavy crude oil per day 
similarly  the disruptions have impacted development production and construction progress at the hamaca joint venture project 
construction of the hamaca upgrader continues  although at a reduced rate 
difficulty in obtaining supplies has been the primary impediment 
production was shut in on december  prior to the disruptions  hamaca was producing approximately  gross  net barrels of extra heavy crude per day 
in addition  the crude oil produced by petrozuata is used as feedstock for conocophillips lake charles  louisiana  refinery and a venezuelan refinery operated by pdvsa 
in december  conocophillips substituted about million crude barrels for its lake charles refinery 
at the company s sweeny refinery  crude throughputs were reduced slightly due to short supply of merey venezuelan crude oil 
overall  there was minimum impact to net income  however  it could reduce net income million to million per month in as long as production at petrozuata and hamaca is shut in 
limited production began from hamaca and petrozuata in february on march   conocophillips announced that it had signed a heads of agreement lng hoa with the tokyo electric power company  incorporated tepco and tokyo gas co  ltd 
tokyo gas that would enable phase ii  which involves the export and sale of natural gas  of the bayu undan field development to proceed upon resolution of certain legal  regulatory and fiscal issues 
the timor sea treaty treaty was ratified by timor leste formerly east timor in december and by australia in march and is subject to certain procedural events before it is fully effective 
the treaty will allow the issuance of new production sharing contracts to the existing contractors in the bayu undan unit  which when combined with the expected approval of the development plan and the expected enactment of certain timor leste legislation will provide the legal  regulatory and fiscal basis necessary to proceed with the gas project 
under the terms of the lng hoa with tepco and tokyo gas  tepco and tokyo gas will purchase million tons per year of liquefied natural gas lng for a period of years  utilizing natural gas from the bayu undan field 
shipments would begin in  from an lng facility near darwin  australia  utilizing conocophillips optimized cascade liquefied natural gas process 
in  conocophillips expects worldwide production of approximately million barrels of oil equivalent per day from currently proved reserves 
improvements for the year are expected to come from the united kingdom  norway and china 
these improvements will be offset by decreases in the us lower and canada as a result of the disposition of assets  as well as the impact of the disruptions in venezuela 
in r m  crude oil throughputs in are expected to average approximately million barrels per day 
crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control  such as global economic conditions  political events  demand growth  inventory levels  weather  competing fuels prices and availability of supply 
crude oil prices increased significantly during due to production restraint by major exporting countries serving to rebalance inventories  supply concerns resulting from middle east tensions  tropical storms in the us gulf of mexico temporarily shutting in oil production and shipping  and the disruptions in venezuela 
global oil demand is starting to recover on a year over year basis  compared with the declines that resulted from the us recession and the events of september  however  the pace of improvement will depend on a continuation of the economic recovery in the united states and globally 
conflicts in oil producing countries and uncertainties surrounding the global economic recovery could keep prices volatile in us natural gas prices strengthened considerably at the end of the third quarter and remained strong in the fourth quarter stemming from growing natural gas supply concerns  rising oil prices and an increased demand due to the weather 
supply concerns arose from the decline in domestic gas production and canadian imports versus  and tropical storms temporarily shutting in production in the gulf of mexico 
refining margins are subject to movements in the price of crude oil and other feedstocks  and the prices of petroleum products  which are subject to market factors over which the company has no control  such as the us and global economies  government regulations  seasonal factors that affect demand  such as the summer driving months  and the levels of refining output and product inventories 
global refining margins remained depressed during much of due to weak oil demand  relatively high levels of gasoline and distillate inventories and strengthening crude prices  which increased feedstock costs 
as a result of tropical storms in the gulf of mexico  industry refining crude oil runs were temporarily reduced  which caused product inventory draws in the united states and improved refining margins modestly 
refining and marketing margins can be expected to improve when the us and global economies recover

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instrument market risk conocophillips and certain of its subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments that expose cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices  foreign exchange rates or interest rates 
the company may use financial and commodity based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of electric power  natural gas  and crude oil and related products  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  or to exploit market opportunities 
with the completion of the merger on august   the derivatives policy adopted during the third quarter of is no longer in effect  however  the conocophillips board of directors has approved an authority limitations document that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the chief executive officer 
the authority limitations document also authorizes the chief executive officer to establish the maximum value at risk var limits for the company 
compliance with these limits is monitored daily 
the function of the risk management steering committee  monitoring the use and effectiveness of derivatives  was assumed by the chief financial officer for risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  and by the executive vice president of commercial  a new position that reports to the chief executive officer  for commodity price risk 
conocophillips commercial group manages commercial marketing  optimizes the commodity flows and positions of the company  monitors related risks of the company s upstream and downstream businesses  and selectively takes price risk to add value 
commodity price risk conocophillips operates in the worldwide crude oil  refined product  natural gas  natural gas liquids  and electric power markets and is exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities 
these fluctuations can affect the company s revenues as well as the cost of operating  investing  and financing activities 
generally  the company s policy is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities  however  executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of the company s equity crude oil and natural gas production  as well as refinery margins 
the conocophillips commercial group uses futures  forwards  swaps  and options in various markets to optimize the value of the company s supply chain  which may move the company s risk profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives o balance physical systems 
in addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration  exchange traded futures contracts may also be settled by physical delivery of the commodity  providing another source of supply to meet the company s refinery requirements or marketing demand  o meet customer needs 
consistent with the company s policy to generally remain exposed to market prices  the company uses swap contracts to convert fixed price sales contracts  which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers  to a floating market price  o manage the risk to the company s cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil  natural gas  refined product and electric power transactions  and o enable the company to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to the company s physical business 
for the months ended december  and  the gains or losses from this activity were not material to the company s cash flows or income from continuing operations 
conocophillips uses a var model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued  including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet at december   as derivative instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
using monte carlo simulation  a percent confidence level and a one day holding period  the var for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at december  and  was million at each year end 
the var for instruments held for purposes other than trading at december  and  was million and million  respectively 
interest rate risk the following tables provide information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the debt tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates  the derivative table shows the notional quantities on which the cash flows will be calculated by swap termination date 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
the carrying amount of the company s floating rate debt approximates its fair value 
the fair value of the fixed rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices 
millions of dollars except as indicated mandatorily redeemable other minority interests and debt preferred securities expected fixed average floating average fixed average maturity rate interest rate interest rate interest date maturity rate maturity rate maturity rate year end remaining years  total   fair value   year end remaining years  total   fair value   interest rate derivatives at december  floating to fixed expected maturity date notional average pay rate average receive rate remaining years total fair value loss position foreign currency risk conocophillips has foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from operations in over countries around the world 
conocophillips does not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes  although the company may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk 
examples include firm commitments for capital projects  certain local currency tax payments and dividends  and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year 
at december   conocophillips had the following significant foreign currency derivative contracts o approximately million in foreign currency swaps hedging the company s european commercial paper program  with a fair value of million  o approximately million in foreign currency swaps hedging short term intercompany loans between uk subsidiaries and a uk subsidiary  with a fair value of million  and o approximately million in foreign currency swaps hedging the company s firm purchase and sales commitments for gasoline in germany  with a negative fair value of million 
although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates  the company elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by sfas no 
as a result  the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings 
assuming an adverse hypothetical percent change in the december   exchange rates  the potential foreign currency remeasurement loss in non cash pretax earning from these swaps  intercompany loans  and commercial paper would be approximately million 
in addition to the intercompany loans discussed above  at december  and  us subsidiaries held long term sterling denominated intercompany receivables totaling million and million  respectively  due from a uk subsidiary 
the uk subsidiary also held a dollar denominated long term receivable due from a us subsidiary with no balance at december   and a million balance at december  a norwegian subsidiary held million and million of intercompany us dollar denominated receivables due from its us parent at december  and  respectively 
also at year end  a foreign subsidiary with the us dollar as its functional currency owed a million norwegian kroner denominated payable to a norwegian subsidiary 
the potential foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses in non cash pretax earnings from a hypothetical percent change in the year end and exchange rates from these intercompany balances were million and million  respectively
