in constant dollar terms  canadian sales increased  european direct sales increased and net international sales  excluding canadian sales and european direct sales  increased in compared to the same period in gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in compared to for the comparable period in this increase was primarily the result of favorable sourcing costs for our products and effective inventory management 
in addition  favorable weather conditions in the northeastern us allowed for the timely shipping of full priced fall products and improved margins on off price selling activities 
these increases were partially offset by the effect of the weaker euro us dollar and canadian dollar us dollar currency hedge rates in compared to the same period in selling  general and administrative expense selling  general  and administrative expense sg a increased to million in from million for the comparable period in  primarily as a result of an increase in variable selling and operating expenses to support the higher level of sales

table of contents interest income expense  net interest income was million in compared to million for the comparable period in and interest expense was million in compared to million for the comparable period in these changes were attributable to an increase in cash compared to the same period in and repayments of short term notes payable 
income tax expense the provision for income taxes increased to million in from million in the effective tax rate was for and for the reduction in the effective tax rate was due to several factors including the relative mix of international and domestic profitability and  to a lesser degree  the utilization of foreign tax credits

in constant dollar terms  canadian sales increased  european direct sales increased and net international sales  excluding canadian sales and european direct sales  increased in compared to the same period in gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in compared to for the comparable period in this increase was due to the following factors including higher margins on spring outerwear and reduction of close out product shipments for the three months ended march  when compared to the same period in  reduced impact of currency fluctuation  timely receipt of goods from factories  and minimal off priced selling for three months ended september  when compared to same period in  and strong margins on outerwear closeout activity during the three months ended december  these increases were tempered by an increase in sales of spring close out products which produce lower margins and negative effects of the euro currency during the six months ended june  selling  general and administrative expense selling  general  and administrative expense increased to million in from million for the comparable period in  primarily as a result of an increase in variable selling and operating expenses to support the higher level of sales 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expense decreased to in from for the comparable period in this change was primarily due to strong sales growth in  coupled with continued operating efficiencies from global infrastructure investments and maintenance of prudent cost control measures given the current economic environment 
interest income expense  net interest income was million in compared to million for the comparable period in and interest expense was million in compared to million for the comparable period in these changes were attributable to our increased cash position during the first  
table of contents second and fourth quarters of as compared to the same periods in combined with our decreased borrowings and an overall reduction in the short term rates in when compared to income tax expense the provision for income taxes increased to million in from million in the effective tax rate was for and for the lower tax rate in was due primarily to the utilization of foreign tax credits which were not replicated in liquidity and capital resources we financed our operations for the year ended december  primarily through cash provided by operating activities 
at december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income  decreases in accounts receivable and inventories and an increase in accounts payable 
our primary capital requirements are for working capital and general corporate needs 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million for the comparable period in in  our major capital expenditures consisted of approximately million for the construction of our european distribution facility in cambrai  france and approximately million for other north american distribution related projects as well as maintenance capital requirements 
in our major capital expenditures consisted of the expansion and retrofit of our united states distribution center  the development of our new corporate headquarters and the construction of our european distribution facility 
cash used in financing activities was million in as compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the comparable period in in  net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to repayment of borrowings on short term notes payable of million and net repayment of million on long term debt offset by proceeds from the sale of stock under employee stock plans of million 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of stock under employee stock plans of million  net borrowings of short term notes payable of million  and net borrowings of million of long term debt 
to fund our domestic working capital requirements  we have available unsecured revolving lines of credit with aggregate seasonal limits ranging from million to million  of which million to million is committed 
as of december   no domestic balance was outstanding under these lines of credit 
internationally  our subsidiaries have local currency operating lines in place guaranteed by us with a combined limit of approximately million at december  the balance outstanding under these lines of credit was million as of december  additionally  we maintain unsecured and uncommitted lines of credit with a combined limit of million at december   available for issuing letters of credit 
at december   the balance outstanding under these letters of credit was million 
as we continue our investment in global infrastructure to support our growth  we anticipate the capital expenditures for will be approximately million  consisting of maintenance capital requirements and information technology and distribution projects 
we expect to fund these costs with existing cash and cash provided by operations 
if the need for additional expenditures arises  we may need to seek additional funding 
our ability to obtain additional credit facilities will depend on many factors  including prevailing market conditions  our financial condition  and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
we do not assure you that financing will be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
our operations are affected by seasonal trends typical in the outdoor apparel industry  which have historically resulted in higher sales and profits in the third calendar quarter 
this pattern has resulted primarily 
table of contents from the timing of shipments to wholesale customers for the fall outerwear season 
as our sportswear and footwear product lines mature  we expect an increasing impact on seasonal shipments and corresponding working capital requirements 
we believe that our liquidity requirements for at least the next months will be adequately covered by existing cash  cash provided by operations and existing short term borrowing arrangements 
the following table presents our estimated contractual commitments in thousands year ending december  thereafter debt repayments operating leases non related parties related parties these operating lease commitments are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as a result of our international sales  production and funding requirements 
our policy is to utilize financial instruments to reduce market risk where internal netting and other strategies cannot be effectively employed 
foreign currency and interest rate transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect cash flows resulting from sales  purchases and other costs from exchange rate movements 
we manage this risk by using forward exchange contracts and purchased options to hedge certain firm as well as anticipated commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party or intercompany transactions 
anticipated  but not yet firmly committed  transactions that we hedge carry a high level of certainty and are expected to be recognized within one year 
we use cross currency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated payments related to intercompany loan agreements 
hedged transactions are denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen and canadian dollars 
the fair value of our hedges was unfavorable by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a change in the euro  japanese yen and canadian dollar exchange rates would have resulted in the fair value fluctuating approximately million at december  and million at december  changes in fair value  resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  would be substantially offset by the change in value of the underlying hedged transactions 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes on our million and million of long term debt as of december  and  respectively 
we do  however  have cash flow exposure on our committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit because interest is based on libor and other interest rate indices 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  cost of sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved 
table of contents in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
we base our ongoing estimates on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
some of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policy for revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  and inventory obsolescence 
revenue recognition we record wholesale and licensed product revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title generally passes upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some countries outside of the us  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical and expected delivery times by geographic location 
upon shipment  we also provide for estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims 
however  actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates for the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and we make judgments about the credit worthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
we analyze specific customer accounts  customer concentrations  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance may be required 
if we determine a smaller or larger allowance was appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expense in the period in which we made the determination 
inventory obsolescence and product warranty we make ongoing estimates of potential future excess  close out or slow moving inventory and product warranty costs 
we identify our excess inventory  a component of which is planned  and evaluate our purchase commitments  sales forecasts  and historical experience and make provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value 
when evaluating our reserve for warranty costs  we consider our historical returns rates by season  product mix  current economic trends  and the historical cost to repair  replace  or refund the original sale 
in the event we determine smaller or larger reserves were appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to cost of sales in the period we made the determination 
income taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we make ongoing estimates in determining the valuation allowance 
table of contents for the net deferred tax asset in order to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
although we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if we have different judgments or use different estimates in the future  these differences may affect the valuation allowance and accordingly  income in the period we made the determination 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated effective rate 
as the calendar year progresses  we periodically refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this ongoing estimation process can result in changes to our expected effective tax rate for the full calendar year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual effective tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and sets forth methods to periodically evaluate these assets for impairment 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and therefore ceased amortization of certain intangible assets 
other than the cessation of amortization  the adoption of this statement had no impact on our results of operations or cash flows for the year ended december  amortization expense for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives was  for and  for during the fourth quarter of  we completed an impairment test on the intangible assets and determined that these assets were not impaired 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under previous guidance  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of this statement will be applied prospectively  as applicable  and are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we have chosen to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb and related interpretations 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ended after december  accordingly  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in the financial reports for the year ended december  as the adoption of this statement involves disclosures only  we do not expect a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under specified guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of fin see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the recognition of a guarantor s obligation should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after december  we do not believe that the provisions of fin will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interest in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interest that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we do not believe that the provisions of fin will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
forward looking statements this annual report  including item of part i and items and a of part ii  contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include any statements related to our expectations regarding future performance or conditions  including any statements regarding potential growth in domestic and international markets  growth in merchandise categories  increased sales to department stores and footwear specialty shops  implementation and performance of new management information systems and distribution facilities  access to raw materials and factory capacity  and financing and working capital requirements and resources 
these forward looking statements  and others made from time to time by management  are subject to many risks and uncertainties 
many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements  including the risks described below under the heading factors that may affect our business and the price of our common stock 
risk factors that may affect liquidity  future financing and working capital requirements and availability include business disruptions and costs arising from acts of terrorism or military activities around the globe  unfavorable economic conditions generally and weakness in consumer confidence  the financial health of our customers  our ability to effectively deliver products to customers in a timely manner due to potential service interruptions  effects of unseasonable weather for example  warm weather in the winter and cold weather in the spring that affects demand for our products  our reliance on product acceptance by consumers  dependence on independent manufacturers and suppliers  effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts  intense competition in the industry which we expect to increase  our ability to achieve and manage growth effectively  
table of contents international risks  including trade disruptions  political instability in foreign markets  exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in quotas and tariffs or other duties  effective implementation and expansion of our distribution facilities  and our ability to establish and protect our intellectual property 
we do not undertake any duty to update forward looking statements after the date they are made  to conform them to actual results or to changes in circumstances or expectations 
factors that may affect our business and the price of our common stock our business is affected by weather conditions our business is adversely affected by unseasonal weather conditions 
sales of our outerwear are dependent in part on the weather and may decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of our outerwear or cold weather footwear 
for example  we believe unseasonably warm weather in the united states in and caused customers to delay  and in some cases reduce or cancel  orders for our outerwear  which had an adverse effect on our net sales and profitability 
similarly  unseasonably warm weather in made it more difficult for retailers to sell outerwear and we believe resulted in retailer caution when placing orders for fall periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter or unseasonably cold or wet weather in the spring could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our sales and earnings may be adversely affected by an economic downturn or economic uncertainty sales of our products  particularly outerwear  are subject to substantial cyclical fluctuation 
consumer demand for our apparel and footwear  or our licensed products  may not reach our growth targets  or may decline  when there is an economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets  particularly markets in north america and europe 
continuing weakness in the japanese economy  for example  has limited growth opportunities in recent years  and a slowing economy in the united states in has created additional uncertainties as to our customers and our business 
in addition  recent volatility in the global oil markets has resulted in rising fuel prices  which many shipping companies are passing on to their customers 
our shipping costs have increased over the past several months  and we expect these costs may continue to increase 
we may not be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers 
our sensitivity to economic cyclicality and any related fluctuation in consumer demand and rising shipping costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our international operations involve many risks we are subject to many risks generally associated with doing business abroad  including foreign governmental regulations  foreign consumer preferences  political unrest  disruptions or delays in shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products 
terrorist acts and us military operations abroad appear to have increased the risks of doing business abroad  and we expect this to continue with the increased prospect of military action in the middle east 
these factors  among others  could influence our ability to sell products in international markets  our ability to manufacture products or procure materials  as well as our cost of doing business 
if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  many of our imports are subject to duties  tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states or into our other sales markets 
the countries in which our products are produced or sold may adjust or impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we produce a significant portion of our products in china  and therefore adverse conditions in china or adverse changes in china s trading status with the us or with other sales markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we are affected by the financial health of retailers we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer s financial circumstances  generally without requiring collateral 
to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products  we offer customers discounts for placing pre season orders and extended payment terms for taking delivery before the peak shipping season 
these extended payment terms increase our exposure to the risk of uncollectible receivables 
in addition  we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty 
some of our significant customers have experienced financial difficulties in the past  which in turn have had an adverse effect on our business  and we believe retailers are being more cautious than usual with orders as a result of weakness in the retail economy 
a slowing economy in our key markets could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in very competitive markets the markets for outerwear  sportswear and rugged footwear are highly competitive  as are the markets for our licensees products 
in each of our geographic markets  we face significant competition from global and regional branded apparel and footwear companies 
in many instances  retailers who are our customers pose our most significant competitive threat by marketing apparel and footwear under their own labels 
we also compete with other apparel and footwear companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our apparel and for import quota capacity 
many of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources and have achieved greater recognition for their products than we have 
increased competition could result in reductions in display areas in retail locations  reductions in sales or reductions in prices of our products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we face risks associated with consumer preferences and fashion trends we believe we have benefited from changing consumer preferences  including increased consumer interest in outdoor activities and lifestyle changes that emphasize apparel designed for these activities 
changes in consumer preferences or consumer interest in outdoor activities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  although we believe our products have not been significantly affected by past fashion trends  changes in fashion trends could have a greater impact as we expand our offerings to include more product categories in more geographic areas also  we face risks because our business requires us to anticipate consumer preferences 
our decisions about product designs often are made far in advance of consumer acceptance 
although we try to manage our inventory risk through early order commitments by retailers  we must generally place production orders with manufacturers before we have received all of a season s orders 
if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to consumer preferences  we could experience lower sales  excess inventories and lower profit margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends on our use of proprietary rights our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to our ability to create and sustain demand for our products 
we also place significant value on our trade dress  the overall appearance and image of our products 
from time to time  we discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or design knock offs 
if we are unsuccessful in challenging a party s products on the basis of trademark or design infringement  continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products 
the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks and other proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 
additionally  in markets outside of the united states  it may be more difficult for us to establish our proprietary rights and to challenge successfully use of those rights by other parties 
although we have not been materially 
table of contents inhibited from selling products in connection with trademark and trade dress disputes  as we extend our brand into new product categories  new product lines and expand the geographic scope of our marketing  we could become subject to litigation based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties 
future litigation also may be necessary to defend us against such claims or to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights 
any intellectual property litigation could be costly and could cause diversion of management s attention from the operation of our business 
adverse determinations in any litigation could result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses from third parties  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends on our distribution facilities and systems our ability to meet customer expectations  manage inventory  complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our existing distribution facilities  the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities 
in the united states  we rely primarily on our distribution center in portland  oregon  in canada  we rely primarily on our distribution center in strathoy  ontario  and in europe we distribute our products through two different distribution centers one in the netherlands that is owned and operated by an independent logistics company  and the other in cambrai  france  which we own and operate 
we expect that this new facility in cambrai  france will replace the remaining distribution center in the netherlands in the implementation and performance of the new distribution facility is subject to many risks generally associated with transition and startup activities  including the risk that the new distribution facility may not successfully handle distribution activities 
our distribution facilities in the united states  the netherlands  and france are highly automated  which means their operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to computer viruses  the proper operation of software and hardware  electronic or power interruptions  or other system failures 
our operations could also be interrupted by disasters  such as earthquakes which are known to occur in the northwestern united states or fires 
we maintain business interruption insurance  but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effect that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 
we may not be able to implement our growth strategy or manage growth successfully we face many challenges in implementing our growth strategies 
for example  our expansion into international markets involves countries where we have little sales or distribution experience and where our brand is not yet widely known 
expanding our product categories involves  among other things  gaining experience with new products  gaining consumer acceptance  and establishing and protecting intellectual property rights 
increasing sales to department stores  and improving the sales productivity of our customers  will each depend on various factors  including strength of our brand name  competitive conditions  our ability to manage increased sales and future expansion  the availability of desirable locations and the negotiation of terms with retailers 
future terms with customers may be less favorable to us than those we now operate under 
large retailers in particular increasingly seek to transfer various costs of business to their vendors  such as the cost of lost profits from product price markdowns 
to implement our business strategy  we need to manage growth effectively 
we need to continue to change various aspects of our business  to maintain and enhance our information systems and operations to respond to increased demand and to attract  retain and manage qualified personnel 
growth could place an increasing strain on management  financial  product design  marketing  distribution and other resources  and we could experience operating difficulties 
for example  in recent years  we have undertaken a number of new initiatives that require significant management attention and corporate resources  including the development or expansion of distribution facilities on two continents and the acquisition  rejuvenation and extension of the sorel brand 
this growth involves many risks and uncertainties and  if we are unable to manage it effectively  we may not achieve our objectives our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our business we generally purchase products in us dollars 
however  the cost of these products sourced overseas may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies 
price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations could make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins 
our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies  and these revenues and expenses could be materially affected by currency fluctuations  including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 
we conduct a program to hedge against our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we may not  however  be successful and foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
labor disruptions at ports may adversely affect our business our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner 
as a result  we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide  particularly in the western united states 
labor disputes at certain ports  such as those experienced at western us ports in  create significant risks for our business  particularly if such disputes result in work slowdowns  lockouts  strikes  or other disruptions during our peak importing seasons  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers  unanticipated inventory accumulation  and reduced revenues and earnings 
we depend on independent manufacturers to make our products and meet customer expectations our products are produced by independent manufacturers worldwide 
we do not operate or own any production facilities 
although we enter into a number of purchase order commitments each season  we do not have long term contracts with certain manufacturers 
we therefore face risks that manufacturing operations will fail to perform as expected  or that our competitors will gain production or quota capacities that we need for our business 
if a manufacturer fails to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet our standards  we could miss delivery requirements  which could result in cancellation of orders  refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in purchase prices  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in an effort to ensure that our independent manufacturers operate with safe  ethical and humane working conditions  we regularly monitor factories and we enforce our requirements that each agree to comply with our standards of manufacturing practices and applicable laws and regulations  but we do not control these vendors or their labor practices 
if a manufacturer violates labor or other laws  or engages in practices that are not generally accepted as ethical in our key markets  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on key suppliers for some specialty fabrics some of the materials that we use may be available  in the short term  from only one source or a very limited number of sources 
for example  some specialty fabrics are manufactured to our specification by one source or a few sources 
from time to time  we have experienced difficulty satisfying our raw material and finished goods requirements 
although we believe we could identify and qualify additional factories to produce these materials  the unavailability of some existing manufacturers for supply of these materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our advance purchases of products may result in excess inventories to minimize our purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non delivery  we place orders for our products with manufacturers prior to receiving all of our customers orders and maintain an inventory of various products that we anticipate will be in greater demand 
we may not be able to sell the 
table of contents products we have ordered from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory 
customers may be allowed to cancel an order prior to shipment with sufficient advance notice 
inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on key personnel our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel  particularly timothy boyle  our president and chief executive officer  and gert boyle  our chairman and widely recognized advertising spokesperson 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain key managers  designers  sales people and others 
we face intense competition for such individuals worldwide  and there is a significant concentration of well funded apparel and footwear competitors in and around portland  oregon including nike and adidas 
we may not be able to attract or retain these employees  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our business is affected by seasonality and fluctuations in operating results our results of operations have fluctuated and are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
our products are marketed on a seasonal basis  with a product mix now weighted substantially toward the fall season 
our results of operations for the quarter ended september in the past have been much stronger than the results for the other quarters
