item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations our total revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to a increase in our billing and transaction processing service business  partially offset by a decline in roaming service revenues and to a lesser extent  a decline in prepaid systems revenue 
in  total revenues declined compared to  primarily due to a decline in roaming service revenues and an decline in revenues from our billing and transaction processing service business  partially offset by a increase in prepaid systems revenue 
our operating income of million for the year ended december  represents an increase from an operating loss of  for the year ended december  and operating income of million for the year ended december  the increase in billing and transaction processing service revenues and our corresponding fixed infrastructure principally contributed to the increase in operating income in compared to the decline in billing and transaction processing service revenues  the decline in roaming service revenues and additional expenses related to freedom wireless contributed to the operating loss in  compared to the specifics of each segment s revenues and gross margin are discussed in greater detail below 
our reportable operating segments consist of billing and transaction processing services  roaming services and prepaid systems 
the accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note of our consolidated financial statements  except that the financial results for our operating segments have been prepared using a management approach 
this approach is consistent with the basis and manner in which our management internally analyzes financial information for the purposes of assisting in making internal operating decisions 
we evaluate performance based on the gross margin of each stand alone business 
segment disclosure information is included in note of our consolidated financial statements 
our chief operating decision maker is our president and chief executive officer 
our operating segments are managed separately because each represents a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves unique markets within the wireless industry 
however  the businesses complement each other by providing us with a strong suite of products and services to meet the needs of wireless carriers 
we believe that any impact from inflation is not material 
segment data billing and transaction processing services roaming services prepaid systems total in thousands except for percentages revenues gross margin gross margin percentage revenues gross margin gross margin percentage revenues gross margin gross margin percentage the gross margin for the prepaid systems business includes  of inventory write downs in december  billing and transaction processing services billing and transaction processing services revenues increased to million in from million in and decreased in from million in billing and transaction processing revenues increased in due primarily to the increase in average billed minutes of use per subscriber per month to for the fourth quarter of from for the fourth quarter of december  the higher billed minutes of use resulted primarily from an increase in the number of digital subscribers on our network and increased average usage as our carrier customers promoted more competitively priced and full featured prepaid offerings 
in addition  the increase in our subscriber base to million at december  from million at december  contributed to the revenue increase 
the increase in the subscriber base resulted from the additional subscriber growth of our existing carrier customers who competitively promoted and priced their offerings  subscriber conversions from cingular wireless markets that were previously served by competitors platforms and  to a lesser extent  subscribers from new carrier customers added to the service in the fourth quarter 
these increases were offset by a decrease in our average billed rate per minute as carriers availed themselves of our volume pricing discounts 
the decrease in revenues during resulted from a reduction in subscribers principally from the losses of rogers at t and at t wireless as customers 
the decrease was partially offset by subscriber growth from our existing customers 
our subscriber base totaled million at december  in  we expect that our billing and transaction processing revenues will increase compared to as we expand our prepaid wireless services subscriber base 
we expect that the average billed minutes of use per subscriber per month will increase as our carrier customers aggressively market their prepaid offerings and as our new carrier customers  who launched in the latter part of  build their subscriber bases 
we expect that the anticipated revenue growth will be tempered  however  as carriers who generate higher minutes of use avail themselves of contracted volume pricing discounts 
gross margins for billing and transaction processing services increased to of billing and transaction processing services revenues in from of such revenues in gross margins for billing and transaction processing services decreased in compared to in the improvement in gross margin from to resulted from the significant increase in billing and transaction processing service revenues that leveraged our predominantly fixed cost infrastructure 
the decrease in gross margins from to was primarily due to lower revenues 
we expect that gross margins will show modest increases for  compared to as revenues grow and we leverage our predominantly fixed infrastructure which will be partially offset by our investment in our payment services business and gross margins for voyager that are lower than prepaid services 
roaming services roaming services revenues decreased to million in from million in and decreased in from million in the decrease in roaming services revenues was primarily attributable to consolidation in the industry and advancements in handset technology that have improved registered roaming capabilities and therefore decreased the need for this service 
we anticipate that these trends will continue  and therefore  roaming services revenues are expected to continue to decrease about in compared to the prior year 
gross margins for roaming services decreased to of roaming services revenues in from of such revenues in and decreased in from in the decreases in and resulted primarily from lower revenues and the resulting lower absorption of fixed costs 
prepaid systems prepaid systems revenues decreased to million in from million in and increased in from million in prepaid systems revenues decreased in due to a slight decrease in sales of prepaid systems to international customers 
sales in increased compared to as we sold more international systems and experienced a corresponding increase in maintenance revenue 
gross margins for prepaid systems increased to of prepaid systems revenues in from of such revenues in and decreased in from of such revenues in the increase in gross margins in primarily resulted from an increase in expansion sales to existing customers  which typically yield higher margins 
the decrease in principally resulted from the special charge of  recorded in the fourth quarter of for accruals  inventory write offs and severance resulting from the discontinuance of our voice mail product 
in  prepaid systems gross margins are expected to decrease slightly  as we expect a greater percentage of our system sales to be made to new customers that typically yield lower margins 
we currently price and sell all of our systems to international customers in us dollars 
all payments are received in us dollars  which minimizes our need to hedge against foreign currency risk 
operating data total of revenue total of revenue total of revenue in thousands total revenues engineering  research and development expense sales and marketing expense general and administrative expense general and administrative expense legal depreciation and amortization expense impairment of long lived assets engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development expenses primarily include the salaries and benefits for software development and engineering personnel associated with the development  implementation and maintenance of existing and new services 
engineering  research and development expenses were of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in the increases in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in resulted from additional resources devoted to expanding and enhancing the features and functionality of our billing and transaction processing services business 
the increase as a percentage of revenue in compared to was a result of lower revenues without a corresponding reduction in research and development investment 
engineering  research and development expenses are expected to increase in since we will incur a full year of expenses from our october  infotech acquisition and we intend to continue to increase expenditures to support ongoing and future development and enhancements of our prepaid and other wireless services and systems 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include direct sales and product management salaries  commissions  travel and entertainment expenses  in addition to the cost of trade shows  direct mail and other promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses declined to of total revenues in from of total revenues in this decrease resulted from consistency in our staffing and sales strategy and approach as well as our success in effectively managing costs 
sales and marketing expenses remained consistent at in and while decreasing in absolute dollars in compared to due to reductions in travel costs and other promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in absolute dollars in due to the full year of expenses from our infotech acquisition and to support our increased investment in the payment services business in addition to our overall growth 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of employees and other expenses that provide our administrative support 
total general and administrative expenses remained consistent at of total revenues for the years ended december   and the decrease in absolute dollars from to was a result of less headcount and lower bonuses earned in general and administrative expenses are expected to decrease as a percentage of revenues in as we continue to leverage our overhead as our revenues increase 
general and administrative expenses legal charges general and administrative legal expenses consist of special charges of million in  million in and million in primarily for legal expenses to defend the patent infringement suit initiated by freedom wireless 
these legal expenses are expected to cost up to million per quarter until the freedom wireless matter is resolved 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of telecommunications systems  building  furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
we provide for depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to twenty years 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to of total revenues for from of total revenues in and remained consistent at of total revenues in the increase from to primarily resulted from additional equipment and software purchased and developed to support our growth 
the decrease in absolute dollars in compared to was due to fewer capital additions needed as our revenues decreased and to many assets becoming fully depreciated in late and we expect that depreciation and amortization will increase in for the following reasons more capital deployed to support the anticipated growth and continued enhancements in billing and transaction processing services  a full year of amortization of the intangible assets from the infotech acquisition and additional depreciation related to the purchase of our bedford  massachusetts facility 
impairment of long lived assets we recognized pre tax charges of  in and million in the charge for was related to the write down of hardware and software no longer used in our prepaid systems business as a result of the discontinuance of our voice mail system product 
the charge for was related to the write down of equipment no longer being used to support our billing and transaction processing services business  as such assets were not expected to generate any additional cash flows 
interest income  net interest income decreased to million in compared to million in and increased in from million in interest income was earned primarily from investments which were purchased using the cash generated from operations  the sale of our teleservices business in and the proceeds from our public offerings 
the decrease in interest income in was due to lower interest rates in the marketplace 
the increased cash generated from operations and the sale of our teleservices business yielded additional interest income in that was partially offset by lower interest rates in and a million decrease in our cash and short term investments balance compared to although we expect to continue to generate cash from operations in  our purchase of the building and the lower interest rates compared to are expected to result in a decrease in interest income in other expense a non recurring charge of  for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the permanent impairment of a cost based investment 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate for the years ended december  and was  which approximates the statutory rate 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was principally due to the reversal of valuation allowance resulting from our utilization of net operating losses in our income tax rate is expected to decrease slightly to about in primarily due to a lower overall state income tax rate 
income from discontinued operations our teleservices business  consisting primarily of customer service call center operations  was sold to teletech holdings  inc on november  for million including the assumption of certain liabilities 
the sale was reported as a discontinued operation in the gain on disposal of the teleservices business was million  net of income taxes of million 
acquisition in october  the company completed the acquisition of infotech solutions corporation isc  a privately held provider of billing software solutions for the wireless marketplace  providing the company with an outsourced billing product to provide postpaid and prepaid billing services for wireless carriers 
the company paid million in cash to acquire substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of isc 
additional contingent cash consideration of up to million may be paid to isc  based on attaining certain defined annual revenue targets from through any contingent consideration payments will be accounted for as additional goodwill 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill 
the fair values were determined based on fair values as of the date of acquisition 
identifiable intangible assets are comprised of acquired technology and customer contracts and are being amortized over five years 
the results of operations of isc are included in the company s consolidated statement of income from the date of acquisition 
selected quarterly operating results the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results of our operations for the eight quarters in the two year period ended december   including such amounts expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
this quarterly information is unaudited  prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and  in the opinion of our management  reflects all necessary adjustments  consisting of normal recurring accruals  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented

the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  capitalized software and labor  legal expenses  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies to be our most critical policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and allowance for bad debts our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component affecting our operations 
in addition  revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and bonuses 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments relating to the elements required for revenue recognition affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue  changes in judgments concerning recognition of revenue  change in mix  amount of international sales or delay recognizing revenue could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we recognize our revenues in conformity with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we earn billing and transaction processing services revenues in various ways depending on the type of transaction 
for bcgi prepaid wireless services  we earn revenues principally by processing prepaid wireless minutes  net of any penalties incurred related to outages on the platform 
for bcgi payment services  we earn revenues by processing transactions on behalf of carrier s subscribers and for bcgi voyager billing and customer care  we earn revenues by generating a subscriber s monthly bill 
we earn roaming services revenues by processing wireless calls for unregistered wireless subscribers who have roamed outside of their service area 
roaming services revenues are recorded net of amounts that are estimated to be disputed by unregistered wireless subscribers  based on historical experience 
we believe that our estimates fairly represent the anticipated amounts to be disputed 
each of these revenues is recognized when the service is provided 
for license fees  special projects and implementation services  revenues are recognized ratably over the remaining life of the contract with the carrier 
for multiple element arrangements  we determine the fair value of each element based on our vendor specific objective evidence for that element and allocate total revenue from these arrangements to each element based on its fair value 
for our prepaid systems business  we recognize revenue from the sale of systems at the time the systems are shipped or delivered to the customer  depending on shipping terms 
in the event there are acceptance terms  we defer revenue until acceptance has occurred 
installation revenue is deferred until the entire installation is complete 
revenues from maintenance and support services are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support contract period based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based upon the amount charged when purchased separately  which is typically the contract s renewal rate 
in addition to recording revenues net of any penalties incurred related to outages on the platform and estimated amounts to be disputed  we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet our financial obligations eg bankruptcy filings  substantial downgrading of credit scores  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
in addition  we recognize reserves based on the length of time the receivables are past due and on historical experience 
if circumstances change eg higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet our financial obligations  we estimate the recoverability of amounts that could be adversely affected 
we believe that our allowance for bad debt fairly represents the potential amount of bad debt that we will incur 
legal costs we accrue the costs of settlements  damages and  under certain conditions  costs of defense when such costs are probable and estimable  otherwise  such costs are expensed as incurred 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in we began expensing legal costs related to the freedom wireless lawsuit as incurred due to the lengthy and unpredictable discovery process  which has now made it difficult to reasonably estimate legal costs in the suit 
other litigation will continue to be accounted for in accordance with our accounting policy and the related estimate has been developed in consultation with our outside counsel who is handling the case 
we believe that we have recorded an appropriate estimate of anticipated legal expenses  but there can be no assurances that our expenses will not exceed our estimate 
research and development  software development costs and costs capitalized for internal use research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
however  costs incurred for the development of computer software or deployment of assets for internal use are capitalized 
the direct labor and payroll related costs of development of computer software are capitalized primarily for coding and testing of software in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the direct labor  travel and payroll related costs to deploy assets for internal use are capitalized until the asset is placed in service 
we have financial controls in place  which include reviews by management and finance personnel of time reports submitted by employees to ensure that costs capitalized are appropriate 
we make judgments regarding the specific time that can be capitalized based upon the type of project and type of work being performed 
the capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on management s judgment which contemplates the anticipated future undiscounted net cash flows and changes in hardware and software technologies 
amortization of capitalized software development costs begin when the product is made available for general release and amortization of internal use costs begins when the related asset is first placed in service 
these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over a three year period 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles  and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which result in an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when indicators of impairment exist and the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets  other than goodwill  may not be recoverable  we compare the projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets  which is determined considering a number of factors including past operating results  budgets  economic projections  market trends and product development cycles  to their carrying value 
if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted cash flows  the asset is considered impaired and the carrying value is then compared to the asset s fair value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded immediately in the statement of operations 
fair value is determined by either a quoted market price or use of a present value technique  which requires judgments to be made by management regarding estimating future cash flows  economic life and discount rates  among other assumptions 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
for impairment tests of goodwill  management has determined that our goodwill is attributed to our billing and transaction processing services and prepaid systems businesses as a single unit 
as a result  we utilize the enterprise wide approach  which is based on the market value of our common stock  to determine the fair value of our reporting segments and compare that to our consolidated book value to determine if an impairment loss exists 
in october  we acquired infotech solutions corporation and determined the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the principal asset acquired was completed technology of million related to billing software solutions for the wireless marketplace as well as customer contracts of  the fair value of these assets was determined by management  based in part upon information supplied by the management of the acquired business and a valuation analysis prepared by an independent appraiser 
the valuation of completed technology has been primarily based on future cash flow projections over the estimated economic life adjusted for an incremental obsolescence rate discounted to present value 
we estimated that the useful life of the acquired technology is five years 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the fair market value of assets acquired and their useful lives 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement supercedes eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and establishes when a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity must be recognized  which is at the time the liability is incurred 
severance pay  in many cases  would be recognized over time rather than up front 
if the benefit arrangement requires employees to render future service beyond a minimum retention period a liability should be recognized as employees render service over the future service period even if the benefit formula used to calculate an employee s termination benefit is based on length of service 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas 
fas amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  to provide alternative methods of transition to fas s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation in the event companies adopt fas and account for stock options under the fair value method 
fas also amends the disclosure provisions of fas and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting apb  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
while the statement does not amend sfas to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of fas are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of fas or the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
as of december   we have adopted the disclosure requirements of fas as disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financials statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  which requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value as opposed to the current practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
fin also requires a guarantor to make significant new guaranty disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote 
the interpretation s initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for interim or annual periods ending after december  we are not aware of any guarantees that require disclosure as of december  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  fin applies to public enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim or annual period 
we do not expect that the adoption of fin will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to the acquisition of infotech solutions corporation and other factors described below 
net cash provided by operations of million in resulted from million in net income from continuing operations along with adjustments for depreciation and amortization of million and general and administrative legal expense charges of million 
in addition  our increase in accounts receivable of million  resulting from our revenue increase  decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  net of legal charges  and increases in deferred revenue of million from licensing fees that are recognized as revenue over the remaining contract terms  contributed to the cash flows for our investing activities utilized million of net cash in we purchased capital equipment and software of million in for telecommunications systems equipment and software to expand our voice resource network and transaction processing platform 
we also purchased million in short term investments  net of sales 
we anticipate that over the next months we will make capital investments of approximately million to support the acquisition of our new building  purchased in february for approximately million  as well as additional equipment and enhanced feature capabilities to continue to support our growth and strengthen our billing transaction and processing services 
also  we may pay additional contingent cash consideration of up to million to infotech solutions corporation beginning in through  based on attaining certain defined annual revenue targets from through we intend to finance such investments or contingent consideration payments from cash flow generated from operations or short term investments 
our financing activities provided cash of  in  including proceeds of million from the exercise of options and issuance of our common stock  net of  in capital lease repayments 
we also repurchased  treasury shares at a cost of million 
we believe that our short term investments and the funds we anticipate to generate from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next months 
we have purchase obligations and non cancelable operating lease commitments for office space and equipment  many of which are renewable at our option 
future payments due under purchase obligations and non cancelable operating leases are as follows for the years ending december  in thousands operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations and beyond total payments due off balance sheet arrangements during  we did not engage in material off balance sheet activities  including the use of structured finance or special purpose entities  material trading activities in non exchange traded commodity contracts  or material transactions with persons or entities that benefit from their non independent relationship with us 
certain factors that may affect future results the loss or significant reduction of business from one of our major customers  including verizon wireless or cingular wireless  would have a material adverse effect on our business 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues in any particular period has been attributable to a limited number of customers in the wireless telecommunications business 
this concentration of customers intensified in compared to the prior year due to the increased minutes of use of some of our largest customers and carrier consolidation 
specifically  verizon wireless represented and cingular wireless represented of our consolidated revenues in the twelve months ended december  our dependence on verizon and cingular is expected to continue at similar levels in  until our new carrier customers and expanded programs generate more revenue 
our verizon wireless prepaid wireless services contract and certain other contracts expire in and beyond 
while we expect to renew these contracts  when and if each of the contracts is renewed  some contractual rates per minute may be lower than in previous years 
a decline in subscriber levels and minutes of use could adversely affect revenue and gross margins 
these contracts are not exclusive and therefore do not prevent our customers from using competitors billing and transaction processing platforms 
a loss of business from any of our major customers  including non renewal of contracts or a decrease in business due to factors outside our control  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an unfavorable judgment in the freedom wireless lawsuit or any other lawsuit would have a material impact on our business 
in march  freedom wireless filed a suit against us and a number of wireless carriers claiming that we and the other defendants infringe a patent of freedom wireless 
in march  freedom wireless amended the complaint to include a continuation patent 
freedom wireless seeks injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount 
in addition  we are contractually obligated to indemnify the other defendants for any damages that they incur as a result of this dispute 
the suit is currently in the discovery phase  and we cannot yet assess our potential liability 
our failure to prevail in this matter would have any or all of the following significant adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations injunctive relief against us  which could significantly restrict our ability to conduct our business  an adverse judgment against us for significant monetary damages  a settlement on unfavorable terms  obligations to the other defendants to indemnify them for damages  obligations to customers for breach of a contractual warranty of noninfringement  or a requirement to reengineer our prepaid processing methodology to avoid patent infringement  which would likely result in additional expense and delay 
in addition  regardless of the outcome  we will continue to incur significant expenses to defend this lawsuit 
we have spent more than million to date to defend this lawsuit  and we expect to incur up to an additional million per quarter in legal fees until this matter is resolved 
moreover  this lawsuit may divert the efforts and attention of our management team from normal business operations 
finally  we may become subject to additional patent infringement lawsuits in the future 
our business would be materially adversely impacted if we cannot protect our intellectual property 
our success and ability to compete depends in part upon our proprietary technology and our ability to protect such technology 
we have a number of patent applications pending to protect our proprietary technology in the united states and internationally 
if these patent applications are not approved  we may not be able to prevent others from using similar technologies and we may be subject to additional patent infringement lawsuits or royalty payments to use the technology 
we rely on a combination of contractual provisions  confidentiality procedures  and patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
these legal protections afford only limited protection and competitors may gain access to our intellectual property which may result in the loss of customers 
in addition  despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our technology or to obtain and use our proprietary information 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources with no assurance of success and could seriously harm our business and operating results 
if our wireless carrier customers do not successfully market and sell our services  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we depend on our wireless carrier customers to market and sell our services to their consumers and we can provide no assurance that they will do so successfully 
our contracts with our major customers are not exclusive 
therefore  these carriers can and have utilized their own prepaid services or prepaid services of our competitors in addition to ours 
therefore  we can give no assurance that there will be a significant market for prepaid programs  including our prepaid wireless services offerings 
if we experience outages in our network  we will be subject to financial penalties that could adversely affect our business and operating results 
our operations depend on our ability to maintain our computer  switching and other telecommunications equipment and systems in effective working order and to protect our systems against damage from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  computer viruses or similar events 
although we have built redundancy into our network providing for backup systems  equipment and telecommunications connections in such events  there are still parts of the network that are not redundant at this time 
the building at which our redundant site in waltham  massachusetts is hosted is being shut down in march therefore  we have moved all of our processing back to our woburn  massachusetts facility 
although the woburn facility is designed for redundancy  until our new building in bedford  massachusetts becomes operational expected to be around june  we will not have geographical redundancy 
when the bedford site is operating  we still may not be protected from a natural disaster within the greater boston  massachusetts area 
each quarter  we have experienced network outages  some of which have resulted in significant reductions in revenue due to penalty clauses contained in certain of our carrier customer contracts 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully support and enhance our voice resource network and transaction processing platform effectively or that our voice resource network and transaction processing platform will successfully support current and future growth 
any failure to successfully support current and future growth  or an increase in the frequency or duration of outages would reduce our revenue and damage our reputation 
we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our business  which would adversely impact our ability to offer competitive services and grow 
we have expanded our operations rapidly  creating significant demands on our management  administrative  operational  development and financial personnel and other resources 
any additional expansion by us may further strain our management  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that our systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of our operations 
inability of our management to manage operational changes effectively  would materially and adversely affect the quality of our services  our ability to retain key personnel and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not continue to develop and offer more functionality and features in our services at competitive prices  we will not be able to compete effectively and our business will be materially and adversely affected 
our business will not be successful if we do not develop and offer more functionality and features in our services than those available in competitive offerings 
in addition  we may be unable to leverage our existing infrastructure to provide these services cost effectively 
if we cannot develop and provide more functionality and features than our competitors  or if we are unable to keep our costs down to do so  we would likely lose market share or be required to reduce our margins  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if we do not continue to upgrade our software and hosting environment as new wireless technologies evolve  including but not limited to g and g technologies  we may lose existing and prospective customers 
the market for our services is very competitive and is dependent on the growth and health of the wireless industry and wireless carriers 
we have historically provided our services almost exclusively to wireless carriers 
the market for services to wireless carriers is highly competitive and subject to rapid change as new technologies are continually introduced in the wireless marketplace 
we anticipate continued growth and competition in the wireless services industry and  consequently  the entrance of new competitors in the future 
our competitors include independent providers of prepaid and other services to wireless carriers and the wireless carriers themselves who provide  or can provide  in house similar services to ours 
these wireless carriers  and many of the independent service providers  have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do 
competitive pressures may make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers and may require us to reduce the price of our service offerings 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
our failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position would limit our ability to retain and increase our market share  resulting in serious harm to our business and operating results 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate  which may result in significant fluctuations in our stock price 
we have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and such fluctuations may continue and could intensify 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including variations in volumes of minutes of use generated by our carrier customers subscribers  the rates per minute paid by our customers  our carrier s ability to acquire additional prepaid subscribers  our ability to minimize the percentage of total prepaid subscribers that terminate service on our network  decreased demand for our prepaid systems  caused by reductions in capital budgets of our customers and other reasons beyond our control  the timing of the introduction or acceptance of new services offered by us or our competitors  changes in the mix of services we provide  seasonal trends  particularly in the second and third quarters when carriers are not usually marketing and selling prepaid services as aggressively as in the first and fourth quarters of the year  and the number and significance of network outages in a particular quarter and the severity and timing of penalties that result from such outages 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarter our results of operations will be below prior results or the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
if we cannot successfully integrate infotech into our business  the acquisition may be dilutive to our earnings and may impede our ability to compete effectively 
our future success depends in part on our ability to offer a compelling suite of products services for wireless carriers  including our voyager billing and customer care solution that we purchased from infotech 
we must therefore successfully integrate infotech into our business 
the success of the infotech acquisition depends on our ability to successfully integrate and manage the acquired technology  retain the necessary key employees of infotech  develop  integrate and market services and service enhancements based on the technology we acquired  and control costs and expenses as well as demands on our management associated with the acquistion 
there can be no assurances that we will integrate infotech in a cost effective manner or at all  or that we can effectively integrate  market and sell infotech s suite of solutions with our technology 
as a result  we may not achieve anticipated revenues  profits or other benefits from this acquisition 
in addition  any problems or delays we experience in integrating infotech may divert resources and management s attention from other parts of our business 
finally  there can be no assurances that the infotech acquisition will not be dilutive to our earnings 
the decline in our roaming services business continues and we must continue to reduce costs to keep this business profitable 
we expect that demand for roaming services will continue to decline as consolidation in the wireless industry reduces the number of unregistered roamers and as handset technology continues to improve registered roaming capabilities 
although we have successfully reduced costs to support roaming services and maintained gross profits  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in continuing to do so 
if we fail to reduce costs at a greater rate than the decline in roaming services revenue going forward or if our roaming services business fails to generate profits for us  our overall margins and results of operations will be adversely affected 
we depend on a number of third party software  hardware and service vendors to provide our services and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if we are unable or delayed in our ability to obtain these components and applications 
our operations are supported by many hardware components and software applications from third party vendors  sometimes licensed from single vendors 
there can be no assurance that these vendors will continue to license these components and applications to us or that they will do so at reasonable prices 
in addition  there can be no assurance that these hardware components and software applications will function in accordance with specifications agreed upon by us and our vendors 
if we cannot obtain these components and applications from our existing vendors  we may not be able to timely procure or develop replacement software and hardware at commercially reasonable costs  or at all 
if we are unable to do so  we may be required to delay the development or sale of our current or future services  which would materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  worldcom  inc  who currently provides certain telecommunications services to us  has filed for chapter bankruptcy 
although we have backup and redundancy plans in place  if there are any significant decreases in service levels  or if worldcom is no longer able to provide certain services to us  our business would suffer during the transition period to a replacement carrier 
changes in international economic conditions could harm our prepaid systems business 
we currently price and sell all of our systems to international customers in us dollars 
in addition  many prepaid systems customers are multinational corporations 
we currently receive payments in us dollars in order to protect us from foreign currency fluctuations 
however  in the future  prepaid systems sales to foreign countries may result in losses due to devaluation of foreign currencies or other international business conditions beyond our control 
the loss of any key personnel could harm our prepaid systems business 
we depend on a limited number of personnel to sell prepaid systems 
failure to retain such personnel would impair our ability to effectively market and sell prepaid systems for at least several months while we properly train new personnel 
any delay in sales and marketing efforts due to such turnover  or failure of existing personnel to perform at an adequate level would materially and adversely affect the prepaid systems business 
changes in government regulations can adversely impact our business 
proposals to intensify or reduce government regulations of the wireless telephone industry continue to be discussed at both the federal and state levels 
such changes may decrease the growth of the wireless telephone industry  result in new competitors or industry consolidation  limit the number of potential customers for our services or impede our ability to offer competitive services to the wireless market or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
while our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase  however  a change in interest rates would not have a material impact to the fair values of our investments because our investments are typically held to maturity  are generally conservative in nature and are of relatively short duration 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for either hedging foreign currency exposure risk or speculative trading purposes 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
