item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
with the exception of the company s revolving credit facility  long term debt obligations are at fixed interest rates and denominated in us dollars 
the company manages its interest rate risk by monitoring trends in interest rates as a basis for determining whether to enter into fixed rate or variable rate agreements
