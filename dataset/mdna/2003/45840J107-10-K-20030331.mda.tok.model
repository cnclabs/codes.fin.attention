market trends in  the core institutional services market has experienced a higher than normal level of cancellations primarily attributable to cost cutting across financial institutions 
however  revenues from the ft interactive data business remained relatively resilient in the current uncertain market conditions due primarily to new business generated in the final quarter of and new customer contracts entered into in  which more than offset the level of cancellations noted above 
the company believes that this is because much of the data supplied by the company is mission critical to its customers and needed for their operations regardless of market conditions

the company has established relationships with  and is a major data supplier to  many service bureaus and custodian banks  and expects to benefit from their growth 
another trend in north america is the consolidation of financial institutions 
when institutions merge  they look to gain synergies by combining their operations  thereby removing the need for two data sources  which accounts for some of the higher than normal cancellations mentioned previously 
growth in the institutional market is dependent on the company s ability to continue to expand its data content offerings to meet the needs of its clients

if impairment is indicated due to the book value being in excess of the fair value  the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
the company typically utilizes the services of a third party business valuation firm to assist in this process 
in assessing the potential impairment of the retail reporting unit  consideration was given to the planned expansion of the real time service in the retail reporting unit to more institutional clients 
given the decline in

no information regarding forward looking statements from time to time  including in this annual report on form k and in the company s annual report to shareholders  the company may issue forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  strategy  plans  critical accounting policies  technological developments  new products  research and development activities and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the company notes that a variety of factors  including known and unknown risks and uncertainties as well as incorrect assumptions  could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
some of the factors that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of the company s business include the following the company competes against companies with greater financial resources 
the company operates in highly competitive markets in which it competes with other distributors of financial and business information and related services 
the company expects competition to continue to be rigorous 
some of the company s competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company does 
these competitors may be able to expand product offerings and data content more effectively and to respond more rapidly than the company to new or emerging technologies  changes in the industry or changes in customer needs 
they may also be in a position to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
increased competition in the future could limit the company s ability to maintain or increase its market share or maintain its margins  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or operating results 
a prolonged outage at one of the company s data centers could have a material adverse impact on revenues 
the company s customers rely on the company for time sensitive  reliable and up to date data 
the company s business is dependent on its ability to rapidly and efficiently process substantial quantities of data and transactions on its computer based networks and systems 
the company s computer operations and those of its suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist attacks  wars and other events beyond the company s control 
the company maintains back up facilities for each of its major data centers to seek to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations 
in addition  the company maintains insurance for such events  however  the business interruption insurance the company carries may not be sufficient to compensate the company fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such events 
any such losses or damages incurred by the company 
table of contents could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
although the company seeks to minimize these risks as far as commercially reasonable through controls and back up data centers  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful in all cases 
the inability to maintain relationships with key suppliers and providers of market data or service bureaus and custodian banks could result in a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
the company currently depends on key suppliers for the data it provides to its customers 
some of this data is exclusive to such suppliers and cannot be obtained from other suppliers 
in other cases  although the data may be available from secondary sources  the secondary source may not be as adequate or reliable as the primary or preferred source 
further  there can be no assurance that the company could obtain replacement data from an alternative supplier without undue cost and expense  if at all 
the company generally obtains data via license agreements 
the disruption of any relationship or the termination of any license with a major data supplier  such as the new york stock exchange  could materially disrupt the company s operations and lead to a material adverse impact on results of operations 
part of the company s strategy is to serve as a major data supplier to service bureaus and custodian banks and thereby to benefit from the trend of major financial institutions in north america outsourcing their back office operations to such entities 
if this trend shifts or any of these relationships falter the company s results of operations could be adversely impacted 
a decline in activity levels in the securities markets could lower demand for the company s services 
the company s business is dependent upon the health of the financial markets and the participants in those markets 
financial information market demand is somewhat dependent upon activity levels in the securities markets 
in the event that the us or international financial markets suffer a prolonged downturn that results in a significant decline in investor activity  the company s revenue levels could be adversely affected 
consolidation of financial services within and across industries could lower demand for the company s products and services 
as consolidation occurs and synergies are achieved  the number of potential customers for the company s products and services decreases 
this consolidation has two forms consolidations within an industry such as banking and across industries such as consolidations of insurance  banking and brokerage companies 
when two companies that separately use the company s products and services combine  they may terminate the use of some of the company s products and services that become duplicative 
the company has experienced higher than normal cancellations as a result of such trend in recent years and can give no assurance that such consolidation and cancellations will not continue 
a large number of cancellations or lower utilization resulting from consolidations could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues 
new or enhanced product offerings by competitors or technologies could cause the company s services to become obsolete 
the company operates in an industry that is characterized by rapid and significant technological changes  frequent new products  services  data content and coverage enhancements and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introductions of new products  services and data content and coverage enhancements  the company s products and services will likely become technologically obsolete or inadequate over time  in which case the company s revenue and operating results would suffer 
the company expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and services  to enhance data content and coverage and to introduce new products  services and technologies 
these competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies  changes in the industry and changes in customers requirements than we can 
if the company fails to anticipate customers needs and technological trends accurately  the company will be unable to introduce new products and services into the market to successfully compete 
if the company is unsuccessful at developing and introducing new products and services that are appealing to customers with acceptable prices and terms and available timely  the company s business and operating results would be negatively impacted because the company would not be able to compete effectively and its ability to generate revenues would suffer 
in addition  new products  services  data content and coverage that the company may develop and introduce may not achieve market acceptance 
failure to successfully integrate the comstock business and any other business or product line the company acquires could adversely affect the company s future results of operations 
the success of any acquisition depends in part on the company s ability to integrate the acquired company 
the process of 
table of contents integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of management s attention and financial and other resources 
in particular  the integration of the operations of comstock could present a significant challenge to the company s management 
the integration process is continuing and will proceed for at least eighteen months 
the company can give no assurance that it will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business  in general  and comstock  in particular 
nor can the company give assurance that it will be able to maintain or improve the historical financial performance of comstock or other acquisitions 
the failure to successfully integrate cultures  operating systems  procedures and information technologies could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
pearson has the ability to control the company 
pearson owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
accordingly  pearson has the ability to exert significant influence over the management and affairs of the company  including the ability to elect all of the directors and to approve or disapprove any corporate actions submitted to a vote of the company s stockholders 
the inability of the company to broaden its retail subscriber base by adding more individual investors outside of the company s traditional active trader market could result in lower revenues 
the customers of the company s retail investor segment have traditionally been active traders 
as the stock markets have been flat or continue to decline this has led to a significant downturn in trading activity and the number of active traders has decreased 
if the company cannot successfully sell additional retail products and services to individual investors to counteract the decrease in trading activities and the number of potential active trader customers  the company could experience a material decrease in revenues 
the foregoing discussion of risks  uncertainties  and assumptions is by no means complete but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact the company s results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of the company s business is conducted outside the united states through its foreign subsidiaries and branches 
the company has foreign currency exposure related to its operations in international markets where it transacts business in foreign currencies and  accordingly  the company is subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  changes in currency exchange rates may impact the translation of foreign statements of operations into us dollars  which may in turn affect the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company s primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks rest with the uk sterling to us dollar exchange rate due to the significant size of the company s operations in the united kingdom 
the company does not enter into any hedging or derivative arrangements and the company does not hold any market risk sensitive instruments for investment or other purposes 
the company currently invests excess cash balances in money market accounts 
these accounts are largely invested in us government obligations and investment grade commercial paper  accordingly  the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonable near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows will not be material
