overview founded in  we are a provider of data conversion and digital mapping services to users of customized geographic information systems 
we experience yearly and quarterly fluctuations in production costs  salaries  wages and related benefits and subcontractor costs 
these costs may vary as a percentage of sales from period to period 
we utilize infotech enterprises ltd  an india based company  for a significant percentage of our offshore production services 
backlog increases when new contracts are signed and decreases as revenues are recognized 
changes in macroeconomic and industry market conditions were first encountered in fiscal and have continued through fiscal these changes have resulted in a reduction of timely order flow 
at september   backlog was million as compared with million at september  we believe these adverse market conditions were and continue to be primarily caused by the recessionary economic climate  consolidation in the utility industry  our adverse financial results for fiscal years   and and increased competition from companies with offshore operations 
a number of the projects awarded to us are greater than million or longer than two years in duration  which can increase risk due to inflation  as well as changes in customer expectations and funding availability 
our contracts are generally terminable on short notice  and while we rarely experience such termination  there is no assurance that we will receive all of the revenue anticipated under signed contracts 
see item business risk factors and risks associated with terms of customer contracts 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting on a cost to cost basis 
for each contract  an estimate of total production costs is determined and these 
table of contents estimates are reevaluated monthly 
the cost estimation process requires substantial judgements 
the duration of the contracts and the technical challenges included in certain contracts affect the company s ability to estimate costs precisely 
production costs consist of internal costs  primarily salaries and wages  and external costs  primarily subcontractor costs 
internal and external production costs may vary considerably among projects and during the course of completion of each project 
at each accounting period  the percentage of completion is based on production costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated production costs for each of our contracts 
this percentage is then multiplied by the contract s total value to calculate the sales revenue to be recognized 
the percentage of completion is affected by any factors which influence either the estimate of future productivity or the production cost per hour used to determine future costs 
we recognize losses on contracts in the period such loss is determined 
sales and marketing expenses associated with obtaining contracts are expensed as incurred 
valuation of accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management routinely assesses the financial condition of our customers and the markets in which these customers participate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
litigation 
we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings that arise from the ordinary course of business 
liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgment based on professional knowledge and experience of management and our legal counsel 
when estimates of our exposure for claims or pending or threatened litigation matters meet the criteria of sfas  amounts are recorded as charges to net earnings 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
income taxes 
the year was the only year out of the last three in which we have reported net income and taxable income  and we reported a net loss in fiscal the current and prior year losses generated a sizeable federal tax net operating loss  or nol  carryforward of approximately million as of september  generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this nol if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize it to offset future taxes 
due to the size of the nol carryforward in relation to our recent history of unprofitable operations and to the continuing uncertainties surrounding our future operations as discussed above  we have not recognized any of this net deferred tax asset 
we currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes primarily state taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax for current income 
it is possible  however  that we could be profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the nol carryforward 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which would approximate under current tax rates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nol is utilized

revenues decreased or million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decline in the number and size of customer contracts 
salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits include employee compensation for production  marketing  selling  administrative and executive employees

subcontractor costs includes production costs incurred through the use of third parties for production tasks such as data conversion services to meet contract requirements  aerial photography and ground and airborne survey services 
subcontractor costs decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was due to a decreased number of contracts  completing backlog that utilized subcontractor labor and the sale of the colorado office 
subcontractor costs increased as a percentage of revenues to for fiscal from for fiscal principally as a result of our use of domestic subcontractors in fiscal as compared to offshore subcontractors in fiscal other general and administrative costs 
other general and administrative costs includes rent  maintenance  travel  supplies  utilities  insurance and professional services 
such costs decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in travel  supplies and certain professional services expenses  which varied with the general decrease in personnel in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  other general and administrative costs increased slightly to for fiscal from for fiscal

we incurred severance expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal these costs represented and of revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
other expense  net 
other expense  net  is comprised primarily of interest expense  which increased to  for fiscal from  in fiscal year this increase is due to the recognition of accretion and discount on our preferred stock as interest expense during the fourth quarter of as required by fas no 
 offset by a decrease in interest paid on bank debt as a result of the extinguishment of bank debt in the first six months of fiscal most of the interest expense in fiscal is non cash in nature as it relates to accretion of discount or payment is deferred 
gain on extinguishment of debt  net of tax 
we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of debt of million in fiscal such gain is a result of the debt forgiveness related to a million cash payment  the issuance of a  unsecured promissory note and the issuance of non convertible preferred stock with an original fair value of  to fully retire debt of million 
this gain reflects net tax of due to our estimated effective tax rate for the year 
income tax benefit 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal as a result of a recent change in federal tax regulations 
we recorded zero tax expense for fiscal and also  as a result of the uncertainty that sufficient future taxable income can be recognized to realize additional deferred tax assets  no additional income tax benefit has been recognized for fiscal and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we elected early adoption of fasb statement no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  as of october  we determined that goodwill had been impaired under the provisions of fasb and we recognized a loss of million as the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle during fiscal net earnings loss

fiscal years ended september  and revenues 
we recognize revenues as services are performed 
revenues recorded in a period are reported net of adjustments to reflect changes in estimated profitability of each project 
revenues decreased or million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decline in the number and size of customer contracts and the sale of the colorado office and by downward adjustments in the anticipated profitability of existing contracts 
as required by percentage of completion accounting guidelines  the revenue impact of these changes in accounting estimates is recorded in the current period 
salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits include employee compensation for production  marketing  selling  administrative and executive employees

such costs decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in travel  supplies and certain professional services expenses  which varied with the general decrease in personnel in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  other general and administrative costs increased to for fiscal from for fiscal bad debts 
we record losses  or the anticipation of losses  arising from our investment in accounts receivable and revenues in excess of billings in the period in which the possibility of loss is identified 
bad debts were  in fiscal versus million in fiscal bad debt expense in fiscal related primarily to the write down of a receivable on a terminated contract 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization in fiscal consists primarily of amortization of goodwill incurred in connection with our acquisitions  as well as depreciation of certain of our operating assets 
for fiscal  goodwill amortization was discontinued due to the change in accounting principle to apply the provisions of sfas see discussion on the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle below 
for fiscal  depreciation decreased million to  from million for fiscal due to equipment becoming fully depreciated  the sale of the colorado office  and the consolidation from four production centers to two 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization was for fiscal and for fiscal severance and related costs 
we incurred severance expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal these costs represented of revenues in both fiscal and fiscal gain on sale of assets 
on april   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our colorado springs  colorado based land mapping office for an aggregate sales price of approximately million  including cash proceeds of million and the assumption of million of certain liabilities by the buyer 
we transferred approximately million of net working capital and million of net book value of equipment and leasehold improvements to the buyer and recorded a gain on sale of approximately million after transaction and other expenses

interest expense decreased  for fiscal from million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to reduced average debt outstanding and lower interest rates in fiscal most of the interest expense in fiscal is non cash in nature as it relates to accretion of discount or payment is deferred 
income tax expense benefit 
we recorded income tax benefit of million in fiscal as a result of a recent change in federal tax regulations 
new regulations allowed us to claim a refund of taxes paid in prior years by increasing the carryback period of our federal net operating loss generated in fiscal year from two years to five years 
we continued to project zero tax expense for fiscal  excluding the 
table of contents benefit from this change in tax law 
also  as a result of the uncertainty that sufficient future taxable income can be recognized to realize additional deferred tax assets  no additional income tax benefit has been recognized for fiscal in fiscal  tax expense of million was recognized to reflect the uncertainty that sufficient taxable income could be recognized to realize the deferred tax asset 
gain on extinguishment of debt  net of tax

this gain reflects net tax of due to our estimated effective tax rate for the year 
the gain of  in fiscal represents the debt forgiveness related to a  debt payment under our debt agreement in effect at september  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we elected early adoption of fasb statement no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  as of october  we determined that goodwill had been impaired under the provisions of fasb and recognized a loss of million as the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle during fiscal net earnings loss 
net earnings of million in fiscal is a million improvement over the million net loss in fiscal as discussed above  non operational items accounted for the variance 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal source of liquidity has consisted of cash flow from operations supplemented by secured lines of credit and other borrowings 
we did not have a working capital line of credit as of september  other borrowings consist of a million senior secured convertible debenture and redeemable preferred stock 
on march   we made our final bank debt payment  paying in full a  unsecured promissory note that matured on march  the million senior secured convertible note  which has a face value of million maturing april   bears interest at an annual rate of five percent  but interest is not payable until maturity 
the senior secured convertible note must be converted at maturity to common stock as described below 
the senior secured convertible note is convertible at any time into common stock at a price equal to the lesser of i  ii of the average closing bid prices of the common stock for the trading days ending the trading date immediately preceding the closing date of april  calculated to be  and iii of the average closing bid prices for the trading days having the lowest closing bid price during the trading days immediately prior to the conversion date  but under any event  the number of shares issuable upon full conversion of the note must constitute at least of the issued and outstanding shares  on a fully diluted basis  as of the date of full conversion 
if at the time of conversion of the note  the price of the common stock has dropped below per share  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the note and upon exercise of the warrants would increase 
similarly  if asi issues shares of common stock at a price of less than per share  the conversion price and the exercise price decrease to that lower price  and the number of shares issuable under the note and the warrants would therefore increase 
at the time of conversion  any unpaid interest is to be paid in shares of common stock 
if the note had been converted in full on september   the conversion price would have been  and we would have issued  shares to redeem the principal and accrued interest 
the note is subject to mandatory conversion in three years and is secured by all of our assets 
all amounts and prices have been adjusted to reflect the one for ten reverse split of common stock that became effective october  
table of contents the holder of the senior secured convertible note  tonga partners  lp  also received warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock subject to adjustment 
one whole warrant entitles tonga to acquire an additional share of common stock at an exercise price equal to of the conversion price of the note 
assuming an exercise price of per share of  the aggregate exercise price for the warrants would be  for the issuance of  shares of common stock  but the shares issuable upon conversion of the note and exercise of warrants are to be no less than of the outstanding common stock unless tonga exercises the warrants in a cashless exercise where tonga uses the value of some of the warrants to pay the exercise price for other warrants 
on november   we issued  shares of our common stock pursuant to the partial conversion of the senior secured convertible debenture 
the shares were issued at a price of for an aggregate conversion of  of principle payable and  of interest payable 
the million debenture was exchanged for the shares and a million debenture bearing the same terms 
the newly issued shares increased our total common shares outstanding from  to  tonga owned of our outstanding shares immediately after the partial conversion 
pursuant to the conversion  the exercise price of  shares underlying the warrant was set at per share 
the exercise price of the remaining shares will be set accordingly upon the conversion  if any  of the remainder of the note 
we are required to register the shares underlying the note and warrants 
also  asi is generally restricted from issuing additional equity securities without tonga s consent  and the holder has a right of first refusal as to certain subsequent financings 
in addition  we are obligated to continue the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market pursuant to the note and warrant purchase agreement entered into with tonga  our controlling beneficial shareholder  and any breach of this obligation might result in the acceleration of the company s obligations under the senior secured convertible note payable to tonga 
as part of the transaction  tonga was granted the opportunity to appoint a majority of asi s board of directors and  as a result  controls asi 
in addition  upon exercise of the warrants and conversion of the note  tonga will own a majority of the common stock  thereby giving tonga additional control over asi 
on december   we issued million shares of no par value series a preferred stock  at an original issue price of per share 
we are entitled to redeem the shares within one year of issuance at per share million  and the redemption price increases 
per year until the fifth anniversary  at which time the shares must be redeemed at a price of per share 
as of the date of this report  we have not redeemed the shares 
the agreement calls for a mandatory payment of  by the third anniversary 
the preferred stock earns a dividend at the annual rate of of the then redemption price on a cumulative  non participating basis and has a liquidation preference equal to the then redemption value of shares outstanding at the time of such liquidation 
during the fiscal years of through  we experienced significant operating losses with corresponding reductions in working capital and net worth  excluding the impact of debt forgiveness  and do not currently have any external financing in place to support operating cash flow requirements 
our revenues and backlog have also decreased substantially during the same period 
our senior secured convertible note also contains customary default provisions  which if triggered and exercised  would make it difficult for us to meet these debt payments 
to address the going concern issue  management has implemented financial and operational restructuring plans designed to improve operating efficiencies  reduce and eliminate cash losses and position asi for profitable operations 
in fiscal  we improved our working capital position by reducing our bank debt 
table of contents through the issuance of preferred stock and convertible debt and with the collection of a million federal income tax refund 
the consolidation of our production operations in fiscal to two solution centers has resulted in lower general and administrative costs and improved operating efficiencies 
additionally  the relocation of our corporate headquarters has resulted in additional savings realized with a smaller corporate staff and efficiencies in occupancy and travel related expenses 
our sales and marketing team is pursuing market opportunities in both our traditional digital mapping and newly launched data management initiatives 
we continue to focus on cost control as we develop the data management initiative 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and the classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
however  we believe that our turnaround efforts  if successful  will improve operations and generate sufficient cash to meet our obligations in a timely manner 
in the absence of a line of credit and limitations on securing additional debt  we depend on internal cash flow to sustain operations 
internal cash flow is significantly affected by customer contract terms and progress achieved on projects 
fluctuations in internal cash flow are reflected in three contract related accounts accounts receivable  revenues in excess of billings  and billings in excess of revenues 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting accounts receivable is created when an amount becomes due from a customer  which typically occurs when an event specified in the contract triggers a billing 
revenues in excess of billings occur when we have performed under a contract even though a billing event has not been triggered 
billings in excess of revenues occur when we receive an advance or deposit against work yet to be performed 
these accounts  which represent a significant investment by us in our business  affect our cash flow as projects are signed  performed  billed and collected 
at september   we had multiple contracts with four customers  each of which accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues in fiscal one customer accounted for of total accounts receivable and revenue in excess of billings at september  at september   three customers represented  and  respectively of the total balance of net accounts receivable and revenue in excess of billings 
billing terms are negotiated in a competitive environment and  as stated above  are based on reaching project milestones 
we anticipate that sufficient billing milestones will be achieved during fiscal such that revenue in excess of billings for these customer contracts will begin to decline 
our operating activities used million cash in fiscal and provided positive cash flow of million in fiscal and million in fiscal contract related accounts described in the previous paragraph declined million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million in fiscal and decreased million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal reflects the company s reduced size of operations  in part due to the sale of our colorado springs  colorado office
