the purchase price consisted of million aggregate par value of year  redeemable  convertible  preferred stock of bridge  which was included in other investments  and cash of million 
under the terms of the sale  dow jones retained its guarantee of payments under certain circumstances of certain annual minimum payments for data acquired by telerate from cantor fitzgerald securities and market data corporation mdc under contracts entered into during the period when telerate was a subsidiary of dow jones contract guarantee 
the annual minimum payments average approximately million per year through october under certain conditions 
bridge agreed to indemnify dow jones for any liability dow jones incurred under the contract guarantee with respect to periods subsequent to bridge s purchase of telerate 
however  bridge filed for bankruptcy protection on february  after unsuccessful attempts to reorganize its operations and arrange for additional financing 
dow jones believes that cantor fitzgerald and mdc have the obligation to cover  mitigate or otherwise reduce and or avoid any losses or damages under these circumstances  including by securing the best possible commercial terms for the supply of the subject data to a third party or parties 
cantor and mdc deny that they have this obligation 
dow jones believes that any and all amounts which are received by cantor fitzgerald and or mdc in respect of such data would reduce any liability that dow jones might have under the contract guarantee 
as of december   however  there was a high degree of uncertainty as to what value the data might have in the marketplace  whether an agreement will be reached by cantor fitzgerald and or mdc to supply the data to a third party or parties  the financial position of such party or parties  the timing of any such agreement  and various related factors 
therefore  it was not possible for dow jones to determine with any certainty that any such offsets would in fact be realized  or at what time or in what amounts 
consequently  in december  the company established a reserve in the amount of million representing the present value of the total estimated annual minimum payments of about million over the remainder of the contract through october and using a discount rate of approximately at december   the company s reserve for the contract guarantee was million 
earnings in included income of million resulting from bridge fulfilling its payment obligation to cantor during its post petition bankruptcy phase  which was partially offset by the accretion of discount on the reserve balance of million 
dow jones made one payment of million for amounts not paid by bridge prior to its bankruptcy 
earnings in included accretion charges of million  which increased the reserve balance as of december  to million 
the company has classified million of this reserve as current based on the original due dates of the contract 
in october  the bankruptcy court granted bridge s motion to reject telerate s contracts with cantor and mdc 
telerate has indicated that it has ceased operations and is no longer receiving the government securities data from cantor and mdc and will not be making payments to cantor and mdc 
cantor and mdc advised the company that they would be seeking payment from dow jones of an amount they allege was due on november  under the contract guarantee and future payments due through the company has various substantial defenses to these claims 
on november   the company instituted a lawsuit in the supreme court of the state of new york seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to the contract guarantee and the claims of cantor and mdc 
in this lawsuit the company has asked the court to find that the company does not and will not owe any payment under the contract guarantee through october in the alternative  the company has asked the court to find that if any amount is owed  it must be reduced by amounts that cantor and mdc receive or should have received from other distribution of the data 
cantor fitzgerald and mdc have filed counterclaims  and an additional lawsuit against the company disagreeing with the company s position and asserting damages of approximately million 
arguments were heard in august on the parties respective motions to grant their own claims and to dismiss the competing claims 
the court rendered a decision in january denying these motions in all material respects 
thus  the case is expected to enter the discovery phase shortly

revenues of the company are largely collected in us dollars 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that such expenses will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
such losses could be significant if a major devaluation were to occur 
by using these derivative instruments the company is exposed to the adverse effect that a change in currency has on the value of a financial instrument 
the company manages this market risk by establishing and monitoring limits as to the degree of risk that may be undertaken 
the company s derivative activities are monitored by its treasury and finance functions

critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following are significant accounting policies of the company advertising revenue  net of commissions  is recognized in the period in which the advertisement is displayed 
the company s advertising rate card reflects certain volume based discounts  which require management to make certain estimates regarding future advertising volume 
these estimated rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the advertisement is displayed and are revised as necessary based on actual volume realized 
online related advertising revenue based on a minimum number of impressions is recognized as impressions occur 
revenue recognition from subscriptions to the company s print publications and information services is recognized in income as earned  pro rata on a per issue basis  over the subscription period 
circulation revenue includes sales to retail outlets newsstands  which are subject to returns 
the company records these retail sales upon delivery  net of estimated returns 
these estimated returns are based on historical return rates and are revised as necessary based on actual returns realized 
costs in connection with the procurement of subscriptions are charged to expense as incurred 
revenue from licensing the dow jones averages includes both upfront one time fees and ongoing revenue 
both upfront fees and ongoing licensing revenue are recognized in income as earned over the license period 
accounts receivable includes an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is an estimate of amounts that may not be collectible 
this estimated allowance is based on historical trends  review of aging categories and the specific identification of certain customers that are at risk of not paying 
actual write offs of bad debt have historically been insignificant  less than of revenues 
certain costs and related obligations of the company are based on actuarial assumptions  including some of its pension plans and the cost of the company s postretirement medical plan  which provides lifetime healthcare benefits to retirees who meet specified length of service and age requirements 
these benefit costs are expensed over the employee s expected employment period 
at december   the company s postretirement retiree medical benefit obligation was million  which is not funded as it is the company s policy to fund postretirement medical costs as claims are incurred 
in determining the cost of retiree medical costs  some factors that management must consider include the expected increase in health care costs  discount rates and turnover and mortality rates 
the discount rate is based on the yield of high quality  year  corporate bonds at december  while other assumptions are updated periodically based on recent actual trends 
increasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and increased the cost for by million 
conversely  a one percentage point decline in assumed health care cost trend rates would have lowered the benefit obligation at the end of by million and the cost for by million 
the majority of the company s employees who meet specific length of service requirements are covered by defined contribution retirement plans 
substantially all employees who are not covered by these plans are covered by defined benefit pension plans based on length of service and age requirements 
at december   the company s projected pension benefit obligation was million  of which million was funded 
in determining the cost and obligation of the defined pension benefit plans  management must consider such factors as the expected return on plan assets  discount rates and expected employee salary increases 
while the company believes its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or changes in these assumptions would affect the calculation of its projected obligation and cost under the defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans 
management must use its judgment in assessing whether the carrying value of certain long lived assets  cost method investments  identifiable intangibles and goodwill is impaired and if any asset is impaired  the extent of any such loss 
certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and require an impairment review 
based on that review  if the carrying value of these assets exceeds fair value and is determined to not be recoverable  an impairment loss representing the amount of excess over its fair value would be recognized in income 
fair value estimates are based on quoted market values in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
management also exercises judgment in determining the estimated useful life of long lived assets  specifically plant and property and certain intangible assets with a finite life 
the company depreciates the cost of buildings over years  improvements to the buildings over years  software over to years and machinery and equipment over to years 
the year life is applicable to the company s press equipment 
the cost of leasehold improvements is depreciated over the lesser of the useful lives or the terms of the respective leases 
management bases its judgment on estimated lives of these assets based on actual experienced length of service of similar assets and expert opinions 
the company maintains a stock incentive plan under the dow jones long term incentive plan 
this plan provides for the grant of contingent stock rights  stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and other stock based awards 
the company accounts for its stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb and its related interpretations 
under apb  pretax stock based compensation charged to income principally in relation to the company s contingent stock rights and restricted stock awards was million in  million in and million in had the company s stock based compensation been determined by the fair value based method of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  the company s earnings per share for  and would have been reduced by roughly 
per share  
per share and 
per share  respectively 
management must exercise judgment in assessing the likely outcome of contingencies and legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and those described in note to the financial statements 
both the timing and amount of the provisions made in the financial statements and related disclosures represent management s judgment of likelihood  based on information available at the time and on the advice of legal counsel 
judicial or governmental bodies largely determine the outcome of these matters 
the ultimate resolution of these matters  either by determinations by these bodies or other means  could be materially different from that assumed by the company in makings its provisions and related disclosures 
the company records a tax valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
currently  the company maintains a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to its capital loss carryforward 
the company has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made
