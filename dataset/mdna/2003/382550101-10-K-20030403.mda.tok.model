critical accounting policies  accounting estimates and uncertainties general market uncertainties goodyear s results of operations  financial position and liquidity could be adversely affected in future periods by loss of market share or lower demand in the replacement market or from the original equipment industry  which would result in lower levels of plant utilization that would increase unit costs 
also  goodyear could experience unexpected higher raw material and energy prices in future periods 
these costs  if incurred  may not be 
table of contents recoverable due to pricing pressures present in today s highly competitive market 
goodyear is unable to predict future currency fluctuations 
sales and earnings in future periods would be unfavorably impacted if the us dollar strengthens versus various foreign currencies 
a continuation of the current economic downturn in the us and europe is likely to unfavorably impact goodyear s sales and earnings in future periods 
similarly  continued volatile economic conditions in emerging markets could adversely affect sales and earnings in future periods 
goodyear may also be impacted by economic disruptions associated with global events including war  acts of terror and civil obstructions 
on april   goodyear s master contract with the united steelworkers of america will expire 
it is uncertain at this time whether an agreement will be reached without interruption of production  and the terms of the agreement ultimately reached could result in higher wage and benefit costs in the united states 
critical accounting policies  use of estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  recoverability of intangibles and other long lived assets  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  warranty  workers compensation  litigation  general and product liabilities  environmental liabilities  pension and postretirement benefits  and various other operating allowances and accruals  based on currently available information 
changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods 
general and product liability and other litigation 
the ultimate liability of goodyear in respect of the various claims  lawsuits and other legal proceedings to which it is a party cannot be estimated with certainty 
goodyear s accounting policy is to determine whether a liability should be recorded  and to estimate the amount of such liability based on the information available and assumptions and methods it has concluded are appropriate  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  and related pronouncements 
as additional information becomes available  goodyear will reassess its evaluation of the pending claims  lawsuits and other proceedings 
at december   goodyear had recorded liabilities totaling million million at december  for potential product liability and other tort claims  including related legal fees expected to be incurred  presently asserted against goodyear 
generally  the amount recorded was determined on the basis of an assessment of the potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims  historical experience and  where available  current trends 
goodyear has established a liability  as part of its general and product liability  in respect of the approximately  asbestos claims pending at december  approximately  claims at december   and an asset for expected recoveries under coverage in place agreements with certain primary insurance carriers 
the claims relate to alleged exposure to asbestos in certain rubber coated products manufactured by goodyear in the past or to asbestos in certain goodyear facilities 
during  goodyear received approximately  new asbestos claims and resolved approximately  asbestos claims  compared to approximately  new claims and  claims resolved in the amount spent on asbestos litigation defense and claim resolution before recovery of insurance proceeds was million during compared to million during the portion of the recorded liabilities relating to asbestos claims is based on pending claims only 
the amount recorded reflects an estimate of the cost of defending and resolving pending claims  based on available information and our experience in disposing of asbestos claims in the past 
no liability has been recorded for unknown asbestos claims  and goodyear cannot predict the number of future asbestos claims  the ultimate cost of disposing of existing and future claims  or the future ability to recover from insurance carriers 
goodyear believes it will recover a substantial portion of its liability from the proceeds of existing insurance policies  most of which are not subject to coverage in place agreements 

table of contents goodyear also has claims asserted in other legal proceedings to which it is currently a party 
the company appealed judgments of million and million in civil actions in colorado state court  related to alleged breaches of warranties and defects in the company s entran ii hose installed as a part of heatway radiant heating systems in the property of the claimants 
the company believes the verdicts were based on material errors of fact and law 
the company is also a defendant in eight class actions and five other civil actions in various federal and state courts related to the company s entran ii hose installed in the homes or other structures of the claimants 
the company is also party to a class action relating to alleged breaches of warranty or product defects relating to certain of goodyear s load range d and e light truck tires 
goodyear s recorded liability for general and product liability other than asbestos claims is based on assumptions about the number of claims filed and expected to be filed and the amount expected to be paid per claim 
the expected number of claims is developed based in part on industry statistics and past claims experience 
the amount expected to be paid per claim is based in part on whether the claim involves goodyear s products or other alleged tort liability 
it also includes assumptions about future judicial actions related to the potential aggregation of claims  expected trends in litigation costs and the nature of claims not yet received or reviewed by goodyear 
if the actual experience differs from expectations  goodyear s results of operations  financial position and liquidity would be affected 
subject to the uncertainties referred to above  goodyear has concluded that in respect of any of the above described liabilities  it is not reasonably possible that it would incur a loss exceeding the amount currently accrued for at december   with respect thereto which would be material relative to the consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity of goodyear at december   although an unanticipated adverse final determination in these proceedings could have a material impact on goodyear s results of operations  financial position and liquidity in any quarter or for the year 
environmental matters 
at december   goodyear had recorded liabilities totaling million million at december  for anticipated costs related to various environmental matters  primarily the remediation of numerous waste disposal sites and certain properties sold by goodyear 
these costs include legal and consulting fees  site studies  the design and implementation of remediation plans  post remediation monitoring and related activities and will be paid over several years 
the amount of goodyear s ultimate liability in respect of these matters may be affected by several uncertainties  primarily the ultimate cost of required remediation and the extent to which other responsible parties contribute 
workers compensation 
goodyear had recorded liabilities totaling million and million for anticipated costs related to workers compensation at december  and  respectively 
the costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on goodyear s assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims  historical experience  and current cost trends 
the amount of goodyear s ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
at december   goodyear had valuation allowances aggregating billion against all of its net federal and state and some of its international subsidiaries deferred tax assets 
the net federal and state deferred tax assets are almost entirely composed of deductions available to reduce federal and state taxable income in future years 
the international deferred tax assets include loss carryforwards as well as deductions available to reduce future international taxable income 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas  evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability which are inherently uncertain 
goodyear s us losses in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against its net federal and state deferred tax assets under sfas goodyear intends to maintain a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of the federal and state deferred tax assets 

table of contents pensions and postretirement benefits 
goodyear s recorded liability for pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions is based on a number of assumptions  including future health care costs  maximum company covered benefit costs  life expectancies  retirement rates  discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets and future compensation levels 
certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of outside actuaries 
assumptions about health care costs  life expectancies  retirement rates and future compensation levels are based on past experience and anticipated future trends  including an assumption about inflation 
discount rates are based on market indicators at the time these assumptions are established 
the expected return on plan assets is determined using historical compound annualized returns of goodyear s pension fund for or more years 
these assumptions are regularly reviewed and revised when appropriate  and changes in one or more of them could affect the amount of goodyear s recorded expenses for these benefits 
if the actual experience differs from expectations  goodyear s financial position  results of operations and liquidity in future periods could be affected 
as of december   the aggregate projected benefit obligation for goodyear s pension plans was billion 
a basis point change in the us discount rate would change the projected benefit obligation and accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately million and would impact pension expense in by approximately million 
as of december   goodyear s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was billion 
a basis point change in the discount rate for its main us plans would change the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million and would impact postretirement benefit expense by approximately million 
effective january   goodyear has reduced its expected return on us pension plan assets from to to reflect lower expectations for long term investment returns 
this change is expected to increase pension expense approximately million for the year 
amortization of existing losses is expected to increase pension expense substantially in future periods 
the investment mix of the us pension assets is typically approximately equities and bonds 
goodyear s us pension asset returns were a negative for the year ended december  the unfunded amount of goodyear s benefit obligation at december  was billion  compared to billion at december  for the year ended december   goodyear incurred a billion charge to accumulated other comprehensive income for unfunded pension benefit obligations  compared to a million charge for the year ended december  if market conditions continue to deteriorate  these charges could continue to increase in future periods 
although subject to change in view of the volatility of the capital markets  based on current estimates  goodyear expects to make contributions to its domestic pension plans of approximately million to million in in order to satisfy statutory minimum funding requirements 
goodyear will be subject to additional statutory minimum funding requirements after the amount of funding requirements could be substantial and will be based on a number of factors  including the value of the pension assets at the time as well as the interest rate for the relevant period

turnaround strategy the company is currently implementing the initial stages of a turnaround strategy for the north american tire segment which will require the company to stabilize margins and market shares  simplify the sales and supply chain process  execute key cost cutting  brand and distribution strategies and grow the business through new product introductions and new sales channels 
there is no assurance that the company will successfully implement this turnaround strategy

the company s  million of bank finance facilities mature in and  and the company would have to refinance these facilities in the capital markets if they were not renewed by the banks 
because of its debt ratings  recent operating performance and other factors  the company believes its access to such markets at the present is limited 
the company s ability to improve its access to the capital markets is highly dependent on successfully implementing its turnaround strategy 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing its turnaround strategy 
failure to successfully complete the turnaround strategy could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and liquidity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk goodyear actively manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix  within defined limitations  using refinancings and unleveraged interest rate swaps 
goodyear will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce goodyear s risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates  and are normally designated as cash flow hedges 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates 
interest rate swap contracts are thus used by goodyear to separate interest rate risk management from debt funding decisions 
at december   the interest rates on of goodyear s debt were fixed by either the nature of the obligation or through the interest rate swap contracts  compared to at december  goodyear also from time to time enters into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the risk free component of anticipated long term debt issuances 
no interest rate lock contracts were outstanding at december  or the following tables present information at december dollars in millions interest rate swap contracts fixed rate contracts notional principal amount pay fixed rate receive variable libor average years to maturity fair value liability pro forma fair value liability floating rate contracts notional principal amount pay variable libor receive fixed rate average years to maturity fair value asset pro forma fair value asset the pro forma fair value assumes a decrease in variable market interest rates at december of each year  and reflects the estimated fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption

the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the precision of the model decreases as the assumed change in interest rates increases 
foreign currency exchange risk in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows  goodyear enters into foreign currency contracts 
these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables  equipment acquisitions  intercompany loans and royalty agreements and forecasted purchases and sales 
in addition  the principal and interest on goodyear s swiss franc bond due and euro million of the euro notes due are hedged by currency swap agreements 
contracts hedging the swiss franc bond  the euro notes and forecasted transactions under intercompany royalty agreements are designated as cash flow hedges 
the hedged intercompany royalty transactions will occur during contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation
