item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  warranty costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long term assets  especially goodwill and intangibles  contract manufacturer exposures for excess and obsolete material  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
overview juniper networks  inc juniper networks or we was founded in to develop and sell products that would be able to meet the stringent demands of service providers 
the world s leading network operators  government agencies  research and education institutions  and information intensive enterprises now rely upon us as the foundation for uncompromising networks 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these policies include revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which impacts general and administrative expenses  the valuation of exposures associated with the contract manufacturing operations and estimating future warranty costs  which impact cost of product revenues and gross margins  and the initial and continuing valuation of certain long lived assets  especially goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  which could result in an impairment  which would impact operating expenses 
we have other equally important accounting policies and practices  however  once adopted  these other policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy not a judgment as to policy itself 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
specifically  product revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured  unless we have future obligations for such things as network interoperability or customer acceptance  in which case revenue and related costs are deferred until those obligations are met 
in most cases  we recognize product revenue upon shipment to our customers  including resellers  as it is our policy to ensure an end user has been identified prior to shipment 
our ability to recognize revenue in the future will be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers and by our assessment of collectibility 
we assess the probability of collection by reviewing our customers payment history  financial condition and credit report 
if the probability of collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until the payment is collected 
the amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is also impacted by our judgments taken in establishing our reserve for potential future product returns 
although our arrangements do not include any contractual rights of return  and our general policy is that we do not accept returns  under unique circumstances we have and may in the future accept product returns from our customers 
therefore  we do provide a reserve for our estimate of future returns against revenue in the period the revenue is recorded 
our estimate of future returns is based on such factors as historical return data and current economic condition of our customer base 
in addition  we get input from our sales and support organizations with respect to specific customer issues 
the amount of revenue we recognize going forward will be directly impacted by our estimates made to establish the reserve for potential future product returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and assess current economic trends affecting our customers that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and result in different rates of bad debts than previously seen 
our reserves have historically been 
table of contents adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers or the industries that we sell to  we cannot guarantee that our current level of reserves will continue to be adequate 
if actual credit losses were to be significantly greater than the reserves we have established  that would increase our general and administrative expenses 
conversely  if actual credit losses were to be significantly less than our reserves  our general and administrative expenses would decrease 
contract manufacturer exposures we outsource the majority of our manufacturing  repair operations and supply chain management operations to our three independent contract manufacturers 
accordingly  a significant portion of the cost of revenues consists of payments to them 
our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture products based on build forecasts we provide them 
our forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products 
our estimates of future demand for our products are based on historical trends and a bottoms up analysis from our sales and support organizations  adjusted for overall market conditions 
if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast  we have contractual liabilities and exposures with all of the contract manufacturers  such as carrying costs and excess material exposures  which would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
the majority of the factors that affect component usage and demand for our products are outside of our control 
warranty reserves we offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products as well as a day warranty on the software embedded in the products 
the warranty generally includes parts  labor and hour service center support 
the specific terms and conditions of those warranties may vary depending on the products sold and the locations into which they are sold 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations and record a liability and charge to cost of product sales in the amount of such costs at the time revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim 
our estimates of anticipated rates of warranty claims and costs per claim are primarily based on historical information 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
if actual warranty claims are significantly higher than forecast  or if the actual costs incurred to provide the warranty is greater than the forecast  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill and purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
for business combinations consummated before july   goodwill was amortized through december  using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of three years 
goodwill is not amortized for business combinations consummated after june  amortization of purchased intangibles is computed using the straight line method over the related expected useful lives of between two and six years 
when valuing goodwill and purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment  we estimate future cash flows and useful lives 
these estimates include discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the products with which the technology or other identified intangibles is associated and the periods of time with which the products will be in demand 
we perform goodwill impairment tests annually and on an interim basis in certain circumstances 
we performed an impairment analysis as of january  and again in november and determined that there was no impairment of the goodwill at either time 
in addition  we review each purchased intangible asset quarterly and assess if the amortization period is still appropriate 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents unisphere business combination in july  we completed our acquisition of unisphere networks  inc unisphere  a subsidiary of siemens corporation which is a subsidiary of siemens ag siemens 
following the acquisition and during the remainder of  siemens  itself and through its local country affiliates  was one of our significant resellers 
unisphere developed  manufactured and sold data networking equipment optimized for applications at the edge of service provider networks 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations  we have included in our results of operations for the results of unisphere from july  the unisphere acquisition resulted in significant impacts to revenue  cost of revenues and all operating expenses for the second half of the results for will include a full year of results of the combined companies 
results of operations net revenues the following table shows product and service net revenues for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  of net of net of net revenues revenues revenues net revenues product service total net revenues product net revenues decreased million in compared with our net product revenues for were derived from the sale of all of our products from  plus from the sale of the following new products t series core internet routers  j series wireless router  which was developed through our joint venture with ericsson ab  e series internet routers  which includes the product acquired through the unisphere business combination  and g series cable routers  which are cable modem termination system cmts products that were developed using the technology acquired through the pacific broadband communications business combination 
the decrease in product net revenues in compared with was due primarily to a decrease in the demand for our products that resulted from the generally unfavorable economic conditions throughout the decrease was also due to lower average selling prices as a result of a shift in product mix 
for  one customer accounted for of net product revenues  compared to  where three customers each accounted for  and of net product revenues 
product net revenues increased million in compared with three of our five product platforms available during m  m and m were introduced during with the first full year of shipments for these products occurring in resulting in an increase in net revenues for compared to the increase in product net revenues was also the result of the continuing increase in market acceptance of our products and  especially in early  the overall growth in the marketplace due to the growth of data traffic on the internet and an increase in the number of customers and networks 
one customer accounted for of net product revenues in service net revenues increased million in compared with service net revenues increased as a result of a larger installed base of customers and products 
a vast majority of service 
table of contents revenue is from customers who previously purchased our products and enter into a service contract 
in addition to service contracts  service revenue is generated from providing professional and educational services 
service contracts are typically for one year periods and revenue is recognized ratably over the service period 
service net revenues increased million in compared with the increase in service net revenues was primarily the result of a larger installed base of customers and products resulting from the continuing increase in market acceptance of our products and  especially in early  the overall growth in the marketplace due to the growth of data traffic on the internet and an increase in the number of customers and networks 
the following table shows net revenue and the percent of total net revenues by geographic region year ended december  americas europe asia total we experienced a shift in net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues from the americas region to europe and asia in as the capital spending market in the united states declined 
cost of revenues the following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin percentages for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  gross gross gross margin margin margin cost of revenues product service total cost of revenues our gross margins are highly variable and dependent on many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
we have outsourced the majority of our manufacturing  repair operations and supply chain management operations 
accordingly  a significant portion of the cost of revenues consists of payments to our three independent contract manufacturers 
the independent contract manufacturers manufacture our products using quality assurance programs and standards that we established 
controls around manufacturing  engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale  california and westford  massachusetts 
our independent contract manufacturers have facilities in milpitas  california  neenah  wisconsin and toronto  canada 
as of december  two of our contract manufacturers retained title to the underlying components and finished goods inventory until our customers take title to the assembled final product upon shipment from the contract manufacturer s facility 
as of december   the third contract manufacturer retained title until title is transferred to our customers upon shipment from our westford facility  where the contract manufacturer performs final configuration  assembly  testing and packaging 
as of january   the third contract manufacturer performs all manufacturing and final configuration  assembly  testing and packaging at its facilities and retains title to the underlying components and finished goods inventory until our customers take title upon shipment from the contract manufacturer s facility 
as of december   we had inventory valued at million located at our westford facility included in other current assets 
cost of product revenues decreased million in compared with the decrease in absolute dollars was directly related to the decrease in product revenue  which was primarily a result of 
table of contents unfavorable economic conditions many customers experienced throughout  as well as to a charge of million for excess materials exposure with our contract manufacturers 
no significant such charges were recorded in for materials exposure matters  but  in accordance with the purchase accounting rules of sfas  we did recognize one time charges of million in relating to the unisphere acquisition 
the charge of million included million for backlog orders and million for an inventory write up adjustment 
product gross margins were flat as a result of operational costs being cut as the demand for our products decreased 
we did not utilize any previously reserved inventory in we expect our product gross margins to slightly increase in  as compared to cost of product revenues increased million in compared with the increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to the increase in product net revenues  as well as head count increases in our manufacturing support organizations 
in addition  in  we incurred a charge of million relating to an excess materials exposure with our contract manufacturers 
the decrease in product gross margins was primarily a result of costs in our manufacturing support organizations increasing more than our product revenues as we originally intended to increase the size of the organization to meet future demand  however as the economy weakened in  the expected demand did not materialize 
in addition  the excess materials charge of million negatively impacted the gross margin  as compared to cost of service revenues decreased million in compared with the decrease in absolute dollars and increase in service gross margins were primarily due to realized savings in our service organization for personnel and other related costs associated with our restructuring activities  while service revenue increased as a result of a larger installed base of customers and products 
the increase in gross margin reflects the benefits of increased service revenues and a more appropriately sized service organization for our current level of operations 
we expect our service gross margins to increase in  as compared to cost of service revenues increased million in compared with the increase in absolute dollars is primarily related to the increase in service contracts  which necessitated head count increases in our service organization 
the increase in gross margins was primarily a result of the service organization being built in to meet anticipated future demand 
research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the following table shows research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  of net of net of net revenues revenues revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative the million increase in research and development expenses in compared with was primarily a result of an increase in headcount related expenses  the use of outside services and certain overhead costs  partially offset by savings in prototype equipment 
headcount related expenses and overhead costs increased primarily due to the unisphere acquisition 
we realized savings in internally developed and prototype equipment expense during because throughout we were preparing for the release of our high end t series products  as well as certain m series and j series products  and developing and testing our application specific integrated circuits asics 

table of contents the million increase in research and development expenses in compared with was primarily related to increased salary and related personnel costs as we increased headcount to expand development efforts in new products such as t  t  me and j we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures  the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability in our expenses 
for example  a large number of prototypes are required to build and test our products and the building and testing process occurs over a short period of time 
our asic development requires a payment for non recurring engineering charges at the beginning of the process to design and develop the asic 
we expense such charges immediately 
in addition  per unit costs are payable when we purchase the prototype asics 
with several large asics in our architecture  we will incur large non recurring engineering and prototype expenses with each significant enhancement of the existing products and for any new product development 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
we believe that research and development is critical to our strategic product development objectives and that to leverage our leading technology and meet the changing requirements of our customers  we will need to fund investments in several development projects in parallel 
although we may experience significant quarterly variability in our research and development expenses  we expect our annual research and development expenses to be flat to slightly increase in absolute dollars in the next year 
the million decrease in sales and marketing expenses in compared with was a result of decreases in employee and partner events  the reduced use of demonstration equipment  which is expensed immediately  and consolidation of excess facilities 
to date  we have not incurred significant advertising expenses 
the million increase in sales and marketing expenses in compared with was primarily attributable to salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  marketing and customer engineering support functions as we increased headcount during the year 
in addition  costs associated with promotional and other marketing activities such as product launches and equipment for demonstration and competitive labs contributed to the increase in we intend to continue to focus and expand our sales and marketing efforts across all the geographies and markets we serve in order to increase market awareness of our products and to better support our existing customers worldwide 
we believe that continued investment in sales and marketing is critical to our success and expect these expenses to slightly increase in absolute dollars in the next year as we initiate additional sales and marketing programs to support our products 
general and administrative expenses decreased million in compared with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting and human resources personnel  as well as recruiting expenses  professional fees  bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses 
the decrease was due to savings in headcount related expenses and decreases in the use of outside services 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will slightly decrease in  as compared to general and administrative expenses increased million in compared with the increase was primarily attributable to the costs associated with additional headcount to support increased levels of business activity  as well as increases in the bad debt provision 
other operating expenses the following table shows other operating expenses for the years ended december   and in thousands 
table of contents year ended december  amortization of goodwill amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation restructuring and other in process research and development integration charitable contribution in july  we completed the acquisition of unisphere  a subsidiary of siemens 
following the acquisition and during the remainder of  siemens was one of our significant resellers 
the acquisition resulted in the payment of million cash and the issuance of million shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately million to the former stockholders of unisphere 
we accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method of accounting  in accordance with sfas accordingly  we originally recorded goodwill of million  purchased intangible assets of million  in process research and development ipr d of million and deferred compensation on unvested stock options of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the goodwill is not amortized but rather we are required to test the goodwill for impairment at least annually  and at interim periods if necessary 
the purchased intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives  generally between two and six years 
the deferred compensation is being amortized over four years using the graded vesting method 
in december  we adjusted the originally recorded goodwill of by decreasing it by million  primarily related to the valuation of certain assets where we were awaiting further information when we originally allocated the purchase price 
the purchase price allocation depicted is preliminary and subject to change as we continue to obtain additional information concerning the fair values of certain liabilities of unisphere 
in december and  we acquired pacific broadband communications pacific broadband and micro magic inc micro magic  respectively 
we accounted for both of these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of million and million  respectively  representing the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired 
the goodwill and other intangibles were being amortized over their respective useful lives  which we determined to be between two and three years 
in accordance with sfas  there was no goodwill amortization related to the pacific broadband acquisition in and beginning on january   we no longer amortized goodwill relating to the micro magic acquisition 
during  goodwill from the pacific broadband business combination increased as a result of the earn out provisions of the acquisition agreement and decreased for certain liabilities that were accrued for at the time of acquisition that were not realized 
neither of these transactions had an impact on our results of operations for the year ended december  there was no amortization of goodwill in in accordance with sfas amortization of goodwill increased million in compared with the increase was a result of a full year of amortization of goodwill from the micro magic  inc acquisition 
amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation decreased million in compared with amortization of purchased intangibles was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase was due to the acquisition of unisphere  which contributed million in amortization of purchased intangibles during the second half of  and a full year of amortization during from the pacific broadband acquisition 
amortization of deferred stock compensation was million and million in and  respectively 
the primary reason for the decrease was a reversal  as required by apb  of million in previously recognized stock compensation expense 
this reversal related to the difference between the expense that had been 
table of contents previously recognized under the graded vesting method for former employees and the expense that would have been recorded using the straight line method 
finally  the decrease in expense is also a result of using the graded vesting method  which expenses a larger percent in the earlier months 
amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation increased million in compared with the increase was almost entirely due to a full year of amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation from the micro magic acquisition 
the amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation will increase in as a result of a full year of amortization of purchased intangible assets acquired from unisphere and may increase further in the future if we make other acquisitions of companies or technologies 
during the third quarter of  in connection with the acquisition of unisphere  we approved and initiated plans to restructure the operations to eliminate certain duplicative activities  focus on strategic product and customer bases  reduce cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions 
consequently  we recorded restructuring expenses of approximately million  net of a million adjustment for costs that were not going to be incurred due to a change in estimate  associated primarily with workforce related costs  costs of vacating duplicative facilities  contract termination costs  non inventory asset impairment charges and other associated costs 
these costs are accounted for under eitf issue no 
eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  and have been included as a charge to the results of operations for the year ended december  we also recognized a charge of approximately million during the quarter ended september  related to the land acquired in january located in sunnyvale  california 
the charge was primarily for costs of exiting certain contractual obligations associated with the land 
we currently have no plans to continue developing the land in the foreseeable future 
the carrying value of the land increased million during primarily due to certain development costs incurred in the first half of in june  we announced a restructuring program in an effort to better align our business operations with the current market and service provider industry conditions 
the restructuring program included a worldwide workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities and restructuring of certain business functions 
the costs associated with the restructuring program totaled million and were recorded during the three months ended june  as operating expenses 
restructuring and other costs increased million in compared with this increase was a result of the restructuring activities and land charge in the third quarter of of the total unisphere purchase price  approximately million has been allocated to in process research and development ipr d and was expensed in the quarter ended september  projects that qualify as ipr d represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
at the time of acquisition  unisphere had multiple ipr d efforts under way for certain current and future product lines 
these efforts included developing new cards and modules for different bandwidths and various software developments 
we utilized the discounted cash flow dcf method to value the ipr d  using rates ranging from to 
in applying the dcf method  the value of the acquired technology was estimated by discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the products with which the technology is associated  over the remaining economic life of the technology 
to distinguish between the cash flows attributable to the underlying technology and the cash flows attributable to other assets available for generating product revenues  adjustments were made to provide for a fair return to fixed assets  working capital and other assets that provide value to the product lines 
at the time of acquisition  it was estimated that these development efforts were complete and would be completed over the next six to twelve months 
as of december  these development efforts were complete and estimate that they will be completed over the next twelve months 

table of contents in connection with the acquisition of pacific broadband in december  we allocated million of the million purchase price as ipr d 
the applications from the in process technology project have been integrated into our products 
the efforts required to complete the acquired in process technology included the completion of all planning  designing and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design requirements  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the value of the acquired in process technology was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis rate of on the anticipated income stream of the related product revenues 
the discounted cash flow analysis was based on management s forecast of future revenues  cost of revenues  and operating expenses related to the products and technologies purchased from pacific broadband 
the calculation of value was then adjusted to reflect only the value creation efforts of pacific broadband prior to the close of the acquisition 
at the time of the acquisition  the product was approximately complete 
the majority of the costs to complete the project was incurred in fiscal and was not material 
the resultant value of in process technology was further reduced by the estimated value of core technology and was expensed in the period the transaction was consummated 
the project was complete as of december  in connection with the acquisition of micro magic in december  we allocated million of the million purchase price as ipr d

we incurred integration expenses of approximately million in the quarter ended september  resulting from our acquisition of unisphere 
integration expenses are one time incremental costs directly related to the integration of the two companies that have no go forward benefit  which consisted principally of workforce related expenses for individuals transitioning their positions and professional fees during the quarter ended september  we expect that all of the integration costs relating to the unisphere integration have been incurred and that there will be no additional integration costs in the future related to unisphere 
there were charitable contributions of million in in connection with common stock issued to a charitable foundation 
we have not made any similar contributions in or and we currently do not expect to make similar contributions in the foreseeable future 
other income and expenses the following table shows other income and expenses for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  interest income interest expense loss on investments equity in net loss of joint venture gain on retirement of convertible subordinated notes

in addition to this joint venture  ericsson is also one of our significant resellers  representing greater than of our revenues in and as of december   we have no further obligations to fund this joint venture 
in the quarter ended september   we paid approximately million to retire a portion of our convertible subordinated notes due march  the notes 
this partial retirement resulted in a gain of approximately million  which was the difference between the carrying value of the notes  including unamortized debt issuance costs  at the time of their retirement  and the amount paid to extinguish such notes 
we are currently evaluating plans to retire additional notes in the future  therefore  we do not consider the gains associated with this repurchase to be extraordinary  based on the guidance in sfas no

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
revises the accounting for exit and disposal activities under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  by spreading out the reporting of expenses related to restructuring activities 
a commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets will no longer be sufficient to record a one time charge for most restructuring activities 
instead  companies will record exit or disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value 
in addition  the resultant liabilities will be subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  companies may not restate previously issued financial statements for the effect of the provisions of sfas no 
 and liabilities that a company previously recorded under eitf issue are grandfathered 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  if we enter into any restructuring activities in the future  the adoption of sfas may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amount recognized under such costs 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value  which is different from current practice  where a liability is recorded when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
in addition  fin also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote  which is another change from current practice 
fin is applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements in fin regarding warranties herein this annual report see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 
we are currently evaluating the other requirements of fin if it is determined that the other requirements of fin apply to us  revenues  cost of goods sold and or operating expenses could be negatively affected 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas and apb no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
while sfas does not amend sfas to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas or the intrinsic value method of apb since we account for our stock based compensation under apb  and have no current plans on switching to sfas  the impact of sfas will be limited to the annual and interim reporting of the effects on net income and earnings per share as if we accounted for stock based compensation under sfas sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity vie  formerly referred to as special purpose entities 
fin applies to any business enterprise  both public and private  that has a controlling interest  contractual relationship or other business relationship with a vie 
fin provides guidance for determining when an entity the primary beneficiary should consolidate another entity  a vie  that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
we 
table of contents currently have no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a vie and therefore the adoption will not have an effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
we face intense competition that could reduce our market share 
competition in the network infrastructure market is intense 
this market has historically been dominated by cisco with other companies such as nortel networks and lucent technologies providing products to a smaller segment of the market 
in addition  a number of other small public or private companies have announced plans for new products to address the same challenges that our products address 
if we are unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors from a product offering standpoint or from potential price competition by such competitors  we could experience a loss in market share and or be required to reduce prices  resulting in reduced gross margins  either of which could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
the current economic conditions  combined with the financial condition of some of our customers  limit our visibility and makes revenue forecasting difficult 
the continuing economic downturn generally  and in the telecommunication industry specifically  combined with our own relatively limited operating history in the context of such a continuing economic downturn  makes it difficult to accurately forecast revenue 
we have experienced and expect  in the foreseeable future  to continue to experience limited visibility into our customers spending plans and capital budgets 
this limited visibility complicates our revenue forecasting process 
additionally  many customers funded their network infrastructure purchases through a variety of debt and similar instruments and many of these same customers are carrying a significant debt burden and are experiencing reduced cash flow with which to carry the cost of the debt and the corresponding interest charges  which reduces their ability to both justify and make future purchases 
the telecommunications industry has experienced consolidation and rationalization of its participants and we expect this trend to continue 
there have been adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt markets for telecommunications industry participants  which have affected their ability to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures 
in some cases the significant debt burden carried by these customers has reduced their ability to pay for the purchases made to date 
this has contributed  and we expect it to continue to contribute  to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of capital expenditures  further limiting visibility and complicating the forecasting process 
certain of these customers have filed for bankruptcy as a result of their debt burdens 
although these customers generally expect that they will emerge from the bankruptcy proceedings in the future  a bankruptcy proceeding can be a slow and cumbersome process further limiting the visibility and complicating the revenue forecasting process as to these customers 
even if they should emerge from such proceedings  the extent and timing of any future purchases of equipment is uncertain 
this uncertainty will further complicate the revenue forecasting process 
in addition  our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are  and will continue to be  fixed in the short term 
if we do not achieve our expected revenues  the operating results will be below our expectations and those of investors and market analysts  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

table of contents our failure to increase our revenues may prevent us from being profitable in future periods 
we have large fixed expenses and net revenues have declined over the past year 
there can be no assurances that net revenues will grow or that we will be profitable in future periods 
although our customer base has increased substantially  there are still a limited number of customers who comprise a significant portion of our revenues and any decrease in revenue from these customers could have an adverse effect 
even though our customer base has increased substantially  we expect that a large portion of our net revenues will continue to depend on sales to a limited number of customers 
any downturn in the business of these customers or potential new customers could significantly decrease sales to such customers that could adversely affect our net revenues and results of operations 
we rely on distribution partners to sell our products  and disruptions to these channels could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products 
we believe that our future success is dependent upon establishing successful relationships with a variety of distribution partners 
we have entered into agreements with several value added resellers  some of which also sell products that compete with our products 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain or attract resellers on a timely basis or at all  or that the resellers will devote adequate resources to selling our products 
our products are highly technical and if they contain undetected software or hardware errors  our business could be adversely impacted 
our products are highly technical and are designed to be deployed in very large and complex networks 
certain of our products can only be fully tested when deployed in networks that generate high amounts of data and or voice traffic 
as a result  we may experience errors in connection with such product and for new products and enhancements 
any defects or errors in our products discovered in the future could result in loss of or delay in revenue  loss of customers  increased service and warranty cost all of which could adversely impact our business and our results of operations 
if our products do not interoperate with our customers networks  installations will be delayed or cancelled and could result in substantial product returns  which could harm our business 
our products are designed to interface with our customers existing networks  each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards 
many of our customers networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved 
our products must interoperate with all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers requirements 
if we find errors in the existing software used in our customers networks  we must modify our software to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate and scale with the existing software and hardware 
if our products do not interoperate with those of our customers networks  installations could be delayed  orders for our products could be cancelled or our products could be returned 
this would also damage our reputation  which could seriously harm our business and prospects 
problems arising from use of our products in conjunction with other vendors products could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition 
service providers typically use our products in conjunction with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 

table of contents traditional telecommunications companies generally require more onerous terms and conditions of their vendors 
as we seek to sell more products to such customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse impact on our business 
traditional telecommunications companies because of their size generally have had greater purchasing power and accordingly have requested and received more favorable terms  which often translate into more onerous terms and conditions for their vendors 
as we seek to sell more products to this class of customer  we may be required to agree to such terms and conditions which may include terms that impact our ability to recognize revenue and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
in addition  many of this class of customer have purchased products from other vendors who promised certain functionality and failed to deliver such functionality and or had products that caused problems and outages in the networks of these customers 
as a result  this class of customer may request additional features from us and require substantial penalties for failure to deliver such features or may require substantial penalties for any network outages that may be caused by our products 
these additional requests and penalties  if we are required to agree to them  may impact our ability to recognize the revenue from such sales  which may negatively impact our business and our financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to anticipate market needs and to develop products and product enhancements that will meet those needs and gain market acceptance 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to anticipate future market needs or that we will be able to develop new products or product enhancements to meet such needs or to meet them in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate the market requirements or to develop new products or product enhancements to meet those needs  such failure could substantially decrease market acceptance and sales of our present and future products  which would significantly harm our business and financial results 
even if we are able to anticipate and develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements  there can be no assurance that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance 
any failure of our future products to achieve market acceptance could adversely affect the business and financial results 
we depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively in a rapidly changing market and if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel  our ability to develop  market and sell products could be harmed 
our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering  sales  marketing and support personnel 
none of the officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers  could delay the development and introduction of and negatively impact our ability to develop  market or sell our products 
in addition  although we completed the acquisition of unisphere on july   integration of the products  product roadmap and operations is a continuing activity and will be for the foreseeable future 
as a result of these activities  we may lose opportunities and employees  which could disrupt our business and harm our financial results 
if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays 
our contract manufacturers are not obligated to supply products for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order because we do not have long term supply contracts with them 
in addition  lead times for required materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for each component at a given time 
we provide to our contract manufacturers a 
table of contents demand forecast 
if we overestimate our requirements  the contract manufacturers may assess charges that could negatively impact our gross margins as was the case for the quarter ended september  
if we underestimate our requirements  the contract manufacturers may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and revenues 
we currently depend on contract manufacturers with whom we do not have long term supply contracts  and changes to those relationships  expected or unexpected  may result in delays or disruptions that could cause us to lose revenue and damage our customer relationships 
we depend on third party contract manufacturers each of whom is a third party manufacturer for numerous companies to manufacture our products 
we do not have a long term supply contract with such manufacturers and if we should fail to effectively manage our contract manufacturer relationships or if one or more of them should experience delays  disruptions or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations  our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
in connection with the acquisition of unisphere we added a third contract manufacturer and as part of the integration activities we are consolidating our contract manufacturing at two of the three current contract manufacturers 
the transition from three to two contract manufacturers may result in disruptions or quality control problems in manufacturing operations  delays in our ability to ship products to our customers all of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 
the transition is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of  however  this transition could be delayed be a number of factors  including  but not limited to  systems integration  economic conditions and process planning 
further  unisphere received semi finished goods from its contract manufacturer and engaged in final test and assembly of finished product at its facility in westford  massachusetts 
as a result  unisphere carried inventory on its books 
as part of the integration of unisphere we are outsourcing those activities to be consistent with our full outsource model 
if we should fail to effectively manage these activities we could experience disruptions or quality control problems or delays in shipments to our customers  all of which could adversely impact our business and financial results 
the long sales and implementation cycles for our products  as well as our expectation that customers will sporadically place large orders with short lead times may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a customer s decision to purchase our products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process 
as a result  the sales cycle may be lengthy 
throughout the sales cycle  we often spend considerable time educating and providing information to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
even after making the decision to purchase  customers tend to deploy the products slowly and deliberately 
timing of deployment can vary widely and depends on the skill set of the customer  the size of the network deployment  the complexity of the customer s network environment and the degree of hardware and software configuration necessary to deploy the products 
customers with large networks usually expand their networks in large increments on a periodic basis 
accordingly  we expect to receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular basis 
these long cycles  as well as our expectation that customers will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times  may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
we face risks associated with our restructuring plans that may adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in response to industry and market conditions  we have restructured our business and reduced our workforce 
the assumptions underlying our restructuring efforts will be assessed on an ongoing basis and may prove to be inaccurate and we may have to restructure our business again in the future to achieve certain cost savings and to strategically realign our resources 

table of contents our restructuring plan is based on certain assumptions regarding the cost structure of our business and the nature  severity  and duration of the current industry adjustment  which may not prove to be accurate 
while restructuring  we have assessed  and will continue to assess  whether we should further reduce our workforce  as well as review the recoverability of our tangible and intangible assets  including the land purchased in january any such decisions may result in the recording of additional charges  such as workforce reduction costs  facilities reduction costs  asset write downs  and contractual settlements 
additionally  estimates and assumptions used in asset valuations are subject to uncertainties  as are accounting estimates with respect to the useful life and ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  future market conditions may result in further charges for the write down of tangible and intangible assets 
we may not be able to successfully implement the initiatives we have undertaken in restructuring our business and  even if successfully implemented  these initiatives may not be sufficient to meet the changes in industry and market conditions and to achieve future profitability 
furthermore  our workforce reductions may impair our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 
lastly  costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may be higher than the estimated costs of such actions and or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings 
as a result  our restructuring efforts may not result in our return to profitability 
we could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights  which could seriously harm the business 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
although we are not involved in any intellectual property litigation  we may be a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others intellectual property 
claims for alleged infringement and any resulting lawsuit  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights and may require us to stop selling  incorporating or using products that use the challenged intellectual property 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
necessary licenses of third party technology may not be available to us or may be very expensive 
we integrate third party licensed technology in certain of our products 
from time to time we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or product enhancements 
third party licenses may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
our inability to maintain or re license any third party licenses required in our current products or our inability to obtain third party licenses necessary to develop new products and product enhancements  could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost  any of which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is subject to risks from global operations 
we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states and also depend on our contract manufacturers manufacturing operations  which are located within and outside of the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including  among others  political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries  and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
any or all of these factors could adversely impact our business and financial results 

table of contents we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states  we face exposure to adverse movements in non us currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 
the majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in us dollars 
we also have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the japanese yen  hong kong dollar  british pound and the euro  related to our sale and service operations outside of the united states 
an increase in the value of the us dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in us dollars  and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 
currently  we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 
any acquisition we make could disrupt the business and harm our financial condition 
we have made and may continue to make acquisitions and investments in order to enhance our business 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire 
we intend to make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
in the event of any such investments or acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur amortization expenses related to purchases of intangible assets  or incur large and immediate write offs 
we are a party to lawsuits  which  if determined adversely to us  could result in the imposition of damages against us and could harm our business and financial condition 
we and certain of our former officers and current and former members of our board of directors are subject to various lawsuits brought by classes of stockholders alleging  among other things  violations of federal and state securities laws breach of various fiduciary obligations 
there can be no assurance that actions that have been or will be brought against us will be resolved in our favor 
any losses resulting from these claims could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow 
the unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
the factors that may impact the unpredictability of our quarterly results include the reduced visibility into customers spending plans  the changing market conditions  which have resulted in some customer and potential customer bankruptcies  a change in the mix of our products sold  from higher priced core products to lower priced edge products  and long sales and implementation cycle 
as a result  we believe 
table of contents that quarter to quarter comparisons of operating results are not a good indication of future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarters  operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in which case the price of our common stock may fall 
our stock price has been volatile and could decline substantially 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past  will likely continue to fluctuate in the future and may decline 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are variations in our quarter to quarter operating results  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  new or enhanced products or services  acquisitions  distribution partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business  our sale of common stock or other securities in the future  changes in economic and capital market conditions for companies in our sector  changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors  changes in business or regulatory conditions  and the trading volume of our common stock 
we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components 
with the current demand for electronic products  component shortages are possible and the predictability of the availability of such components may be limited 
we currently purchase several key components  including asics  from single or limited sources 
we may not be able to develop an alternate or second source in a timely manner  which could hurt our ability to deliver product to customers 
if we are unable to buy these components on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver product to our customers  which would seriously impact present and future sales  which would  in turn  adversely affect our business 
if we fail to adequately evolve our systems and processes in a changing business environment  our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted 
our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial control and our reporting systems and procedures 
if we fail to continue to evolve our systems and processes  our ability to manage our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted 
our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internet based systems  changes in industry structure could lead to product discontinuances 
a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth of the internet and on the deployment of our product by customers that depend on the continued growth of the internet 
as a result of the economic slowdown and the reduction in capital spending  which have particularly affected telecommunications service providers  spending on internet infrastructure has declined  which has had a material adverse effect on our business 
to the extent that the economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending continue to adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure  we could continue to experience material adverse effects on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we face risks from the uncertainties of regulation of the telecommunications industry as well as the internet and commerce over the internet 
the telecommunications industry is highly regulated and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by the changes in the regulations relating to the telecommunications industry 
also  there are few laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on the internet 
we could be adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate 
such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using internet protocol  encryption technology  and access charges for internet service providers 
the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products  and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating result and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands valuation of securities given an interest valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points bps rate increase of x bps fair value as of issuer bps bps bps december  bps bps bps government treasury and agencies corporate bonds and notes asset backed securities and other total these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps  which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts 
the majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in us dollars 
however  since we have sales and service operations outside of the us  we do have some transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  japanese yen  hong kong dollar  british pound and the australian dollar 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen  british pound and australian dollar 
these derivatives are not designated as hedges under sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at december  
table of contents  the notional and fair values of these contracts were not material 
we do not expect gains and losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our financial results 
we also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses  denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen  british pound and australian dollar 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas at december   the notional and fair values of these contracts were not material 
we do not expect gains and losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our financial results 
these contracts have original maturities ranging from one to three months 
we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign contracts with credit worthy financial institutions
