item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are one of the five largest radio broadcasting companies in the united states based on revenues pro forma for completed and pending acquisitions 
we operate in markets  including boston  seattle  denver  portland  sacramento  kansas city  milwaukee  norfolk  new orleans  buffalo  greensboro  memphis  rochester  greenville spartanburg  wilkes barre scranton  wichita  madison  gainesville ocala and longview kelso wa 
a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
the advertising rates that a radio station is able to charge and the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels largely determine those revenues 
advertising rates are primarily based on three factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  and the supply of and demand for radio advertising time  both nationally and in the regions in which we operate 
in  we generated of our net revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and from net national spot advertising  which is sold by independent advertising sales representatives 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from network compensation  radio station events and rental income from tower sites 
our most significant station operating expenses are employees compensation  and programming and promotional expenses 
we include in our net revenues those net revenues recognized under a time brokerage agreement or a similar sales agreement for stations operated by us prior to acquiring the stations  while we reflect operating expenses associated with these stations in station operating expenses 
consequently  there is no difference in the method of revenue and operating expense recognition between a station operated by us under a time brokerage agreement or similar sales agreement and a station owned and operated by us 
several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
we generally incur advertising and promotional expenses to increase audiences 
any changes in audience listening are reflected quarterly in an arbitron ratings report 
as a result  any changed ratings and any corresponding effect on advertising revenues tend to lag behind the incurrence of advertising and promotional spending 
we calculate same station operating data by comparing the performance of stations operated by us throughout the relevant period to the comparable performance in the prior year s corresponding period 
we include in our same station operating data the effects of changes in status of significant contracts that relate to operations that we account for as a separate business unit 
for the comparison of the years ended december  and  same station operating data was adjusted to reflect the following changes in such significant contracts the termination in of a sports contract with the boston celtics and the termination as of february  of a joint sales agreement with king fm 
for the comparison of the years ended december  and  same station operating data was adjusted to reflect the following changes in such significant contracts the termination in of a sports contract with the boston celtics  the termination in of a sports contract with the seattle seahawks  and the termination in of a sports event with the sacramento pga tournament 
same station broadcast cash flow margin is the broadcast cash flow margin of the stations included in our same station calculations 
recent event s effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets that requires goodwill and certain other intangibles not be amortized 
amortization of costs associated with the acquisition of radio stations has historically been a significant factor in determining our overall profitability 
with the adoption of statement no

results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following results of operations include a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our results of operations represent the operations of the radio stations owned or operated pursuant to time brokerage agreements or joint sales agreements during the relevant periods 
several factors affected our results of operations for the year ended december  that did not affect the prior year 
during the year ended december  we acquired on july  for million two radio stations in denver that we began operating on february  under a time brokerage agreement  that contributed to higher net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  time brokerage fees and lower interest income  we began operating a radio station on february  in denver under a time brokerage agreement that contributed to higher net revenues  station operating expenses and time brokerage fees  we acquired on may  for million a radio station in denver  that on march  we began operating under a time brokerage agreement  that contributed to higher net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  time brokerage fees and lower interest income  we acquired on february  for million two radio stations in greensboro that on december  we began operating under a time brokerage agreement  that contributed to higher net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization and interest expense  we terminated as of february   our joint sales agreement for king fm in seattle  that contributed to lower net revenues and station operating expenses during  we did not renew our rights to broadcast the boston celtics or sell the advertising in these broadcasts under a contract that expired during the second quarter of  that contributed to lower net revenues and lower station operating expenses during  we used a portion of the million in net proceeds from an equity offering for reducing outstanding indebtedness of million under our bank facility s revolver  which resulted in decreased interest expense during  we received net proceeds of million from the offering of our senior subordinated notes which resulted in increased interest expense during  we allowed derivatives designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of million to expire during without entering into new derivatives  which contributed to lower interest expense during  we wrote down our remaining investment in lmiv and incurred additional costs associated with closing the business  that contributed to a higher equity loss from an unconsolidated affiliate  we discontinued the amortization of broadcasting licenses and goodwill effective january   which significantly reduced our amortization expense during  and we extended the period of exercise for stock options issued to certain members of the company s board of directors who retired on may   that contributed to higher non cash compensation costs 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenues net revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million is attributed to our acquisitions of stations in the denver and greensboro markets  net of the termination of contracts for king fm and the boston celtics  and the disposition of a wichita station 
on a same station basis  net revenues increased to million from million 
same station net revenues increased primarily due to an improvement in the advertising sector of the markets we serve and significant revenue market share gains in our markets that resulted in increased sales in most of our markets 
sacramento  kansas city and new orleans contributed most to our overall revenue increases and  to a lesser extent comparison to the prior year that included the events of september  whereby radio advertising was severely curtailed for several days  and comparison to the prior year that included the lingering effects of september by depressing advertising spending into the fourth quarter of last year 
station operating expenses station operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million is attributed to acquisitions of stations in the denver and greensboro markets  net of the termination of contracts for king fm and the boston celtics  and the disposition of a wichita station

depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was mainly attributable to the adoption on january  of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as described more fully in the footnotes to the financial statements under goodwill and intangible assets 
adoption of statement no 
had the impact of eliminating our amortization expense for goodwill and broadcasting licenses 
for comparison purposes  for the year ended december   we recorded amortization expense for goodwill and broadcasting licenses of million and million  respectively 
we also completed the transitional non amortizing intangible asset impairment test for broadcasting licenses and recorded to the statement of operations  a million charge  net of a deferred tax benefit of million  under the cumulative effect of accounting change 
we also completed the transitional assessment of goodwill and determined that the carrying amount of each of our markets did not exceed the fair value 
since the carrying amount of each market did not exceed the fair value under the transitional assessment  we did not need to perform the second step of the transitional impairment test and  accordingly  we did not record a goodwill impairment charge in corporate general and administrative expenses corporate general and administrative expenses  which includes non cash compensation expense  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  exclusive of non cash compensation expense  corporate general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to inflation  the addition of several new staff positions and the costs associated with an increase in the number of stations owned or operated during this year as compared to the prior year  partially offset by cost containment measures 
non cash compensation expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in non cash compensation expense was primarily due to the recognition of million in non cash compensation expense from the may  modification of option grants for retiring members of our board of directors 
interest expense interest expense  including the financing cost of our convertible preferred securities  term income deferrable equity securities tides  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was mainly attributable to the expiration at various times during the year ended december  of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of million that effectively fixed our variable rate debt between and  a reduction of million in our outstanding indebtedness as of march  from a portion of the cash proceeds from our equity offering  and an overall reduction in interest rates from the prior year  offset by the increase in interest expense from the million senior subordinated notes issued on march  income before income taxes and accounting changes income before income taxes and accounting changes increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in the income before income taxes and accounting changes is mainly attributable to the impact of eliminating this year our amortization expense for goodwill and broadcasting licenses of million in  the increase in net revenues  net of the increase in station operating expenses as a result of the factors described above under net revenues and station operating expenses  and a reduction in interest expense as a result of the factors described above under interest expense  offset by an increase in net expense from time brokerage agreement fees 
net income loss we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the net loss is mainly attributable to a million impairment charge  net of a deferred tax benefit of million  under the cumulative effect of accounting change as an accumulated transition adjustment attributable to the adoption on january  of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which was offset by a million increase in income before accounting changes  for the reasons described above  net of taxes

liquidity and capital resources historically  we have used a significant portion of our capital resources to reduce outstanding debt and to consummate acquisitions 
generally  these acquisitions are funded from one or a combination of the following sources our bank facility described below  the sale of our securities  the swapping of our radio stations in transactions which qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code  and internally generated cash flow 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

on a continuing basis  credit rating agencies such as moody s investor services and standard and poor s evaluate our debt 
as a result of their review  our credit rating could change 
management believes that any significant downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact on our future liquidity 
the effect of a change in the credit rating includes  but is not limited to  interest rate changes under any future bank facilities  debentures  notes or other types of debt

in order to finance future acquisitions  if any  however  we may require additional financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us

our capital expenditures totaled million in the year ended december   as compared to million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures increased only marginally for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year

the estimate for includes capital expenditures to be incurred in connection with the relocation and or expansion of several markets studio facilities and those costs associated with upgrading certain of our facilities to incorporate the new technology to permit digital radio broadcasting

additionally  we may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing from time to time 
our bank facility requires that at the time of closing on these transactions  we must be in compliance with the terms of the bank facility 
we believe that we will maintain compliance with the terms of our bank facility 
if we are not in compliance  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in amending or entering into a new bank facility  obtaining additional financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us  which could delay or impair our efforts to consummate the pending transactions

under the bank facility  the reducing revolving credit facility and the multi draw term loan mature on september  and reduce on a quarterly basis beginning september  in amounts that vary from million to million for each loan

in april  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of statements no 
  and  amendment of statement no 
 and technical corrections 
statement no 
rescinds statement no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and an amendment of that statement  statement no 
 extinguishments of debt to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
statement no 
also rescinds statement no 
 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers 
statement no 
amends statement no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
statement no 
also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
in the past  we have reflected losses from extinguishments of debt as extraordinary items 
under statement no 
 debt extinguishments are often routine  recurring transactions and in most circumstances would require treatment other than as an extraordinary item 
adoption of statement no 
by us will be effective on january  and any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in accounting principles board opinion no 
for classification as an extraordinary item shall be reclassified 
we do not believe that the adoption of statement no 
will materially impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
statement no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and improves financial reporting by requiring that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
adoption of statement no 
by us will be effective on january  and will not be retroactive to prior years 
we do not believe that the adoption of statement no 
will materially impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting series interpretation no 
entitled guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which provides for an interpretation of financial accounting standards board statements no 
  and and rescission of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
this interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
adoption of this interpretation by us will be effective on january  and will be applied prospectively to all guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not believe that the adoption of interpretation no 
will materially impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  that amends statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
statement no 
also amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
adoption of statement no 
by us will be effective on january  we currently account for stock based compensation plans under accounting principles board no 
for employees and under statement no 
for non employees 
we do not believe that the adoption of statement no 
will materially impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations as we do not anticipate changing our method to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under statement no 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the amount of reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or by using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be important in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make payments 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances may be required 
radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
as of december   we had recorded billion in radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets  which represented of our total assets 
effective january   the company adopted the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  that requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets will not be amortized 
instead  these assets will be reviewed at least annually for impairment and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
the fair value of these assets is dependent on the performance of our stations 
in assessing the recoverability of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we must conduct annual impairment testing required by statement no 
 which could result in our being required to write down the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill in future periods 
we completed the transitional non amortizing intangible asset impairment test for broadcasting licenses and recorded to the statement of operations  a million impairment charge  net of a deferred tax benefit of million  under the cumulative effect of accounting change for the year ended december  we also completed the transitional assessment of goodwill and determined that the carrying amount for each of our markets did not exceed the fair value 
since the carrying amount of each market did not exceed the fair value under the transitional assessment  we did not need to perform the second step of the transitional impairment test and accordingly  we did not record a goodwill impairment charge in as of december   we had recorded billion in indefinite lived intangible assets  which represented approximately of our total assets 
contingencies and litigation on an on going basis  we evaluate our exposure related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
estimation of effective tax rates we evaluate our effective tax rates regularly and adjust rates when appropriate based on currently available information relative to statutory rates  apportionment factors and the applicable taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  among other factors 
certain of our deferred tax assets are comprised of loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax filing purposes for which recovery is dependent on the amount and timing of taxable income we ultimately generate in the future  as well as other factors 
we could recognize no benefit from our deferred tax assets or we could recognize the maximum benefit that is in accordance with our current estimate 
also  tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
we believe our estimate of the value of our tax contingencies is a critical accounting estimate as it contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for radio station operating expenses  including wages  and equipment 
the exact impact is indeterminable 
risk factors many statements contained in this report are forward looking in nature 
these statements are based on current plans  intentions or expectations and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans  intentions or expectations 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ are the following we face many unpredictable business risks  both general and specific to the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
our future operations are subject to many business risks  including those risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our business including economic conditions  both generally and relative to the radio broadcasting industry  shifts in population  demographics or audience tastes  the level of competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations  satellite radio  television stations and other entertainment and communications media  technological changes and innovations  new laws  including proposals to eliminate the tax deductibility of certain expenses incurred by advertisers  and changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the department of justice  the federal trade commission and the fcc 
given the inherent unpredictability of these variables  we cannot with any degree of certainty predict what effect  if any  these variables will have on our future operations 
generally  advertising tends to decline during economic recession or downturn 
consequently  our advertising revenue is likely to be adversely affected by a recession or downturn in the united states economy  the economy of an individual geographic market in which we own or operate radio stations  or other events or circumstances that adversely affect advertising activity 
our radio stations may not be able to compete effectively in their respective markets for advertising revenues 
our radio broadcasting stations are in a highly competitive business 
our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues within their respective markets directly with other radio stations  as well as with other media  such as newspapers  magazines  network and cable television  outdoor advertising and direct mail 
audience ratings and market shares are subject to change  and any change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our stations located in that market 
while we already compete in some of our markets with other stations with similar programming formats  if another radio station in a market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to one of our stations  if a new station were to adopt a comparable format or if an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations  our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and or advertising revenue and could incur increased promotional and other expenses 
other radio broadcasting companies may enter into the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
we cannot assure you that any of our stations will be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues 
we are dependent on federally issued licenses to operate our radio stations and are subject to extensive federal regulation 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act 
we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our radio stations 
licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable 
although the vast majority of fcc radio station licenses are routinely renewed  we cannot assure you that the fcc will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must comply with extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
for example  in connection with the sinclair kansas city acquisition we were required to dispose of three radio stations in kansas city 
the fcc s rules governing our radio station operations impose costs on our operations  and changes in those rules could have an adverse effect on our business 
the fcc also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations 
if the fcc relaxes these technical requirements  it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  these fcc regulations and others may change over time and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us 
we may not be successful in identifying and consummating future acquisitions  which is an important element of our business strategy 
we pursue growth  in part  through the acquisition of individual radio stations and groups of radio stations 
our consummation of all future acquisitions will be subject to various conditions  including fcc and other regulatory approvals 
the fcc must approve any transfer of control or assignment of broadcast licenses 
in addition  acquisitions may encounter intense scrutiny under federal and state antitrust laws 
our future acquisitions may be subject to notification under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of and to a waiting period and possible review by the department of justice and the federal trade commission 
any delays  injunctions  conditions or modifications by any of these federal agencies could have a negative effect on us and result in the abandonment of all or part of attractive acquisition opportunities 
as a result  under certain circumstances  all or a partial amount of our escrow deposits of million  made in connection with the pending acquisitions  could be forfeited if we are unable to timely consummate all or any of our pending acquisitions 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in identifying future acquisition opportunities or what the consequences will be of any acquisitions 
depending on the nature  size and timing of future acquisitions  we may require additional financing 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
radio broadcasting is a rapidly consolidating industry  with many companies seeking to consummate acquisitions and increase their market share 
in this environment  we compete and will continue to compete with many other buyers for the acquisition of radio stations 
some of those competitors may be able to outbid us for acquisitions because they have greater financial resources 
as a result of these and other factors  our ability to identify and consummate future acquisitions is uncertain 
we may be unable to effectively integrate our acquisitions 
the integration of acquisitions involves numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of operations and systems and the management of a large and geographically diverse group of stations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key employees of acquired stations  and the risk of integration is higher during a period of significant or rapid growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate successfully any operations  systems or management that might be acquired in the future 
in addition  in the event that the operations of a new business do not meet expectations  we may restructure or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the new business 
we have substantial indebtedness that could have important consequences to you 
we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders equity 
at december   we had long term indebtedness of million excluding outstanding letters of credit of million and shareholders equity of million 
in addition to our obligations on our long term indebtedness  we have quarterly interest obligations on the debentures held by the trust that fund distributions on the convertible preferred securities  term income deferrable equity securities tides 
these obligations are substantial in amount and could have an impact on you 
for example  these obligations could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes  including funding future expansion and ongoing capital expenditures  impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  limit our ability to compete  expand and make capital improvements  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and limit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions 
as of december   million was available under our million current bank facility  subject to compliance with the covenants under the bank facility at the time of borrowing and subject to quarterly debt reduction commitments 
moreover  under certain circumstances  we may need to modify or enter into a new bank facility to close on our pending or future acquisitions 
we also may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing for any of the following transactions the acquisition of radio stations  the full or partial redemption of our outstanding debt or convertible instruments and or the payment of a dividend  and or the buyback of our class a common stock 
we have no assurances that we will be able to obtain other funding  additional financing or the approvals  if necessary  for any of these transactions 
any additional borrowings would further increase the amount of our indebtedness and the associated risks 
the covenants in our credit facility and our senior subordinated notes restrict our financial and operational flexibility 
our credit facility and our senior subordinated notes contain covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  swap or sell assets  or merge or consolidate 
an event of default under our bank facility or our senior subordinated notes could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
we have pledged substantially all of our consolidated assets and the stock of our subsidiaries to secure the debt under our credit facility 
if the amounts outstanding under the credit facility were accelerated  the lenders could proceed against our consolidated assets and the stock of our subsidiaries 
if the amounts outstanding under the senior subordinated notes were accelerated  the lenders could proceed against the stock of our subsidiaries 
a default under our senior subordinated notes could cause a default under our credit facility 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our bank facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by operating performance or other events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those ratios 
we also may incur future debt obligations in connection with future acquisitions that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility or subject us to other events of default 
the debt we expect to incur in connection with future acquisitions may require us to modify or enter into a new bank facility if certain covenants in our current bank facility would be violated  subjecting us to an event of default 
because of our holding company structure  we depend on our subsidiaries for cash flow  and our access to this cash flow is restricted 
we operate as a holding company 
all of our radio stations are currently owned and operated by our subsidiaries 
entercom radio  llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  is the borrower under our credit facility and our senior subordinated debt 
all of our station operating subsidiaries are subsidiaries of entercom radio  llc 
further  we guaranteed entercom radio  llc s obligations under the credit facility on a senior secured basis and under the senior subordinated notes on an unsecured basis  junior to our credit facility 
our obligations on the convertible preferred securities  which were purchased by the trust that sells the convertible preferred securities  term income deferrable equity securities tides  are subordinated to our obligations on the credit facility and on the senior subordinated notes 
as a holding company  our only source of cash to pay our obligations  including corporate overhead and other trade payables  are distributions from our subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flow 
we currently expect that the net earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations  including servicing their debt obligations  before distributions are made to us 
even if our subsidiaries elect to make distributions to us  we cannot assure you that applicable state law and contractual restrictions  including the dividend covenants contained in our credit facility and senior subordinated notes  would permit such dividends or distributions 
our chairman of the board and our president and chief executive officer effectively control our company  and members of his immediate family also own a substantial equity interest in us 
their interests may conflict with yours 
as of february   joseph m 
field  our chairman of the board  beneficially owns  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our class b common stock  representing approximately of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock 
as of february   david j 
field  our president  chief executive officer  one of our directors and the son of joseph m 
field  beneficially owns  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our outstanding class b common stock  representing approximately of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock 
collectively  joseph m 
field and david j 
field and other members of the field family beneficially own all of our outstanding class b common stock 
other members of the field family also own shares of class a common stock 
shares of class b common stock are transferable only to joseph m 
field  david j 
field  certain of their family members or trusts for any of their benefit 
upon any other transfer  shares of our class b common stock convert automatically into shares of our class a common stock on a share for share basis 
shares of our class b common stock are entitled to ten votes only when they are voted by joseph m 
field or david j 
field  subject to certain exceptions where they are restricted to one vote 
joseph m 
field generally is able to control the vote on all matters submitted to the vote of shareholders and  therefore  is able to direct our management and policies  except with respect to those matters where the shares of our class b common stock are only entitled to one vote and those matters requiring a class vote under the provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws or applicable law  including  without limitation  the election of the two class a directors 
without the approval of joseph m 
field  we will be unable to consummate transactions involving an actual or potential change of control  including transactions in which investors might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over then current market prices 
we depend on selected market clusters of radio stations 
for the year ended december   we generated almost of our net revenues in of our markets seattle  boston  kansas city and sacramento 
accordingly we may have greater exposure to adverse events or conditions that affect the economy in any of these markets that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we must respond to the rapid changes in technology  services and standards that characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
several new media technologies and services are being developed or introduced  including the following satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which has resulted in the introduction of new subscriber based satellite radio services with numerous niche formats  audio programming by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  personal communications systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  in band on channel digital radio  which provides multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  and low power fm radio  which could result in additional fm radio broadcast outlets 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that competition arising from new technologies or regulatory change may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on the financial condition and results of operations of our company 
our stock price could be volatile and could drop unexpectedly 
our class a common stock has been publicly traded since january  the market price of our class a common stock has been subject to fluctuations since the date of our initial public offering 
the stock market has from time to time experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could materially decline  regardless of our operating performance 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key executives 
we believe that the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
you will have no recourse against one of the experts named in this document 
arthur andersen llp is unable to consent to the use of their independent public accountants report with respect to the consolidated financial statements as of december  and for the year ended december   which financial statements have been incorporated by reference in this document 
this means that arthur andersen llp is not reconfirming the continuing validity of its audit opinion on these financial statements 
although we have no reason to believe that those financial statements are incorrect  if they are incorrect and we are adversely affected as a result  you will not be able to recover any damages you may incur from arthur andersen llp 
we are subject to general changes in the economy that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
any adverse change in the us economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and on the future price of our class a common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under certain bank facility covenants that are measured periodically  we may be required from time to time to protect ourselves from interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative rate hedging instruments 
as a result  we have entered into various interest rate transactions with various banks  which we call the rate hedging transactions designed to mitigate our exposure to significantly higher floating interest rates 
these rate hedging transactions are referred to as a collar or a swap 
a collar consists of a rate cap agreement that establishes an upper limit or cap for the base libor rate and a rate floor agreement that establishes a lower limit or floor for the base libor rate 
collar agreements covering a rate cap and a rate floor have been entered into simultaneously with the same bank 
swap agreements require that we pay a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount to a bank and the bank pay to us a variable rate equal to three month libor 
as of december   we have rate hedging transactions in place for a total notional amount of million 
the fair value of the rate hedging transactions at december   based upon current market rates  is included as derivative instruments in current liabilities and other long term liabilities according to the respective maturity date of the instrument 
based upon the variable rate debt  including any outstanding derivative rate hedging instruments  as of december   a basis point change in interest rates would change annual interest expense by approximately million 
we do not have significant interest rate risk related to our senior subordinated notes and our convertible preferred securities  term income deferrable equity securities tides  which have fixed interest rates of and  respectively 
our credit exposure under these agreements is limited to the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party 
to minimize this risk  we select high credit quality counter parties 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by such counter parties  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counter parties nonperformance 
all of the rate hedging transactions are tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the valuation for each of these rate hedging transactions is affected by the change in the three month libor rate and the forward interest rate to maturity 
any increase in the three month libor rate or the forward interest rate to maturity results in a more favorable valuation  while any decrease in the three month libor rate or forward interest rate to maturity results in a less favorable valuation for each of the rate hedging transactions 
the three month libor rate and the forward interest rate to maturity at december  were lower as compared to the rate at december  the increase in market value liability of the instruments as of december   was due primarily to a reduction in the forward interest rate to maturity for each of the transactions and a decrease in libor rates  offset by the expiration of million in rate hedging transactions 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
entitled accounting for derivative and hedging activities  that was amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  which are collectively referred to as derivatives and hedging activities 
the effect of the adoption of this accounting standard was reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and
