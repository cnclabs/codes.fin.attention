overview cabot microelectronics corporation cabot microelectronics  the company  us  we  or our is the leading supplier of high performance polishing slurries used in the manufacture of the most advanced integrated circuit ic devices within the semiconductor industry  in a process called chemical mechanical planarization cmp 
cmp is a polishing process used by ic device manufacturers to planarize or flatten many of the multiple layers of material that are built upon silicon wafers  and is a necessary step in the production of advanced ics 
planarization is a polishing process that uses cmp slurries and pads to level  smooth and remove excess material from the surfaces of these layers 
cmp slurries are liquid formulations that facilitate and enhance this polishing process and generally contain engineered abrasives and proprietary chemicals 
cmp pads are typically flat engineered disks made of polymeric materials that help to distribute and transport the slurry to the surface of the wafer and distribute it across the wafer 
cmp enables ic device manufacturers to produce smaller  faster and more complex ic devices with fewer defects 
we believe cmp will become increasingly important in the future as manufacturers continue to shrink the size of these devices and to improve their performance 
our cmp products are used for a number of applications  such as polishing insulating layers  the tungsten plugs that go through the insulating layers and connect the multiple wiring layers of ic devices  and copper wiring 
in addition  we have developed and sell cmp slurries for polishing certain components in hard disk drives  specifically rigid disk substrates and magnetic heads  and we believe we are one of the leading suppliers in this area 
we are continuing to develop slurries for new applications such as direct shallow trench isolation  used to electrically isolate adjoining transistors 
in addition  we operate as a value added reseller of polishing pads and are developing our own polishing pads for use in the cmp process 
prior to our initial public offering in april  we operated as a division of cabot corporation cabot corporation  a global chemical manufacturing company based in boston  massachusetts 
following our initial public offering  cabot corporation owned approximately percent of cabot microelectronics 
in september  cabot corporation effected the spin off of cabot microelectronics by distributing shares of our common stock as a dividend on each outstanding share of cabot corporation common stock outstanding on september   or an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
basis of presentation the following management s discussion of results of operations contains financial comparisons with prior periods that are affected by certain agreements entered into with cabot corporation during the fiscal year ended september  the effects of these agreements on the comparison of operating results are disclosed in the discussion that follows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventory valuation  impairments of tangible and intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  other accruals  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we maintain a warranty reserve which provides for the estimated cost of product returns based upon historical experience and any known conditions or circumstances 
our warranty obligation is affected primarily by product that does not meet specifications and performance requirements and any related costs of addressing such matters 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and write down the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
an inventory reserve is maintained based upon a historical percentage of actual inventory written off and for known conditions and circumstances 
should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from those projected by management  revisions to the estimated inventory reserve may be required 
also  the purchase cost of one of our key raw materials from one supplier changes significantly based on the total quantity of in specification product purchased in a given fiscal year 
during interim periods we determine inventory valuation and the amount charged to cost of goods sold for this raw material from this supplier based on the expected average cost over the entire fiscal year using our current full year forecast of purchases of this raw material from this supplier 
we have entered into unconditional purchase obligations  which include noncancelable purchase commitments and take or pay arrangements with suppliers 
we review our agreements and make an assessment of the likelihood of a shortfall in purchases and determine if it is necessary to record a liability 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas and no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we have elected to account for stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
we disclose the summary of pro forma effects to reported net income as if we had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of stock based awards to employees of cabot microelectronics as prescribed by sfas results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue of certain line items included in our historical statements of income year ended september  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit research and development selling and marketing general and administrative litigation settlement amortization of intangibles operating income other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended september  versus year ended september  revenue total revenue was million in  which represented a  or million  increase from of this increase  million was due to a increase in volume and million was due to increased weighted average selling prices driven by improved sales mix 
revenue related to copper products increased over the prior year 
fiscal revenue would have been million lower had the japanese yen average exchange rate for the year held constant with the prior year average 
also  in june  we began selling directly to customers in europe  singapore and malaysia 
these customers previously had been serviced through metron  a third party distributor 
during this transition period we discontinued sales to metron while they drew down their inventory of our products  which we believe resulted in an adverse revenue impact of million during our third quarter of fiscal we did not see a significant improvement in demand driven by our customers end markets in fiscal year  as a lack of corporate information technology spending appears to have weighed heavily on the pc and computer related markets 
we also experienced continued competition and pricing pressure this fiscal year and expect these factors to continue 
as we begin our fiscal year  we see some encouraging signs in the semiconductor industry 
overall semiconductor sales appear to be on an upward trend  with growth in the leading technologies even more pronounced 
although overall semiconductor sales appear to be on an upward trend  the continued uncertainty in the semiconductor industry and the worldwide economy make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends 
cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in  which represented an increase of or million from of this increase  million was due to higher sales volume  million was due to higher average costs per gallon associated with meeting our customers more stringent product quality requirements and million was due to a charge related to the remaining minimum purchase obligation of a raw material supply agreement for a polishing pad technology that was previously under development but is no longer being pursued 
our total cost of this supply agreement was million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
we do not expect to incur any additional costs with respect to this agreement 
the increase in cost of goods sold were partially offset by the absence of the rippey royalty payments which ended in august  following the expiration of a contingent payment arrangement with rippey resulting from our acquisition of selected assets used or created in connection with the development and sale of polishing slurries 
we had made payments under this agreement of of applicable slurry revenue from july through our last payment in august with respect to the key raw materials used to make our products  we expect that the cost of fumed silica we purchase from cabot corporation used in the manufacture of cmp slurries will continue to increase according to the terms of our existing fumed metal oxide agreement with cabot corporation  which provides for a fixed annual increase in the price of silica of of the initial price and additional price adjustments corresponding to cabot corporation s raw material cost increases or decreases 
also  under the fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation  the overall price of fumed alumina fluctuates since it is based on all of cabot corporation s fixed and variable costs for producing the fumed alumina  plus its capital costs for expanding its capacity  plus an agreed upon rate of return on investment  plus incentive payments if more than a certain amount of fumed alumina per year is produced that meets our specifications 
our need for additional quantities of key raw materials in the future has required and will continue to require that we enter into new supply arrangements with third parties 
we may enter into arrangements in the future that could result in costs which are higher than those in the existing agreements 
we also expect to continue to invest in our operations excellence initiative to improve our manufacturing capabilities to meet our customers increasing product performance requirements 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was in as compared to in the decrease in gross profit resulted primarily from an increase in manufacturing costs to support our customers increasing quality requirements  pricing pressure from certain key customers and our recognition of the minimum purchase obligation referred to above 
in the near term  we expect gross profit will be in the range  plus or minus  as we continue to add staffing and make improvements in manufacturing processes 
research and development total research and development expenses were million in  which represented an increase of or million  from research and development expense increased million due to increased staffing  million due to higher wafer purchases and million due to depreciation and operating costs of our r d facility and other new equipment 
since the r d facility was opened during the prior fiscal year  does not represent a full year of depreciation and operating costs related to the facility 
an additional million increase resulted from allocating certain common facility operating costs to r d 
these costs had previously been treated as general and administrative expense prior to the r d facility construction 
additional costs were incurred in technical service support and other areas to support the overall increase in r d activities 
r d efforts were mainly related to new and enhanced cmp products including slurry products for copper applications  new cmp polishing pad technology and advanced chemistry and particle technology 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  over the increase resulted primarily from higher staffing costs associated with our increased customer support initiatives including our transition to selling direct to customers in europe  singapore and malaysia  rather than through a distributor 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from increases include depreciation of our business information systems  higher directors and officers liability insurance premiums of million and increased staffing costs of million 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in legal and professional expenses  primarily due to the absence of legal fees associated with the rodel litigation  discussed further below  a decrease in facilities charges due to the change in allocation of certain common facility operating costs described under research and development and the absence of a million non cash charge related to the modification of a former director s stock option agreement in fiscal litigation settlement during the second fiscal quarter of  we settled all pending patent infringement litigation with rodel  which resulted in a one time payment of million 
under the settlement agreement  we received a fully paid up  worldwide royalty free license to all technology that was the subject of the litigation and their foreign equivalents  and we have no further financial obligation with respect to this matter 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was million in and other income  net other expense was negligible in compared to million of other income in the decrease in other income in is due to the absence of foreign exchange gains recorded in the prior year resulting from the strengthening of the japanese yen  which were partially offset by a payment made to cabot corporation in as reimbursement for certain capital improvements made to equipment used to supply us with raw materials  which is no longer in service 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to an increase in tax credits from expanded research and experimentation activities 
net income net income was million in  which represented a decrease of  or million  from as a result of the factors discussed above 
year ended september  versus year ended september  revenue total revenue was million in  which represented a  or million  increase from of this increase  million was due to a increase in volume and million was due to increased weighted average selling prices 
revenue related to copper products increased over the prior year 
fiscal revenue would have been million higher had the japanese yen average exchange rate for the year held constant with the prior year average 
total revenue in the second half of fiscal increased over the first half of the year 
we believe this was primarily due to higher production by our customers as a result of improvement in ic device inventories  which appeared to return to more normal levels during cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in  which represented an increase of or million from of this increase  million was due to higher sales volume and million was due to higher weighted average costs per gallon 
the cost of fumed silica we purchase from cabot corporation increased according to the terms of our existing fumed metal oxide agreement with cabot corporation  which provides for a fixed annual increase in the price of silica of of the initial price and additional increases based upon an increase in cabot corporation s raw material costs 
in order to meet certain of our needs for fumed alumina given the anticipated growth in sales of fumed alumina based slurries  in december  we entered into a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation and an amendment to the fumed metal oxide agreement with respect to its fumed alumina terms 
the terms of this agreement  along with those contained in the amendment to the fumed metal oxide agreement  were retroactive to october and our average cost per pound for alumina from cabot corporation since that time is higher than paid previously under the original fumed metal oxide agreement 
had we paid this higher average cost per pound for all fumed alumina purchased in fiscal  cost of goods sold in that period would have increased by approximately million 
during fiscal  certain costs decreased following the final payment in august associated with the expiration of a contingent payment arrangement with rippey resulting from our acquisition of selected assets used or created in connection with the development and sale of polishing slurries 
we had made payments under this agreement of of applicable slurry revenue from july through our last payment in august gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was in as compared to in the decrease in gross profit resulted primarily from an increase in fixed manufacturing costs offset partially by an increase in weighted average selling prices 
research and development total research and development expenses were million in  which represented an increase of or million  from research and development expense increased million due to increased staffing  million due to higher wafer purchases and million due to depreciation and operating costs of our new r d facility  which opened in april an additional million increase resulted from allocating certain common facility operating costs to r d 
these costs had previously been treated as general and administrative expense prior to the r d facility addition to our existing office building 
key activities during the year involved the continued development of new and enhanced cmp products  with a significant focus on slurries for polishing copper  and new cmp polishing pad technology 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  over the increase was primarily due to increased staffing in north america 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  which represented a decrease of  or million  from the decrease was primarily due to the absence of million of stock compensation and other costs associated with an executive leaving the business in fiscal  a net decrease in non cash charges related to modifications of stock option agreements of million  reduced relocation and recruiting costs of million  decrease in professional fees of million  decrease in facilities charges of million due to the change in allocation of certain common facility operating costs described under research and development and a net decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts of million 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase in depreciation of million associated with administrative areas of the r d facility addition 
litigation settlement during the second fiscal quarter of  we settled all pending patent infringement litigation with rodel  which resulted in a one time payment of million 
under the settlement agreement  we received a fully paid up  worldwide royalty free license to all technology that was the subject of the litigation and their foreign equivalents  and we have no further financial obligation with respect to this matter 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was million in compared to million in the reduction of approximately million occurred as we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective october   which required the amortization of goodwill to be discontinued and that goodwill be instead tested for impairment at least annually 
other income  net other income was million in  compared to million in the decrease of approximately million was primarily due to million of interest expense from capital leases entered into during fiscal  a payment of million to cabot corporation in reimbursement for certain capital improvements made to equipment used to supply us with material that is no longer in use  and the absence of million interest income on accounts receivable balances 
these decreases were almost entirely offset by unrealized foreign exchange gains resulting from the strengthening of the japanese yen and increased interest income due to higher cash balances over the prior year 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate was mainly due to an increase in tax credits from expanded research and experimentation activities 
net income net income was million in  which represented a decrease of  or million  from as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash flows from operating activities of million in  million in and million in our cash provided by operating activities in originated from net income from operations of million and non cash items of million  which were partially offset by a net increase in working capital of million 
working capital increased primarily in customer receivables due to higher sales levels  our transition from a distributor to selling direct in europe  singapore and malaysia  extension of payment terms to a limited number of customers and also due to a stronger japanese yen 
inventory also increased to support the higher level of sales and income taxes shifted from a payable to a refundable position driven mainly by research and experimentation tax credits 
our principal funding requirements have been for additions to property  plant and equipment that support the expansion of our business and technological capability 
in cash flows used in investing activities were million  primarily due to million in purchases of additional production related equipment  establishment of mm polishing capability and for metrology tools to support increased polishing capacity in our class clean room 
these capital expenditures were partially offset by million in cash received from the sale of assets  of which million related to the january sale of our distribution center and land in ansung  south korea  which is described more fully below 
in  cash flows used in investing activities were million  primarily due to the construction and completion of our new research and development facility in aurora  illinois  and equipping the facility with additional research and development equipment 
we also purchased additional production related equipment to be used in aurora  illinois and invested in the development and implementation of our business information system 
in  cash flows used in investing activities were million  primarily related to the capacity expansion of our geino  japan facility and construction of our new aurora  illinois research and development facility 
we had cash flows from financing activities of million in which resulted from the issuance of common stock of million for the exercise of stock options and to a much lesser extent  the employee stock purchase plan  offset by a million loan repayment  which is described below  and principal payments of million made under capital lease obligations 
we had cash flows from financing activities of million in which resulted from the issuance of common stock of million for both the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  offset partially by principal payments of million made under capital lease obligations 
in cash flows from financing activities of million resulted from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
in february  we prepaid the entire million unsecured term loan that had been funded on the basis of the illinois state treasurer s economic program which had been due in april and had incurred interest at an annual rate of 
no gain or loss was recognized with respect to the prepayment 
as a result of this prepayment  we have no outstanding long term debt 
in july we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility with a group of commercial banks and in february and august  this agreement was amended with no material changes in terms 
on november   the existing agreement was terminated and replaced with an amended and restated unsecured revolving credit facility of million with an option to increase the facility by up to million 
under this agreement  which terminates in november  but can be renewed for two one year terms  interest accrues on any outstanding balance at either the institution s base rate or the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin 
a non use fee also accrues 
loans under this facility are anticipated to be used primarily for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
the credit agreement also contains various covenants 
no amounts are currently outstanding under this credit facility and we believe we are currently in compliance with the covenants 
we estimate that our total capital expenditures in fiscal year will be approximately million  approximately million of which we have already spent as of october  our major capital expenditures in are currently expected to be approximately million to equip a cleanroom in the asia pacific region  approximately million for advanced clean room equipment  polishing and other equipment primarily for use in our aurora  il research and development facility  and approximately million for general expansion of operations 
as our business needs in south korea have changed  in november we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with a third party to sell our distribution center and land in ansung  south korea 
the sale was completed in january  and the final proceeds approximated the net book value of the assets sold 
we believe that cash generated by our operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and expected capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
however  we plan to expand our business and continue to improve our technology and  to do so  we may be required to raise additional funds in the future through public or private equity  debt financing or other arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements at september  and  we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at september  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
contractual obligations less than after total year years years years in millions long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations capital lease obligations in december we entered into a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation 
under this agreement  cabot corporation expanded its capacity in tuscola  illinois for the manufacture of fumed alumina 
payments by us with respect to capital costs for the facility have been treated as a capital lease for accounting purposes and the present value of the minimum quarterly payments of approximately million resulted in a million lease obligation and million related leased asset 
the agreement has an initial five year term  which expires in  but we can choose to renew the agreement for another five year term  which would expire in we also can choose to not renew the agreement subject to certain terms and conditions and the payment of certain costs  after the initial five year term 
in january we entered into a cmp tool and polishing consumables transfer agreement with a third party under which we agreed to transfer polishing consumables to them in return for a cmp polishing tool 
the polishing tool has been treated as a capital lease and the aggregate fair market value of the polishing consumables resulted in a million lease obligation 
the term of the agreement is approximately three years  expiring in november operating leases we lease certain vehicles  warehouse facilities  office space  machinery and equipment under cancelable and noncancelable operating leases  most of which expire within ten years and may be renewed by us 
purchase obligations purchase obligations include our take or pay arrangements with suppliers  and purchase orders and other obligations entered into in the normal course of business regarding the purchase of goods and services 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million liability for a raw material supply agreement for a polishing pad technology that was previously under development  but is no longer being pursued 
our total obligation with respect to this agreement is million  of which million is recorded in current liabilities and shown in the preceding table under purchase obligations and million is included in other long term liabilities  which is discussed below 
we operate under an amended fumed metal oxide agreement with cabot corporation for the purchase of two key raw materials  fumed silica and fumed alumina 
we are obligated to purchase at least of our six month volume forecast of fumed silica from cabot corporation and must pay for the shortfall if we purchase less than that amount 
we currently anticipate meeting minimum forecasted purchase volume requirements 
also  under our fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation we are obligated to pay certain fixed  capital and variable costs through december this agreement has an initial five year term  but we can choose to renew the agreement for another five year term  which would expire in december if we do not renew the agreement  we will become subject to certain terms and conditions and the payment of certain costs 
purchase obligations include million of contractual commitments based upon our anticipated renewal of the agreement through december we have an agreement with a toll manufacturer pursuant to which the manufacturer performs certain agreed upon dispersion services 
we have agreed to purchase minimum amounts of services per year and to invest approximately million per year in capital improvements or other expenditures to maintain capacity at the manufacturer s dispersion facility 
the initial term of the agreement expires in october  with automatic one year renewals  and contains a day cancellation clause executable by either party 
we are obligated to make a termination payment if the agreement is not renewed 
purchase obligations include million of contractual commitments related to this agreement 
we have a distribution agreement with an existing supplier of polishing pads to the semiconductor industry pursuant to which the supplier sells product to us for our resale to end users 
the initial term of the contract runs through september and we are required to make certain agreed upon purchases in order to maintain the agreement 
included in purchase obligations is million for product which we are required and intend to purchase by september we currently anticipate meeting minimum forecasted purchase requirements for periods subsequent to september we have the ability to cancel the agreement at any time with no cancellation fee 
in june we entered into a technology licensing and co marketing agreement with a semiconductor equipment manufacturer under which we plan to develop  manufacture and sell polishing pads utilizing endpoint detection window technology licensed from the manufacturer for use on the manufacturer s equipment 
under this agreement  we are obligated to pay million for the purchase of capital equipment  approximately one year of certain marketing and technical support services  and equipment services 
as of september   we have paid million of this balance 
in addition  we are obligated to supply this manufacturer with free polishing pads  up to an agreed upon dollar amount  for particular uses over a seven year period 
we currently estimate our total cost associated with these products will be million over the remaining period 
we are also obligated to supply the equipment manufacturer with polishing pads  up to an agreed upon dollar amount over the seven year period  which the manufacturer will purchase from us at our cost 
we will also pay a royalty to the equipment manufacturer and  in certain circumstances  to another party to whom we are a sub licensee under our agreement  based upon net revenue earned with respect to commercial sales of polishing pads covered under the agreement 
the agreement s term lasts as long as the patents on the technology subject to the license agreement remain valid and enforceable 
other long term liabilities other long term liabilities include the million long term portion of the million total purchase obligation discussed above  that we recorded for a raw material supply agreement for a polishing pad technology that was previously under development  but is no longer being pursued 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas which applies to contracts entered into or modified after june  sfas amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas which improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
examples of such financial instruments include mandatorily redeemable shares  put options and forward purchase contracts that may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and obligations that can be settled with shares 
we have not issued these types of financial instruments 
non audit services performed by external auditors pursuant to section a i of the securities exchange act of  as added by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are responsible for disclosing to investors the non audit services approved by our audit committee to be performed by pricewaterhousecoopers llp  our external auditor 
non audit services are defined in the law as services other than those provided in connection with an audit or a review of the financial statements of the company 
during the period covered by this filing our audit committee preapproved the following non audit services  which subsequently were or are being performed by pricewaterhousecoopers llp tax compliance and research and experimentation credit consultations  tax compliance and consultations related to our foreign operations  and tax consultations with respect to our equity incentive plan and other compensation plans 
factors affecting future operating results risks relating to our business we have a narrow product range and our products may become obsolete  or technological changes may reduce or limit increases in cmp consumption our business is substantially dependent on a single class of products  cmp slurries  which historically has accounted for almost all of our revenue 
our business would suffer if these products became obsolete or if consumption of these products decreased 
our success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and advances in the semiconductor industry and to adapt and improve our products in response to evolving customer needs and industry trends 
since its inception  the semiconductor industry has experienced rapid technological changes and advances in the design  manufacture  performance and application of ic devices and these changes and advances  including mm wafers  are expected to continue in the future 
developments in the semiconductor industry could render our products obsolete or less important to the ic device manufacturing process 
a significant amount of our business comes from a limited number of large customers and our revenue and profits could decrease significantly if we lost one or more of them as customers our customer base is concentrated among a limited number of large customers 
one or more of these principal customers may stop buying cmp slurries from us or may substantially reduce the quantity of cmp slurries they purchase from us 
they also hold considerable purchasing power which can impact the pricing and terms of sale of our products 
any cancellation  deferral or significant reduction in cmp slurries sold to these principal customers or a significant number of smaller customers could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in fiscal year  our five largest customers  of which two are distributors  accounted for approximately of our revenue  with marketech a distributor we use in taiwan and china  and intel accounting for approximately and of our revenue  respectively 
in june  we completed our transition to selling directly to customers in europe  singapore and malaysia who previously had been serviced through metron 
as a result  we expect this distributor will no longer be one of our top five customers 
in fiscal year  our five largest customers  of which two are distributors  accounted for approximately of our revenue  with marketech and intel accounting for approximately and of our revenue  respectively 
demand for our products and our business may be adversely affected by worldwide economic and industry conditions our business is affected by current economic and industry conditions and it is extremely difficult to predict sales of our products given uncertainties in these factors 
for example  our quarterly revenue trends in fiscal years through have been affected by the global economic slowdown and weakening in demand for electronic systems  coupled with higher than normal chip inventories 
sales improved in the second half of fiscal in anticipation of an industry recovery which did not materialize 
we believe this resulted in an overbuilding of inventory of ic devices which adversely impacted the first half of fiscal while there are currently some encouraging signs of a semiconductor industry recovery  any further declines or lack of improvement in current economic and industry conditions could continue to adversely affect our business 
any problem or interruption in supply of our most important raw materials  including fumed metal oxides  could delay our slurry production and adversely affect our sales fumed metal oxides  both fumed silica and fumed alumina  are significant raw materials we use in many of our cmp slurries 
our business would suffer from any problem or interruption in our supply of fumed metal oxides or other key raw materials 
we entered into a fumed metal oxide agreement with cabot corporation  which became effective upon completion of our initial public offering in april in december we entered into a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation and an amendment to the fumed metal oxide agreement with respect to fumed alumina 
under these agreements  cabot corporation continues to be our primary supplier of certain fumed metal oxides for our slurry products produced as of the date of our initial public offering with respect to fumed silica and as of the effective date of the fumed alumina supply agreement with respect to certain amounts of fumed alumina 
we believe it would be difficult to secure alternative sources of fumed metal oxides in the event cabot corporation or another supplier is unable to supply us with sufficient quantities of fumed metal oxides which meet the quality and technical specifications required by our customers 
in addition  contractual amendments to the existing agreements with  or non performance by  cabot corporation or another supplier  could adversely affect us as well 
in addition  if we change the supplier or type of key raw materials such as fumed metal oxides we use to make our existing cmp slurries or are required to purchase them from a different manufacturer or manufacturing facility  whether cabot corporation or another party  or otherwise modify our products  in certain circumstances our customers might have to requalify our cmp slurries for their manufacturing processes and products 
the requalification process could take a significant amount of time to complete  possibly interrupting or reducing our sales of cmp slurries to these customers 
our business could be seriously harmed if our existing or future competitors develop superior slurry products  offer better pricing terms or service  obtain certain intellectual property rights or if any of our major customers develop or increase in house slurry manufacturing capability competition from current cmp slurry manufacturers  new entrants to the cmp slurry market or a decision by any of our major customers to produce  or increase the production of slurry products in house could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
competition has increased from other existing providers of cmp slurries and opportunities exist for other companies with sufficient financial or technological resources to emerge as potential competitors by developing their own cmp slurry products 
the existence or threat of increased competition and additional in house production could impact the prices we are able to charge for our slurry products 
we may also face competition arising from significant changes in technology  such as the development of polishing pads containing abrasives and emerging technologies such as electrical chemical mechanical planarization ecmp 
in addition  our competitors could have or obtain intellectual property rights which could restrict our ability to market our existing products and or to innovate and develop new products 
because we have limited experience in manufacturing and selling cmp polishing pads  expansion of our business into this area may not be successful an element of our strategy is to leverage our current customer relationships and technological expertise to expand our business into new product areas and applications  including manufacturing and distributing cmp polishing pads 
we have had limited experience in developing  manufacturing and marketing these products  which involve technologies and production processes that are relatively new to us 
we  our suppliers of the raw materials that we use to develop our polishing pads  or our provider of pads for whom we act as value added reseller  may not be able to produce products that satisfy our customers needs 
in addition  we  our suppliers or pad provider may be unable to keep pace with technological or other developments in the design and production of polishing pads 
also  our competitors may have or obtain intellectual property rights which could restrict our ability to market our existing products and or to innovate and develop new products

we encounter risks in doing business in certain foreign countries  including but not limited to  adverse changes in economic and political conditions  as well as the difficulty in enforceability of business and customer contracts and agreements  including protection of intellectual property rights 
in june we completed our transition to selling directly to customers in europe  singapore and malaysia who previously had been serviced through metron  a third party distributor 
selling directly may increase our risk of conducting business in foreign countries 
because we rely heavily on our intellectual property  our failure to adequately obtain or protect it could seriously harm our business protection of intellectual property is particularly important in our industry because cmp slurry and pad manufacturers develop complex and technical formulas for cmp products which are proprietary in nature and differentiate their products from those of competitors 
our intellectual property is important to our success and ability to compete 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  as well as employee and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements 
our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could seriously harm our business 
our inability to attract and retain key personnel could cause our business to suffer if we fail to attract and retain the necessary managerial  technical and customer support personnel  our business and our ability to maintain existing and obtain new customers  develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer 
competition for qualified personnel  particularly those with significant experience in the cmp and ic device industries  is intense 
the loss of services of key employees could harm our business and results of operations

anti takeover provisions under our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and our rights plan may discourage third parties from making an unsolicited bid for our company our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  our rights plan and various provisions of the delaware general corporation law may make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company 
for example  our amended certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to million shares of blank check preferred stock and to attach special rights and preferences to this preferred stock 
also our amended certificate of incorporation provides for the division of our board of directors into three classes as nearly equal in size as possible with staggered three year terms 
in addition  the rights issued to our stockholders under our rights plan may make it more difficult or expensive for another person or entity to acquire control of us without the consent of our board of directors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management we conduct business operations outside of the united states through our foreign operations 
our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the japanese yen and  to a lesser extent  the british pound and the euro 
from time to time we enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure 
however  we may be unable to hedge these exposures completely 
approximately of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
market risk and sensitivity analysis foreign exchange rate risk during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of we had a foreign exchange exposure related to a note receivable from our wholly owned subsidiary denominated in japanese yen which resulted in unrealized foreign exchange gains of million 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we hedged this exposure 
we continue to hedge this exposure and believe that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk on this note is not material 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates 
as of september   the analysis demonstrated that such market movements would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows over a one year period 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency rate movements and our actual exposures
