this was achieved by increasing rents  opening four new centers  expanding eight centers and acquiring centers that was partially offset by rent decreases from selling six non core centers

funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo should be considered in conjunction with net income  as presented in the statements of operations included elsewhere herein  to facilitate a clearer understanding of the operating results of the company 
the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of nareit in october defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of the ability of the company to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
ffo for the year ended december   excludes the chelsea interactive impairment loss of million 
since all companies do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  the company s calculation of ffo presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measure as reported by other companies 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions

in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no

sfas supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas retains fundamental provisions of sfas related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
in addition  sfas superseded apb opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas extended the reporting of a discontinued operation to a component of an entity 
thus  the operations of assets held for sale or assets sold are required to be presented as discontinued operations in the company s statement of income

the new standard addresses the income statement classification of gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt and criteria for classification as extraordinary items 
the new standard became effective for fiscal years beginning after may  the company adopted this pronouncement on april  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position

 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin clarifies the application of existing accounting pronouncements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of fin will be immediately effective for all variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and the company will need to apply its provisions to any existing variable interests in variable interest entities by no later than december  the company does not believe that fin will have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
bad debt the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its tenants to make required rent payments 
if the financial condition of the company s tenants were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts included in tenant accounts receivable totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
valuation of investments on a periodic basis  the company s management team assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of real estate properties  including joint venture properties may be impaired 
if the carrying amount of the property is greater than the estimated expected future cash flow undiscounted and without interest charges of the asset  impairment has occurred 
the company will then record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
the company does not believe that the value of any of its rental properties were impaired at december  and the company recorded a million impairment loss in on its investment in chelsea interactive and a million loss in for an impairment write down of its investment in an outlet center in guam 
economic conditions substantially all leases contain provisions  including escalations of base rents and percentage rentals calculated on gross sales  to mitigate the impact of inflation 
inflationary increases in common area maintenance and real estate tax expenses are substantially reimbursed by tenants 
virtually all tenants have met their lease obligations and the company continues to attract and retain quality tenants 
the company intends to reduce operating and leasing risks by continually improving its tenant mix  rental rates and lease terms and by pursuing contracts with creditworthy upscale and national brand name tenants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its floating rate debt arrangements 
in december  the company implemented a policy to protect against interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
the company s primary strategy is to protect against this risk by using derivative transactions as appropriate to minimize the variability that floating rate interest and foreign currency fluctuations could have on cash flow 
in december  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective january  with a financial institution for a notional amount of million amortizing to million to hedge against unfavorable fluctuations in the libor rates of its secured mortgage loan facility 
the hedge effectively produces a fixed rate of on the notional amount until january  at december  a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in us treasury and libor rates applied to unhedged debt would adversely affect the company s annual interest cost by approximately million annually 
following is a summary of the company s debt obligations at december  in thousands expected maturity date thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt   average interest rate variable rate debt  average interest rate
