quarterly financial results unaudited edmc has experienced seasonality in its results of operations primarily due to the pattern of student enrollment 
historically  edmc s lowest quarterly revenues and income have been in the first quarter july to september of its fiscal year due to fewer students being enrolled during the summer months and the expenses incurred in preparation for the peak enrollment in the fall quarter october to december 
the company expects that this seasonal trend will continue 
the following table sets forth the company s quarterly results for and quarter ended sept 
summer dec 
fall mar 
winter june spring dollars in thousands  except per share data net revenues income before interest and income taxes income before income taxes net income earnings per share basic diluted net revenues income before interest and income taxes income before income taxes net income earnings per share basic diluted at the beginning of the fourth quarter of  the company evaluated the useful lives for its property and equipment and revised the lives of certain classes of such assets  as necessary  to more closely reflect actual usage 
this adjustment in the fourth quarter decreased income before interest and income taxes by million 
net income and basic and diluted earnings per share were reduced by million and  respectively 
earnings per share amounts for each quarter are required to be calculated independently and therefore may not total to the amount calculated for the year 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company s unrestricted cash balance was million  a decrease of million from million at june  the reduction in cash and cash equivalents as compared to is a result of the timing of the art institutes summer academic quarter  which started nine days later in than in student loan proceeds normally received by electronic transfer in the last week of june were received in early july  because federal regulations provide for the payment of these funds only within days before the start of classes 
total loan proceeds received by the art institutes within days of the start of the summer quarter increased to million this year from million last year  and all of the funds were received in july 
in the previous fiscal year  these funds were received in june 
cash flow from operations was million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease of million in cash flow from operations for fiscal is due primarily to the timing of receipt of financial aid for the art institutes summer term discussed in the preceding paragraph 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in net income and non cash charges 
cash flow from operating and investing activities does not reflect capital expenditures of approximately million  million and million  which were included in accounts payable as of june   and  respectively 
additionally  cash flow from operating and financing activities does not reflect income tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these deductions do not affect the company s tax provision  the benefit is recorded as additional paid in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
therefore  the change in the applicable consolidated balance sheet accounts accounts payable  property and equipment  accrued liabilities and additional paid in capital does not directly correlate to the corresponding amounts in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows 
the company had net working capital of approximately million as of june   an increase of million from  as of june  the increase in net working capital is a result of increases in other current assets  prepaid income taxes  moderate growth in net accounts receivable  and a slight decrease in accounts payable 
as of june   gross trade accounts receivable increased by million to million  or  from the prior year end balance of million primarily due to acquisitions and higher student enrollment and tuition rates 
certain recently acquired schools within the art institutes system have not yet been converted to the quarter system used by most of the art institutes and were in session as of year end 
under the payout terms  the corresponding accounts receivable balances at such schools would be reduced by the end of the applicable class sessions 
although tuition increases have exceeded corresponding increases in federal financial aid sources  the company has arranged for alternative financing for students to reduce receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of june  and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represented of gross accounts receivable as of june   as compared to for this reduction in the reserve for bad debts reflects better overall receivable management  as evidenced by lower bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues 
in addition  a higher portion of accounts receivable at june  relate to programs in session at year end 
receivables related to tuition and related charges for classes in session have historically proven to be realizable and therefore require less of a reserve 
the company determines its reserve for accounts receivable by categorizing gross receivables based upon the enrollment status of the student  then establishing a reserve based on the likelihood of collection 
the company sometimes provides for extended payment terms beyond graduation generally six months 
as more students have utilized this option  the out of school category has grown as a percentage of gross receivables  which has resulted in an increase in the corresponding allowance against these balances 
therefore  the change between years in the allowance results from both the overall increase in trade receivables as well as changes in the distribution of gross receivables among the categories 
student accounts are monitored through an aging process whereby past due accounts are pursued 
when certain criteria are met and internal collection measures have been taken  the account is placed with an outside collection agency

subsequent to june   the company and its lenders entered into an amended and restated credit agreement see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to provide additional borrowing availability 
allowable borrowings increased from million to million 
the new credit agreement expires august  certain outstanding letters of credit reduce availability under this facility 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants that  among other matters  require the company to meet specified financial ratios  restrict the repurchase of common stock and limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
the following table describes the company s commitments as of june  under various contracts and agreements in thousands total amounts committed payments due by period less than year years years over years line of credit borrowings standby letters of credit mortgage obligation operating leases total commitments these borrowings were repaid in early july under the terms of the company s credit agreement  all outstanding borrowings become due at expiration of the facility in fiscal the company does not anticipate these letters of credit will be drawn on 
borrowings under the credit agreement are used by the company primarily to fund acquisitions and working capital needs resulting from the seasonal pattern of cash receipts throughout the year 
the level of accounts receivable reaches a peak immediately after the billing of tuition and fees at the beginning of each academic quarter 
collection of these receivables is greatest the start of each academic quarter 
subsequent to june   borrowings of approximately million under the credit agreement were used to fund the acquisition of american education centers see note in the accompanying financial statements

the company anticipates that future expenditures  estimated to be approximately million in  will be financed primarily through cash flow from operations and cash on hand  supplemented as needed with borrowings under the credit agreement

on july   the company acquired percent of the outstanding stock of south university south 
south has four campuses in the southeastern united states and offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in business  legal studies  information technology and health sciences fields 
the company paid approximately million for south  which includes million held in escrow 
funds from this account will be transferred to the previous owner if certain conditions are met 
these conditions relate primarily to the development and performance of certain health profession programs 
the acquisition is subject to receipt of final regulatory approvals 
on september   the company acquired percent of the outstanding stock of american education centers aec headquartered in a suburb of cincinnati  ohio 
aec operates educational institutions in eight states mainly in the midwest  offering programs in health sciences  business  information technology  legal studies and design technologies 
the company paid approximately million in cash and assumed million in debt  which was subsequently repaid 
the acquisition is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals 
the company expects that south and aec will create heightened growth in consolidated revenue and operating income for in subsequent years  the company expects these entities to have revenue growth consistent with the company s historical trends and to offer the potential for the company to have improvement in operating margins somewhat greater than the historical average over the past several years 
regulations the company indirectly derived approximately  and of its net revenues from title iv programs in  and  respectively 
us department of education regulations prescribe the timing of disbursements of funds under title iv programs 
students must apply for a new loan for each academic year 
lenders generally provide loan funds in multiple disbursements each academic year 
for first time students in their first academic quarter  the initial loan disbursement is generally received at least days after the commencement of that academic quarter 
otherwise  the first loan disbursement is received  at the earliest  ten days before the commencement of the student s academic quarter 
us department of education regulations require title iv program funds received by the company s schools in excess of the tuition and fees owed by the relevant students at that time to be  with these students permission  maintained and classified as restricted funds until they are billed for the portion of their education program related to those funds 
funds transferred through electronic funds transfer programs are held in a separate cash account and released when certain conditions are satisfied 
these restrictions have not significantly affected the company s ability to fund daily operations 
education institutions participating in title iv programs must satisfy a series of specific standards of financial responsibility 
the us department of education has adopted standards to determine an institution s financial responsibility to participate in title iv programs 
the regulations establish three ratios i the equity ratio  intended to measure an institution s capital resources  ability to borrow and financial viability  ii the primary reserve ratio  intended to measure an institution s ability to support current operations from expendable resources  and iii the net income ratio  intended to measure an institution s profitability 
each ratio is calculated separately  based on the figures in the institution s most recent annual audited financial statements  and then weighted and combined to arrive at a single composite score 
such composite score must be at least for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without conditions or additional oversight 
regulations promulgated under the hea also require all proprietary education institutions to comply with the rule  which prohibits participating schools from deriving or more of total revenue from title iv programs in any year 
if an institution fails to meet any of these requirements  it may be deemed to be not financially responsible by the us department of education  or otherwise ineligible to participate in title iv programs 
the company believes that all of its participating schools met these requirements as of june  critical accounting policies in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  judgements and estimates are made about the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as part of the financial reporting process  the company s management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base judgements and develop estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
historical experience and available information are used to make these judgements and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the significant accounting policies described in note in the accompanying financial statements  the company believes that the following discussion addresses its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition and receivables the company s net revenues consist of tuition and fees  student housing charges and bookstore and restaurant sales 
the company derived   and of its net revenues from tuition and fees paid by  or on behalf of  its students in  and  respectively 
net revenues are reduced for student refunds and scholarships 
bookstore and restaurant revenue is recognized when the sale occurs 
advance payments represent that portion of payments received but not earned and are reflected as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these payments are typically related to future academic periods and are  for the most part  refundable 
the company bills tuition and housing revenues at the beginning of an academic term and recognizes the revenue on a pro rata basis over the term of instruction or occupancy 
for most art institute programs  the academic and fiscal quarters are the same  therefore  unearned revenue is not significant at the end of a fiscal quarter 
however  certain recently acquired schools including argosy have programs with class starting and ending dates that differ from the company s fiscal quarters 
therefore  at the end of the fiscal quarter  the company has revenue from these programs that has not yet been earned in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
unearned tuition revenue of approximately million and million  related to programs not on the art institutes quarterly academic calendar  is included with advance payments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of june  and  respectively 
argosy s academic programs follow a semester schedule and several programs were in session as of june  accordingly  unearned revenue of approximately million and million related to argosy is included with advance payments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for and  respectively 
refunds are calculated in accordance with federal  state and accrediting agency standards 
student refunds of approximately million and million were recorded for and  respectively 
the trade receivable balances are comprised of individually insignificant amounts due primarily from students throughout the united states and canada 
the company determines its allowance for doubtful accounts by categorizing gross receivables based upon the enrollment status of the student and establishing a reserve based on the likelihood of collection 
student accounts are monitored through an aging process whereby past due accounts are pursued 
when certain criteria are met and internal collection measures have been taken  the account is placed with an outside collection agency 
student accounts in collections are evaluated on a case by case basis before being written off 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of property  plant and equipment to be held and used and intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include economic conditions or operating performance 
the company s evaluation is based upon assumptions about the estimated future cash flows 
if the discounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the company would recognize an impairment loss 
the company continually applies its best judgement when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
the company evaluates the recoverability of the goodwill attributable to each reporting unit and intangible assets not being amortized as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the company continually applies its best judgement when performing these evaluations to determine the financial projections used to assess the fair value of each reporting unit 
income taxes the company calculates income taxes in accordance with statement on financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the company has generated foreign and state operating loss carryforwards 
management has determined that it is currently more likely than not that the benefit will be realized and has not established a valuation allowance against these assets 
the utilization of the net deferred tax asset recorded for net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on the execution of certain tax planning strategies and the generation of future taxable income 
the company has continuously implemented these tax planning strategies and plans to implement these strategies in the future 
the company will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
new accounting standards in december  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas was issued 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
finally  this statement amends accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
the company has evaluated the impact of this statement and has adopted the required disclosure provisions
