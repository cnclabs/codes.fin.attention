the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal rate was the net effect of a domestic tax rate combined with a foreign tax rate on taxable net income 
the decreased effective rate was primarily due to a higher proportion of foreign taxable income in fiscal seasonality and inflation group in the past has experienced greater sales and earnings in the january march quarter  the fourth quarter of its fiscal year  there can be no assurance  however  that this will occur in the future 
this seasonal factor is believed to be attributable to buying patterns of major accounts and also to fiscal year incentives for group s sales representatives 
group s revenue and resultant earnings have shown substantial variation on a quarter to quarter basis 
the company s license agreements represent the culmination of sales cycles averaging three to six months 
any significant lengthening in the sales cycle can have the effect of moving revenue from one quarter into the next  contributing to quarter to quarter variations 
prices remain stable for group s products 
inflation directly affects group s cost structure principally in the areas of associate compensation and benefits  occupancy and support services and supplies 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital was million at march  as compared with million a year earlier 
the current ratio was to at march  and to at march  note that the current portion of deferred revenue related to maintenance contracts is included in current liabilities

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers the accounting policies related to revenue recognition to be critical to the understanding of our results of operations 
these critical accounting policies also include the areas where the company has made the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in making estimates  and where these estimates can significantly impact the company s financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenues are primarily derived from the sale of software licenses and from the sale of related services  which include maintenance and support  consulting and training services 
revenues from license arrangements are recognized upon delivery of the product when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
if the agreement includes acceptance criteria  revenue is not recognized until the company can demonstrate that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria and customer acceptance has been verified 
if an ongoing vendor obligation exists under the license arrangement  revenue is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered element 
if vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for all undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
revenues from annual maintenance and support are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
revenues from consulting and training services are deferred and recognized when the services are performed and collectibility is deemed probable 
license fee payment terms are not tied to milestone deliverables or customer acceptance 
if payment terms extend beyond our normal terms  revenue is recognized as the payments become due 
the amount of deferred revenue at march  to be recognized during the subsequent years is in thousands and beyond contracts for professional services are negotiated individually 
the company generally recognizes revenues from professional service contracts on a time and materials basis as the work is performed 
revenues from fixed price professional service contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method as work is performed  measured primarily by the ratio of labor hours incurred to total estimated labor hours for each specific contract 
when the total estimated cost of a contract is expected to exceed the contract price  the total estimated loss is charged to expense in the period when the information is known 
as of march   the company has not incurred any losses on contracts in progress 
revenue from arrangements where the company provides web based services is recognized over the contract period 
any fees paid or costs incurred prior to the customer relationship period  such as license fees  consulting  customization or development services  are deferred and recognized ratably over the subsequent contract period  which is typically one to two years 
revenue from products licensed to original equipment manufacturers is recorded when products have been shipped and the appropriate documentation has been received by group  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
revenue from sales through value added resellers or distributors is recorded when a license agreement is signed with an end user and product has been shipped 
allowance for doubtful accounts group maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of group customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of march   our accounts receivable balance  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million  was million  which included no customers who accounted for over of the net trade accounts receivable 
capitalized software in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
software development costs capitalized include direct labor costs and fringe labor overhead costs attributed to programmers  software engineers  quality control and field certifiers working on products after they reach technological feasibility but before they are generally available to customers for sale 
capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated product life of three to five years  using the greater of the straight line method or the ratio of current product revenues to total projected future revenues 
at the balance sheet date  the company evaluates the net realizable value of the capitalized costs and adjusts the current period amortization for any impairment of the capitalized asset value 
goodwill the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
effective april  and upon adoption ceased to amortize goodwill 
sfas no 
requires goodwill amortization to cease and for goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its earnings amount 
the company performed the required annual impairment assessment of goodwill balances in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
during the third quarter fiscal and concluded that goodwill of its reporting units was not impaired 
since no event occurred or circumstances changed during the company s fourth quarter of fiscal that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its earnings amount  no impairment was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of group below its earnings amount  goodwill impairment charges may be required 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair market value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired in various acquisitions and  prior to fiscal year  was amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic useful life ranging from nine to fifteen years 
goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  was million at both march  and there was no goodwill amortization expense during fiscal years and in accordance with sfas nos 
and  as discussed above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has a subsidiary in the united kingdom with offices throughout continental europe 
additionally  the company uses third party distributors to market and distribute its products in other international regions 
transactions conducted by the subsidiary are typically denominated in the local country currency  while transactions conducted by the distributors are typically denominated in pounds sterling 
as a result  the company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of its subsidiary and third party distributors are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and impact overall expected profitability 
through and as of march   however  the company s exposure was not material to the financial statements taken as a whole 
the company has not entered into any foreign currency hedging transactions with respect to its foreign currency market risk 
the company does not have any financial instruments subject to material market risk 
risk factors our total revenue and operating results may fluctuate 
we may experience a shortfall in revenue or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially and adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock 
our total revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include  but are not necessarily limited to level of product  services and price competition length of our sales cycle and customer licensing patterns the size and timing of individual license transactions delay or deferral of customer purchase and implementations of our products success in expanding or maintaining our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels timing of new product introductions and product enhancements appropriate mix of products licensed and services sold levels of international transactions activities of and acquisitions by competitors labor turnover and timing of new hires and the allocation of our resources changes in the economy and foreign currency exchange rates our ability to develop and market new products and control costs satisfactory completion of services we provide performance of key third party service providers one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high during any given period or may cause our net revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our total revenue and operating results may vary drastically from quarter to quarter 
the main factors that may affect these fluctuations are the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles the potential delays in recognizing revenue from license transactions the timing of new product releases seasonal variations in operating results variations in the fiscal or quarterly cycles of our customers the size and complexity of our license transactions domestic and international business conditions each customer s decision to purchase our products and services is discretionary and is subject to its budget cycles 
in addition  the timing of license revenue is difficult to predict because of the length of our sales cycle  which has ranged to date from one to eighteen months 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends 
because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in recognizing revenue from license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in operating losses 
if these expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by increased revenues  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of these and other factors  revenues for any quarter are subject to significant variation and we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
the reader should not rely on these comparisons as indications of future performance 
we need to integrate acquisitions and manage growth successfully 
our business strategy includes pursuing opportunities to grow our business  both internally and through selective acquisitions and strategic alliances 
our ability to implement this strategy depends  in part  on our success in making such acquisitions and strategic alliances on satisfactory terms and successfully integrating them into our operations 
these acquisitions may initially cause dilution of earnings and may impose significant strains on our management  operating systems and financial resources 
failure to manage this growth  or unexpected difficulties encountered during expansion  could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we acquired three companies during fiscal and have announced a pending acquisition subsequent to march  the company s ongoing strategy includes pursuing additional acquisitions 
we may not be able to successfully assimilate the additional personnel  operations  acquired technology and products into our business 
in particular  we will need to assimilate and retain key professional services  sales  development and marketing personnel 
key personnel from the acquired companies may in the future decide to pursue other opportunities 
in addition  it may be necessary to integrate products of these companies with our technology  and it is uncertain whether we may accomplish this easily or at all 
these integration difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract management and employees or increase expenses 
acquisitions are inherently risky  and we may also face unexpected costs  which may adversely affect operating results in any quarter 
due to these and other factors  we may not meet expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to revenues or other operating results of the combined company  which could adversely affect our stock price economic conditions could adversely affect our revenue growth and ability to forecast revenue the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our software products and services 
because our sales are primarily to major corporate customers our business is subject to fluctuations based on overall economic conditions 
the general weakening of the global economy caused a decrease in our software license revenues in fiscal a softening of demand for computer software caused by renewed weakening of the economy  domestically or internationally  may result in lower revenues and growth rates 
our revenue pipeline estimates may not consistently correlate to actual revenues in a particular quarter or over a long period of time 
a slowdown in the economy  domestically or internationally  may cause customer purchasing decisions to be delayed  reduced in amount or canceled  all of which could reduce the rate of conversion of the pipeline into contracts 
a variation in the pipeline or in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts could cause us to plan or budget improperly and thereby could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  primarily due to a substantial portion of our license contracts closing in the latter part of the quarter  and our costs being primarily fixed  management may not be able to adjust our cost structure in response to a variation in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts in a timely manner  thereby adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the internet related products and services market 
group s web service applications communicate through public and private networks over the internet 
the success of our products may depend  in part  on our ability to continue developing products that are compatible with the internet 
we cannot predict with any assurance whether the demand for internet related products and services will increase or decrease in the future 
the increased commercial use of the internet could require substantial modification and customization of our products and the introduction of new products 
critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including security  privacy  demand  reliability  rate of adoption  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service and potential tax or other government regulation  remain unresolved and may affect the use of the internet as a medium to support the functionality of our products and distribution of our software 
if these critical issues are not favorably resolved  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our continued success will require us to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
the software market in which we compete is characterized by i rapid technological change  ii frequent introductions of new products  iii changing customer needs and iv evolving industry standards 
to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs  we must support existing products and develop new products 
we may not be successful in developing  marketing and releasing new products or new versions of our products that respond to technological developments  evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements 
we may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and sale of these enhancements 
in addition  these enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance 
if release dates of any future products or enhancements to group s products are delayed  or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  new products or enhancements by our competitors may cause customers to defer or forego purchases of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
software errors or defects in our products could reduce revenues 
software products frequently contain errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released  and could be affected by viruses 
we have  in the past  been forced to delay the commercial release of products until software problems have been corrected 
we could lose revenues as a result of software viruses  errors or defects  including defects in third party products with which our products work 
testing errors may also be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  damage to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we do not successfully manage our growth  our business may be negatively impacted 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our business has grown rapidly in recent years 
this growth has placed a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
in addition  this growth may require us to implement new systems or upgrade current systems  and the failure to successfully implement such new or improved systems could materially and adversely affect our business 
to manage future growth  we must continue to i implement and improve our financial  operational and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis and ii expand  train and manage our employee work force 
failure to meet regulatory requirements set by the usps and cpc could have a negative impact on revenues 
we are required to maintain many of our products in accordance with regulatory standards set by the us and canadian postal authorities 
failure to meet these requirements could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our expanding distribution channels may create additional risks 
failure to minimize channel conflicts could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have a number of relationships with resellers  which assist us in obtaining broad market coverage 
we have generally avoided exclusive relationships with resellers of our products 
discount policies and reseller licensing programs are intended to support each distribution channel with a minimum level of channel conflicts 
if we do not maintain our relationships with third party vendors  interruptions in the supply of our products may result 
we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software and data currently offered with our products if that software or data becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
portions of our products incorporate software or data that was developed and is maintained by third party software developers or data providers 
although we believe there are other sources for these products and data  any significant interruption in the supply could adversely impact our sales unless and until we can secure another source 
we depend in part on these third parties ability to enhance their current products and data  to develop new products and update data on a timely and cost effective basis and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
the absence of or any significant delay in the replacement of functionality provided by third party software in our products could materially and adversely affect our sales 
if we acquire additional companies  products or technologies  we may face risks similar to those faced in our other acquisitions 
we may continue to make other investments in companies  products or technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any other acquisition or investment 
if we acquire another company  we will likely face the same risks  uncertainties and disruptions as discussed above with respect to our other acquisitions 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or write down costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary information 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we also believe that the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
notwithstanding these  it may be possible for other persons to obtain copies of group s products 
group believes that because of the rapid pace of technological change in the technology industry and changes in postal regulations that affect several core products  copyright and trade secret protection are less significant than factors such as the knowledge and experience of group s management and other personnel and their ability to develop  enhance  market and acquire new products 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate 
although we do not believe that we are infringing on any proprietary rights of others  third parties may claim that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights 
furthermore  former employers of our former  current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of such former employers 
any such claims  with or without merit  could i be time consuming to defend  ii result in costly litigation  iii divert management s attention and resources  iv cause product delays in product and services deliveries and v require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license or create a workaround for such infringed or similar technology may materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we license certain software from third parties 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms 
the loss of  or inability to maintain  any of these software licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our international operations involve unique risks 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including i foreign currency fluctuations  ii economic or political instability  iii shipping delays and iv various trade restrictions 
any of these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis 
significant increases in the level of customs duties  export quotas or other trade restrictions could also have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in situations where direct sales are denominated in foreign currency  any fluctuation in foreign currency or the exchange rate may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  the gain or loss of significant contracts  changes in earning estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the software and computer industries and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar or related to ours and that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock
