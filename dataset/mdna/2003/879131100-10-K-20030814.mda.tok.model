business realignment costs business realignment costs represent actions to realign the company s cost structure in response to significant events and primarily include restructuring actions and impairment of assets resulting from reduced business levels 
restructuring actions taken during fiscal years and were intended to reduce the company s worldwide cost structure across all major functions in response to the dramatic economic decline  which severely impacted markets into which the company sells its products 
major operations impacted include manufacturing  engineering  sales  marketing and administrative functions 
the company expects to achieve future cost savings primarily by reducing employee headcount

the company began to achieve these savings during fiscal year as headcount was reduced during the year 
the company also incurred million for pension curtailment and settlement losses for the employees terminated in japan 
severance liabilities for actions taken in fiscal years and were reduced by million largely for employees that unexpectedly left voluntarily without severance 
an impairment charge of million was recognized for an intangible asset for acquired bluetooth technology 
the impairment of this intangible asset was due to the company s decision to limit investment into the development of products that utilize this technology 
during the first half of fiscal year  the company formed the opinion that the market potential for test and measurement products in the bluetooth area did not warrant significant investment relative to other product investment opportunities available to the company 
the impairment was determined using the present value of estimated cash flows related to the asset 
the closure of certain foreign and domestic operations resulted in credits totaling million for accumulated translation gains and an expense of million primarily for asset write downs and contractual obligations 
the company reversed million for a facility lease obligation due to the sale of the company s optical transmission test product line in the second quarter of fiscal year as the current sub lessee may not fulfill its lease obligation  the company accrued million during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these actions  other than the reduction of severance liabilities  do not relate to the previously announced plan discussed below 
cash payments during fiscal year primarily for severance totaled million for business realignment charges recorded in fiscal year the remaining liabilities as of may  for business realignment actions in fiscal year included million for severance expenses for employees and million for accrued liabilities related to the exit from certain operations 
cash payments during fiscal year for severance and other accrued liabilities was million for business realignment charges recorded in fiscal year the remaining liabilities as of may  for business realignment actions in fiscal year included million for severance expenses for employees and million for accrued liabilities related to the exit from certain operations 
fiscal year activity during fiscal year  the company incurred million of net business realignment charges including million of expenses to better align future operating expense levels with reduced sales levels offset by million of reserve reversals related to the plan which is discussed below 
the million of business realignment expenses included million of severance related costs for employees worldwide across all major functions and million associated with exiting certain foreign and domestic operations 
the million of costs associated with exiting certain foreign and domestic operations comprised million for loss on disposal of argentina and australia operations  million for lease cancellations  million write off of leasehold improvements and other assets and million for termination of a service contract in india during fiscal year during fiscal year  million of amounts recorded in prior years were reversed from the accrued liabilities reserve 
the reversal resulted primarily from the favorable settlement of various office leases 
cash payments during fiscal year for severance and other accrued liabilities totaled million for business realignment charges in fiscal year the remaining liabilities for severance and other accrued liabilities included million related to the severance expenses of employees and million related to the exit from certain operations in fiscal year these actions do not relate to the previously announced plan discussed below 
fiscal year activity total fiscal pre tax credits for business realignment charges  net on the consolidated statement of operations totaled million 
the net credits of million consisted of restructuring reversals of million  offset by million loss on sale of assets of maxtek components corporation maxtek  a wholly owned subsidiary of tektronix  and approximately million of adjustments to the existing restructuring plans 
in fiscal year  million of previously accrued amounts were reversed from the payables and other liabilities reserve primarily for certain obligations which were assumed by a third party and favorable contract buy out settlements 
in addition  accrued compensation reserves of million were reversed due to million for individuals who either left the company voluntarily or were re assigned to future benefiting operations and million of severance related to individuals associated with the assets sold by maxtek discussed below 
under the plan discussed below  certain assets and related employee severance costs of maxtek were included in the restructuring reserve as it was anticipated that they would be eliminated through closure 
as the opportunity to dispose of these assets through sale subsequently arose during fiscal year  and was determined by management to be more beneficial to the company  the related reserves were deemed no longer necessary  resulting in the reversals of accrued compensation of million and payables and other liabilities reserve of million 
the sale of those assets resulted in a pre tax loss on sale of assets of million 
in fiscal year  the payables and other liabilities reserve was increased by million primarily to provide for additional estimated costs related to exit activities and the accrued compensation reserve was increased by million for the subsequent clarification and amendment of an agreement with a terminated employee 
cash payments in fiscal year included million for severance payments for existing restructuring plans and million for other exit obligations 
fiscal year plan in connection with the sale of cpid and vnd  the company announced and began to implement a series of actions the plan in the third quarter of fiscal year  which were intended to further consolidate worldwide operations and transition the company to a smaller business focused on test  measurement and monitoring 
major actions under the plan included the exit from and consolidation within underutilized facilities  including the write off of assets that were abandoned in conjunction with this action  the write off and disposal of certain excess service and other inventories and focused headcount reductions to streamline the cost structure to that of a smaller focused measurement business and to eliminate duplicative functions within the company s infrastructure 
total restructuring charges in fiscal year for this plan were million which included million for write off of assets  million for contractual obligations  million for inventory impairment and million for employee severance and related costs 
critical accounting estimates management has identified the company s critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and operating results of the company and require difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses include contingent liabilities  intangible asset valuation  inventory valuation  pension plan assumptions and the assessment of the valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax reserves 
contingent liabilities the company is subject to claims or litigation concerning intellectual property  environmental and employment issues  as well as settlement of liabilities related to prior dispositions of assets 
as a result  liabilities have been established based upon management s best estimate of the ultimate outcome of these contingent liabilities 
the company reviews the status of its litigation  indemnities and other contingencies on a regular basis and adjustments are made as information becomes available 
as of may   the company had million recorded as contingent liabilities in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet  which comprised million related to the sale of cpid  million for environmental exposures and million for other contingent liabilities 
it is reasonably possible that management s estimates of contingent liabilities could change in the near term and that such changes could be material to the company s financial statements 
as a result of divestiture activities  the company is subject to certain contingencies due to contractual obligations entered into at the time of these divestitures and liabilities retained by the company 
included in these liabilities is a reserve for contingent liabilities related to the sale of cpid on january  the company s original accrual for estimated liabilities associated with the sale related to specific provisions in the sale agreement for indemnities and warranties as well as settlement of disputes over the value of net assets as of the transaction date 
the indemnities and warranties primarily relate to the company s obligation for liabilities existing prior to the closing date of january  subsequent to the close of the transaction  the company entered into an arbitration process to determine settlement of certain disputes regarding the value of the net assets transferred at the closing date 
this arbitration was resolved in the first quarter of fiscal year  resulting in an million payment by the company to the purchaser 
this settlement directly reduced the amount of the contingent liability reserve 
the accrual was further reduced by reversals of million during fiscal year the reversals were due to the company changing its estimate of probable exposures under the remaining indemnity and warranty provisions 
specifically  the company recorded reversals due to a the expiration of an indemnity period  which passed without the company receiving claims under the expiring provisions  b the resolution of certain outstanding potential exposures for amounts less than that anticipated by the company  and c other factors which reduced the company s estimate of probable exposures under the remaining indemnity and warranty provisions 
the reversals have been recorded net of tax effect in discontinued operations in the statements of operations for the year ended may  other changes in the contingent liability reserve were primarily for cash payments 
the remaining balance of this contingent liability is million as of may   a significant portion of which may take several years to resolve 
if unforeseen events or circumstances arise subsequent to the balance sheet date  changes in the estimate of the contingent liability could be material to the financial statements 
the company continues to closely monitor the status of the cpid related contingent liabilities based on information received 
the liability will be adjusted as settlements are completed or more information becomes available that will change the likely outcome 
changes to the estimate of liabilities or differences between these estimates and the ultimate amount of settlement will be recorded in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations in the period such events occur 
included in contingent liabilities is million specifically associated with the closure and cleanup of a licensed hazardous waste management facility at the company s beaverton  oregon campus 
the company established the initial liability in and based ongoing estimates on currently available facts and presently enacted laws and regulations 
costs for tank removal and cleanup were incurred in fiscal year costs currently being incurred primarily relate to ongoing monitoring and testing of the site 
management s best estimate of the range of remaining reasonably possible cost associated with this environmental cleanup  testing and monitoring is million to million  which is estimated to be incurred over the next several years 
if events or circumstances arise that are unforeseen to the company as of the balance sheet date  actual costs could differ materially from this estimate 
the remaining million of contingent liabilities includes amounts related to intellectual property and employment issues  as well as liabilities related to dispositions of assets other than cpid 
intangible assets the company adopted sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on accounting for business combinations and goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal year accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill from acquisitions  but continues to amortize other acquisition related intangibles and costs 
as of may   the company has million of goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting rules for goodwill  the company completed a goodwill impairment analysis as of the beginning of fiscal year with an update during the second quarter ended november   and identified no impairment 
as required by the new rules  the company performed an impairment analysis during the second quarter ended november   and again identified no impairment 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future market share and revenues and costs for the reporting units as well as appropriate discount rates 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
however  if the company fails to deliver new products for these groups  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable  revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and the company may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  management approved and initiated an active plan for the sale of its optical parametric test business 
this business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  the results of operations of the optical parametric test business have been excluded from continuing operations and recorded as discontinued operations 
the net carrying value of assets  primarily goodwill and other intangible assets  have been adjusted to estimated selling price less costs to sell which resulted in a million write down  net of income tax benefit of million  included in loss on sale of the optical parametric test business in fiscal year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  management approved and initiated an active plan for the sale of gage 
this business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  the results of operations of gage have been excluded from continuing operations and recorded as discontinued operations 
the company recognized an impairment charge in discontinued operations of million  net of income tax benefit of million  in fiscal year to write down the net assets  primarily for goodwill  of gage to net realizable value less estimated selling costs 
for intangible assets with definite useful lives  the company amortizes the cost over the estimated useful life and assesses any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as of may   the company had million of non goodwill intangible assets recorded in other long term assets  which includes patents and licenses for certain technology 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flow related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  the company may incur charges to impair these assets 
the impairment is based on the estimated discounted cash flow associated with the asset 
an impairment could result if the underlying technology fails to gain market acceptance  the company fails to deliver new products related to these technology assets  the products fail to gain expected market acceptance or if market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable 
during fiscal year  the company impaired an intangible asset related to acquired bluetooth technology resulting in an expense of million  which is included in business realignment costs credits in the consolidated statement of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on currently adjusted standard costs  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
the company s inventory includes raw materials  work in process  finished goods and demonstration equipment of million as of may  the company reviews its recorded inventory and estimates a write down for obsolete or slow moving items 
these write downs reduce the inventory value of these obsolete or slow moving items to their net realizable value 
such estimates are difficult to make under the current economic conditions 
the write down is based on current and forecasted demand and therefore  if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
in addition  excessive amounts of the used equipment in the marketplace can negatively impact the net realizable value of the company s demonstration equipment 
if actual market conditions are different than anticipated  cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations may be different than expected in the period in which more information becomes available 
the company recorded inventory write downs of approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the considerably larger write downs in fiscal year versus fiscal year were due to the large and unanticipated decrease in fiscal year sales volumes when compared with prior year sales volumes 
pension plan benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and yet represent obligations that will be settled far in the future and therefore are subject to certain estimates 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by the company 
the accounting standards require that management make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations 
as the rate of return on plan assets assumption is a long term estimate  it can differ materially from the actual return realized on plan assets in any given year  especially when markets are highly volatile 
excluding the pension plan related to the newly acquired japan subsidiary  the company s estimated long term rate of return on plan assets for fiscal year is 
a one percent change in the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a change in operating income of million for fiscal year net pension income  excluding the japan pension plans  was million for fiscal year  which was generated by the recognition of return on plan assets in excess of the associated pension expense 
the assumed return on plan assets will likely differ from the actual return on plan assets 
to the degree the actual return on plan assets is greater or less than the assumed return  an unrecognized gain or loss will accumulate  which may impact net income over future years 
assumed discount rates are used in measurements of the projected  accumulated  and vested benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost 
management makes estimates of discount rates to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
in making those estimates  management evaluates rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
the weighted average of discount rates used in determining the company s pension obligation as of may  was 
at may   the most recent valuation date  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets for certain pension plans 
in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for pensions  a minimum pension liability is recognized for the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
recognition of an additional minimum liability is required if an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation exists and a an asset has been recognized as prepaid pension cost  b the liability already recognized as unfunded accrued pension cost is less than the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation  or c no accrued or prepaid pension cost has been recognized 
the company has recognized an additional minimum liability in accordance with sfas since the additional minimum liability exceeded unrecognized prior service cost  the excess which would represent a net loss not yet recognized as net periodic pension cost is reported as a component of other comprehensive loss  net of applicable income tax benefit 
the company initially recorded an additional pension liability at the end of fiscal year  the first measurement date where the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets 
as of may  the cumulative additional minimum pension charge included in accumulated other comprehensive loss was million  net of income taxes of million 
the implication of the additional pension liability is that it may reduce net income in future years by reducing the market related value of plan assets  thereby reducing the asset base upon which the company recognizes a return 
additionally  the company may find it necessary to fund additional pension assets  which would increase the market related value of plan assets upon which the company recognizes a return  but would reduce operating cash and future interest earnings on that cash 
management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and will make adjustments to the assumption as appropriate 
pension income or expense is allocated to cost of sales  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
in connection with the sony tektronix acquisition  the company assumed the assets and liabilities of the japan subsidiary 
included in the liabilities assumed was a net pension liability of million as of september   the acquisition date 
the estimated return on plan assets assumed for this plan is 
only eight months of operations were included in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal year through may   million of net expense has been recognized associated with this japan based pension plan  of which million was due to settlement and curtailment of benefits for terminated employees in the fiscal year restructuring plan and included in business realignment costs in the consolidated statements of operations 
this net expense is based on estimates  in the same manner discussed for the above plans 
to the degree the actual return on plan assets is greater or less than the estimated return  an unrecognized gain or loss will accumulate  which may impact net income in future years 
income taxes the company is subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the company s annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment and is based on the best information available at the time 
the actual income tax liabilities to the jurisdictions with respect to any fiscal year are ultimately determined long after the financial statements have been published 
the company maintains reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
these tax jurisdictions include federal  state and various international tax jurisdictions 
significant income tax exposures include potential challenges of research and experimentation credits  export related tax benefits  disposition transactions and intercompany pricing 
exposures are settled primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause management of the company to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures  however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the liabilities are frequently reviewed for their adequacy 
as of may   the company was subject to income tax audits for fiscal years and the liabilities associated with these years will ultimately be resolved when events such as the completion of audits by the taxing jurisdictions occur 
to the extent the audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates  the effect would be recognized in income tax benefit expense in the consolidated statement of operations in the period of the event 
in september  the company negotiated a settlement with the united states internal revenue service irs with respect to their audit of the fiscal years through as a result of the audits settled and the current audit activity in progress  the company revised its estimated liability for income taxes as of august  the revision resulted in a million net reduction of previously estimated liabilities 
this had the effect of reducing accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and decreased the income tax expense on the consolidated statement of operations in the first quarter of fiscal year as of may   the company maintains estimated liabilities for open irs and other taxing jurisdiction assessments  as discussed above 
the settlement of additional open audits or changes in other circumstances could result in further material adjustment to the estimated liability and the associated tax expense in the period in which such events occur 
judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
as of may   the company had established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  primarily foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the company has not established valuation allowances against other deferred tax assets based on tax strategies planned to mitigate the risk of impairment to these assets 
accordingly  if the company s facts or financial results were to change thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine changes to the amount of the valuation allowance required to be in place on the financial statements in any given period 
the company continually evaluates strategies that could allow the future utilization of its deferred tax assets  including those related to tektronix japan 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the company implemented certain operational changes that were consistent with our tax planning strategies that are expected to result in the utilization of certain deferred tax assets for which valuation allowances had previously been established 
results of operations highlights of condensed consolidated results of continuing operations for the fiscal years ended may  may  may  in thousands  except per share amounts net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    research and development expenses    selling  general and administrative expenses   equity in business ventures loss earnings   business realignment costs credits    acquisition related costs  gain on the sale of video and networking division loss on disposition of assets   operating income    non operating income  net    income before taxes    income tax expense benefit    income from continuing operations    loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  net earnings    net earnings per share basic net earnings per share diluted income per share from continuing operations basic income per share from continuing operations diluted average shares outstanding basic    average shares outstanding diluted    fiscal year compared to fiscal year economic conditions beginning in the second half of fiscal year  and continuing through fiscal year  economic conditions had a significant negative impact on many markets into which the company sells products including  but not limited to  optical design and manufacturing  mobile handset manufacturing  automated test equipment  telecommunications and semiconductor design and manufacturing 
during fiscal year  these economic conditions continued to affect many of the markets into which the company sells products  although the impacts were less severe than in the prior years and certain markets appeared to begin to stabilize 
from a geographical perspective  the company began to see the economic environment stabilize in the united states and japan 
these regions experienced large declines in the prior year 
in response to the reduced level of orders and associated sales  the company incurred significant business realignment costs during fiscal years and the company incurred business realignment costs of million during fiscal year to reduce the company s cost structure in order to provide an amount of operating income that management believed was appropriate at the current sales levels and to adjust the cost structure of the newly acquired japan subsidiary 
management of the company is unable to predict the ultimate severity and duration of the recent economic conditions or their future impact on the company 
product orders product orders consist of cancelable commitments to purchase currently produced products by customers with delivery scheduled generally within six months of being recorded 
product orders for fiscal year were million  an increase of million or from product orders of million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the incremental impact of million from acquisition of the japan subsidiary in the current year 
to a lesser extent  the increase was also due to favorable customer acceptance of recently introduced products  an extra week of operations in fiscal year  which had weeks as compared with weeks in the prior year  as well as higher than average cancellations in the first quarter of fiscal year  which resulted from the impact of the economic conditions noted above 
orders from the americas for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million or from the prior year 
this decrease was largely due to orders from the other americas  which decreased to million  or from orders of million in the prior year 
orders from the united states for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million from orders of million in the prior year 
the slight decrease in orders in the americas is a result of the recent economic conditions noted above  which have continued to impact the company during fiscal year orders from japan were million  an increase of million or from fiscal year this increase in japan orders is primarily due to the million incremental impact from inclusion of orders from the newly acquired japan subsidiary 
the company completed the acquisition of the subsidiary in the second quarter of fiscal year for an additional discussion of this acquisition  see the recent transactions section of this management s discussion and analysis 
orders from the pacific  excluding japan  were million  up million or from the prior year 
this growth was primarily due to strong demand in china  korea and taiwan for general purpose products 
as noted above  the recent economic conditions have had a less severe impact on operations in the pacific region 
orders from europe increased slightly to million  an increase of million or from fiscal year  which benefited from favorable currency impact offset by continued difficult economic conditions in that region 
net sales net sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million from net sales of million in the same period of the prior year 
the decrease in net sales was the net result of two primary factors 
first  the company entered fiscal year with a substantial amount of order backlog  which was then reduced during fiscal year to generate sales 
accordingly  sales for fiscal year were comparatively large when compared to the orders for that fiscal year 
backlog was reduced million during fiscal year second  the decline in sales from fiscal year to was partially offset by the acquisition of the japan subsidiary  which provided approximately million of additional sales 
net sales from the americas for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million or from the prior year 
this decrease comprised the united states  which decreased to million  down  from million in the prior year and the other americas  which decreased to sales of million  down from million in the prior year 
the decrease in the americas was primarily the result of lower backlog levels  which constrained the company s ability to generate sales through the reduction of backlog as noted above 
net sales from japan were million  an increase of million or from sales in fiscal year  primarily due to a million increase resulting from the incremental impact of consolidation of the newly acquired japan subsidiary 
in addition  sales from the pacific  excluding japan  were million  up million or from the prior year 
this increase in the pacific region is the result of increased orders in this region during these comparative periods 
sales from europe declined to million  a decrease of million or from fiscal year largely due to lower backlog levels in the current year as compared to the prior year 
gross profit and gross margin gross profit for fiscal year was million  an increase of million or from gross profit in the same period last year 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal year compared to in the prior year 
the improvement in gross margin was attributable to the positive impact of consolidating tektronix japan since the second quarter of the current year 
in addition  charges associated with the impairment of inventory were approximately million in fiscal year  a decrease of million as compared with charges of approximately million during the prior year 
inventory impairment activity in fiscal year was abnormally high due to the dramatic decline in orders from fiscal year levels 
the company s gross margin was also favorably impacted by actions taken to reduce the cost structure in the manufacturing areas to better align with the lower order levels 
operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal year  including business realignment and acquisition related costs  were million  an increase of million from million for fiscal year operating expenses in fiscal year include million of incremental operating expenses resulting from the consolidation of tektronix japan 
business realignment costs and acquisition related costs were million  an increase of million from million for fiscal year these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of cost reduction actions implemented by the company 
cost reductions have primarily been achieved through reductions of headcount and to a lesser extent  through lower discretionary spending 
this resulted in operating income of million  or of net sales during the current year  compared with operating income of million  or of net sales in the prior year 
research and development expenses for fiscal year were million or of net sales  as compared with million or of net sales in the prior year 
the million decrease is the net result of higher spending in the prior year associated with the timing of new product development  partially offset by an extra week of operations in fiscal year and million of incremental expense from the consolidation of tektronix japan 
the company has initiated many actions to reduce its cost structure during fiscal years and  but the approach to research and development expenses has been very targeted to preserve critical product development in core strategic product categories 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were million or of net sales  an increase of million  as compared with million or of net sales during the prior year 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year reflects million of incremental expense from the consolidation of tektronix japan and an extra week of operations in fiscal year these increases were partially offset by the impact of headcount reductions and other cost restructuring actions enacted by the company 
equity in business ventures loss represents the company s share of net loss from sony tektronix 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company completed the acquisition of sony tektronix 
results prior to the date of acquisition are included in equity in business ventures loss at tektronix ownership percentage 
results subsequent to the acquisition date have been consolidated in the operating results of the company 
see the discussion in recent transactions section of the management s discussion and analysis for further information on this acquisition 
equity in business ventures loss was million for fiscal year  compared with equity losses of million for the prior year 
the company incurred million of business realignment costs in fiscal year for employee severance  impairment of an intangible asset  a facility lease obligation and closure of other facilities 
the company incurred million of severance for the termination of employees resulting from fiscal year actions to align the company s cost structure including million for former employees of tektronix japan 
the company also incurred million for pension curtailment and settlement losses for the employees terminated in japan 
an impairment charge of million was recognized to write down an intangible asset for acquired bluetooth technology 
the closure of certain foreign and domestic operations resulted in credits totaling million for accumulated translation gains and million primarily for asset write downs and contractual obligations 
the company reversed million for a facility lease obligation due to the sale of the company s optical transmission test product line in the second quarter of fiscal year as the current sub lessee may not fulfill its lease obligation  the company accrued million during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
see the business realignment costs section of the management s discussion and analysis and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on business realignment costs 
the company incurred acquisition related costs of million in fiscal year these costs represent direct incremental costs incurred as a result of the sony tektronix acquisition completed during the second quarter of fiscal year see the discussion in recent transactions section of the management s discussion and analysis for further information on this acquisition 
the company recognized a loss on disposal of fixed assets of million in fiscal year this compares with a loss on sale of fixed assets of million in the prior fiscal year 
the change from the prior year is largely due to the million impairment of a building in the second quarter of the prior fiscal year 
non operating income expense interest expense was million for fiscal year as compared with million in the prior year 
the overall decrease in interest expense is due to a reduction in the average balance of outstanding debt primarily from the extinguishment of million of long term debt on the scheduled payment date of august  interest income was million for fiscal year as compared with million in the prior year 
the decrease in interest income is primarily due to a lower average rate of return on invested cash in fiscal year as compared to average returns in fiscal year this reduction in average returns is due to decreases in interest rates during these periods 
the decrease in interest income is also partially attributable to a lower average balance of cash and marketable investments during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year other expense  net was million for fiscal year as compared with million in the prior year 
this includes items such as foreign currency exchange and other miscellaneous fees and expenses 
income taxes income tax benefit expense from continuing operations was a net benefit of million for fiscal year as compared with an expense of million in the prior year 
in the first quarter of the current year  the company recorded a million tax benefit resulting from the favorable settlement of irs audits for the company s fiscal years  and before the impact of this million tax benefit  the company s effective tax rate for fiscal year was as compared with for the prior fiscal year 
the reduction in effective tax rate is the result of effective tax planning strategies employed by the company 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations was million  or of sales for fiscal year  compared with million  or of sales for fiscal year discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal year  management approved and initiated an active plan for the sale of the optical parametric test business 
the loss from sale of the optical parametric test business of million  net of income taxes  for fiscal year includes a million write down  net of income taxes  of the carrying value of net assets which were adjusted to estimated selling price less costs to sell 
loss from operations of the optical parametric test business was million  net of income taxes  in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year during fiscal year  the company reversed accrued liabilities totaling million  net of income taxes  which were originally recorded in connection with the sale of cpid in january these amounts were reversed as new information became available to the company 
for additional discussion of the cpid divestiture see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as discussed in the recent transactions section above  the company sold the vt 
c subsidiary on november  the vt 
c subsidiary has been treated as a discontinued operation 
loss from discontinued operations of vt 
c was million for fiscal year compared to a net loss of million in fiscal year in fiscal year  the company incurred additional transaction related fees and other costs of million  net of income taxes  related to this sale 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  management approved and initiated an active plan for the sale of its gage subsidiary 
the company recognized an impairment charge of million  net of income taxes  in fiscal year to write down the net assets of gage to net realizable value less estimated selling costs 
loss from operations of gage was million  net of income taxes  in fiscal year compared to million  net of income taxes  in fiscal year net earnings loss the company recognized net earnings of million for fiscal year  a decrease of million from million recorded in the prior year 
this decrease was due to a number of factors  which include an million pre tax increase in business realignment costs and acquisition related costs over the prior year and a million net loss on the sale of the optical parametric test business 
these charges were partially offset by a million reversal of liabilities  net of tax  related to the sale of cpid discussed above  and the million income tax benefit from favorable settlement of the irs audit recorded in fiscal year earnings per share the company recognized basic and diluted earnings per share of for fiscal year for fiscal year  the company recognized basic and diluted earnings per share of and  respectively 
the decrease in earnings per share is a result of decreased net earnings discussed above which was offset by a decrease in the weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding due to shares repurchased by the company during fiscal years and fiscal year compared to fiscal year economic conditions beginning in fiscal year and continuing into fiscal year  economic conditions had a negative impact on many markets into which the company sells products including  but not limited to  optical design and manufacturing  mobile handset manufacturing  automated test equipment  telecommunications and semiconductor design and manufacturing 
capital spending within these industries declined significantly in fiscal year the telecommunications industry  and particularly the optical segment  experienced the most substantial downturns during fiscal year these conditions adversely impacted the company throughout fiscal year as product orders declined and product order cancellations were higher than in the prior year 
overall  these product orders and sales declines were more dramatic in the first half of fiscal year both sequentially and compared to the prior year 
from a geographical perspective  the large declines in demand experienced by the company during this economic decline were primarily in the united states  and to a lesser degree in europe 
the pacific region  excluding japan  was less dramatically affected by the economic decline 
in response to the reduced level of orders and associated sales  the company incurred net business realignment costs of million during fiscal year these costs were incurred in an effort to reduce fixed costs in future periods by reducing headcount and restructuring operations in certain foreign and domestic locations

risks and uncertainties described below are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
see forward looking statements at the beginning of this item market risk and cyclical downturns in the markets in which tektronix competes tektronix business depends on capital expenditures of manufacturers in a wide range of industries  including the telecommunications  semiconductor  and computer industries 
each of these industries has historically been very cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns  which have had a material adverse impact on the industries demand for equipment  including test and measurement equipment manufactured and marketed by tektronix 
in particular  the telecommunications industry  including but not limited to the optical segment  has experienced a more dramatic decline than other industries 
in addition  the severity and length of the downturn may also affect overall access to capital which could adversely affect the company s customers across many industries 
during periods of reduced and declining demand  tektronix may need to rapidly align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions while at the same time motivating and retaining key employees 
as discussed above in this item  the company s sales and orders have been affected by the current downturn in its markets 
the ultimate severity and duration of this downturn is unknown 
no assurance can be given that tektronix net sales and operating results will not be further adversely impacted by the current or any future downturns or slowdowns in the rate of capital investment in these industries 
timely delivery of competitive products tektronix sells its products to customers that participate in rapidly changing high technology markets  which are characterized by short product life cycles 
the company s ability to deliver a timely flow of competitive new products and market acceptance of those products  as well as the ability to increase production or to develop and maintain effective sales channels  is essential to growing the business 
because tektronix sells test and measurement products that enable its customers to develop new technologies  the company must accurately anticipate the ever evolving needs of those customers and deliver appropriate products and technologies at competitive prices to meet customer demands 
the company s ability to deliver such products could be affected by engineering or other development program delays as well as the availability of parts and supplies from third party providers on a timely basis and at reasonable prices 
failure to deliver competitive products in a timely manner and at a reasonable price could have an adverse effect on the results of operations  financial condition or cash flows of the company 
competition in general  tektronix competes with a number of companies in specialized areas of other test and measurement products and one large broad line measurement products supplier  agilent technologies 
other competitors include acterna corporation  anritsu  lecroy corporation  spirent  yokogawa and many other smaller companies 
competition in the company s business is based primarily on product performance  technology  customer service  product availability and price 
some of the company s competitors may have greater resources to apply to each of these factors and in some cases have built significant reputations with the customer base in each market in which tektronix competes 
the company faces pricing pressures that may have an adverse impact on the company s earnings 
if the company is unable to compete effectively on these and other factors  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
supplier risks the company s manufacturing operations are dependent on the ability of suppliers to deliver quality components  subassemblies and completed products in time to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules 
the company periodically experiences constrained supply of certain component parts in some product lines as a result of strong demand in the industry for those parts 
such constraints  if persistent  may adversely affect operating results until alternate sourcing can be developed 
volatility in the prices of these component parts  an inability to secure enough components at reasonable prices to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities and configurations demanded or  conversely  a temporary oversupply of these parts  could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
in addition  the company uses certain sole sourced components  which are integral to a variety of products 
disruption in key sole sourced suppliers could have a significant adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company distributes products of other manufacturers  which comprise a material portion of revenues 
to the extent that a distribution agreement is not continued  income could decline to the extent that this revenue source was not replaced by other product sales 
worldwide economic and market conditions the company maintains operations in four major geographies the americas  including the united states and other americas  including mexico  canada and south america  europe  including the middle east and africa  the pacific  including china  southeast asia and india  and japan 
during the last fiscal year  more than half of the company s revenues were from international sales 
in addition  some of the company s manufacturing operations and key suppliers are located in foreign countries  including china  where the company expects to further expand its operations 
as a result  the business is subject to the worldwide economic and market conditions risks generally associated with doing business globally  such as fluctuating exchange rates  the stability of international monetary conditions  tariff and trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies  foreign governmental regulations  political unrest  wars and other acts of terrorism  epidemic disease or other health concerns and changes in other economic or political conditions 
these factors  among others  could influence the company s ability to sell in global markets  as well as its ability to manufacture products or procure supplies 
a significant downturn in the global economy or a particular region could adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
intellectual property risks as a technology based company  tektronix success depends on developing and protecting its intellectual property 
tektronix relies generally on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and abroad 
electronic equipment as complex as most of the company s products  however  is generally not patentable in its entirety 
tektronix also licenses intellectual property from third parties and relies on those parties to maintain and protect their technology 
the company cannot be certain that actions the company takes to establish and protect proprietary rights will be adequate  particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected 
if the company is unable to adequately protect its technology  or if the company is unable to continue to obtain or maintain licenses for protected technology from third parties  it could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
from time to time in the usual course of business  the company receives notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or takes action against others with regard to intellectual property rights 
even where the company is successful in defending or pursuing such claims  the company may incur significant costs 
in the event of a successful claim against the company  tektronix could lose its rights to needed technology or be required to pay license fees for the infringed rights  either of which could have an adverse impact on the company s business 
environmental risks tektronix is subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of its hazardous chemicals used during the company s manufacturing process 
the company has operated and is in the process of closing a licensed hazardous waste management facility at its beaverton  oregon campus 
if tektronix fails to comply with any present or future regulations  the company could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its facilities or could require tektronix to acquire costly equipment  or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
sony tektronix corporation acquisition acquisition of sony corporation s interest in sony tektronix corporation was completed at the end of september upon completion of the transaction  the company s ownership of sony tektronix increased from to  and the company is now exposed to a greater financial impact from sony tektronix operations located in japan 
in addition  operation of sony tektronix as a wholly owned business involves additional risks  including integration costs and risks following the acquisition and the risks of doing business as a foreign owner in japan 
possible volatility of stock price the price of the company s common stock may be subject to wide  rapid fluctuations 
such fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company  such as changes in operating results or changes in analysts estimates regarding earnings 
fluctuations in the stock price may also be due to factors relating to the telecommunications  semiconductor  and computer industries or to the securities markets in general 
fluctuations in the stock price have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded 
shareholders should be willing to incur the risk of such fluctuations 
other risk factors other risk factors include but are not limited to changes in the mix of products sold  regulatory and tax legislation  changes in effective tax rates  inventory risks due to changes in market demand or the company s business strategies  potential litigation and claims arising in the normal course of business  credit risk of customers  the fact that a substantial portion of the company s sales are generated from orders received during each quarter and other risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  including interest rate  equity price and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the company maintains a short term and long term investment portfolio consisting of fixed rate commercial paper  corporate notes and bonds  asset backed securities and mortgage securities 
the weighted average maturity of the portfolio  excluding mortgage securities  is two years or less 
mortgage securities may have a weighted average life of less than seven years and are managed consistent with the lehman mortgage index 
an increase in interest rates of similar instruments would decrease the value of certain of these investments 
a adverse change in interest rates would reduce the market value by million  which would be reflected in other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until sold 
at may   the company s bond debt obligation had a fixed interest rate 
the fair value of the bond debt instrument at may  was million compared to the carrying value of million 
the company s bank loan obligation has a variable interest rate 
the fair value of the bank loan approximates the carrying value of million 
a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates would have a million negative impact on the combined fair value  which would not be reflected in the company s financial statements 
the company is exposed to equity price risk primarily through its marketable equity securities portfolio  including investments in merix corporation  tut systems  inc  and other companies 
the company has not entered into any hedging programs to mitigate equity price risk 
in management s opinion  an adverse change of in the value of these securities would reduce the market value by million  which would be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until sold 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through acquisitions and commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
the company utilizes derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts  generally with maturities of one to three months  to mitigate this risk where natural hedging strategies cannot be employed 
the company s policy is to only enter into derivative acquisitions when the company has an identifiable exposure to risk  thus not creating additional foreign currency exchange rate risk 
at may   the company held forward foreign currency exchange contracts in euros and canadian dollars with a notional amount totaling million 
the potential loss in fair value at may   for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in applicable foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures
