item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion presents management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
the company s results of operations depend primarily on i the level of oil and gas exploration and development activity of oil and gas companies in the gulf of mexico  offshore west africa  south and central america and the middle east  ii the company s ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements  and iii the company s ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends of oil and gas prices  exploration and production companies expectations of future oil and gas prices and changes in technology which reduce costs and improve expected returns on investment 
in addition  improvements in three dimensional seismic  directional drilling  production techniques and other advances in technology have increased drilling success rates and reduced costs 
although we believe our operations depend on these indicators  the correlation of those measures with our revenue is not direct as to timing and level 
oil and gas prices have remained high  but drilling activity has not increased and remains depressed as compared to activity levels at the end of and the beginning of during the years ended december  and  and transition   and  respectively  of the company s revenue was derived from projects fabricated for installation in international areas  with the remainder designed for installation in the gulf of mexico 
the company believes that its strong presence in both overseas markets and the gulf of mexico market historically enabled it to remain competitive and obtain fabrication work worldwide 
the midland transaction in april the company entered into an agreement with midland fabricators and process systems  llc as a result of which  among other things  midland acquired the rights of the company s lenders under the company s senior secured credit agreement 
on august   pursuant to the agreement with midland  midland exchanged million outstanding under the company s senior secured credit agreement and million in acquired claims of unsecured creditors for shares of our preferred stock  a secured subordinated convertible debenture in the amount of million and two secured subordinated notes which total in the aggregate million 
the debenture is convertible into the company s common stock at a price of per share 
midland s shares of preferred stock will be convertible into a total of  shares of the company s common stock as soon as the shareholders authorize additional shares of common stock 
the company also recorded additional paid in capital on the transaction of million resulting from the discount recorded on the secured subordinated convertible debenture  and capital contributions of  resulting from forgiveness by midland of penalties accrued under the senior secured credit agreement and  resulting from partial forgiveness of the unsecured creditor claims acquired by midland 
further   of the amount the company owed midland under the company s senior secured credit agreement was cancelled in exchange for the assignment to midland of certain accounts 
on november   the company entered into a commercial business loan with the whitney national bank  as more fully described below under the caption liquidity and capital resources 
this loan is guaranteed by nassau holding company  an affiliate of midland  the subsidiaries of unifab  and the principal members of midland  in accordance with the terms of the midland transaction 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  and year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to reduced barge and jack up rig repair operations and reduced newbuild liftboat activities resulting from the closure of the company s obi facilities at the port of iberia and the suspension of operations at its deepwater facility in lake charles 
current year revenue levels for the company s structural fabrication  process system design and fabrication services are approximately one third last year s revenues for those services 
throughout the current year  the company has experienced reduced opportunities to bid on projects and was eliminated from bidding on various projects as a result of the substantial deterioration of the company s financial condition and results of operations experienced during the fiscal year 
further  the company was unable to post sufficient collateral to secure performance bonds and as a result was unable to qualify to bid on various contracts 
at september   backlog was approximately million 
on august  the company completed a debt restructuring and recapitalization transaction with midland significantly improving the financial position  working capital and liquidity of the company 
additionally  midland added key management personnel  who are well known and respected throughout our industry 
since august   there has been a substantial increase in bidding activity in the company s main fabrication and process equipment markets 
in addition  the company s capacity to provide performance bonds on projects has improved significantly 
as a result  backlog at december  has increased to approximately million 
total direct labor hours worked decreased overall during the current year from the levels experienced in direct labor hours worked at the company s structural fabrication and process system design and fabrication facilities decreased by nearly from last year 
direct labor hours at the company s drilling rig fabrication facilities were eliminated with the closure of the obi facility and the suspension of operations at the lake charles facility 
cost of revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenue consists of costs associated with the fabrication process  including direct costs such as direct labor costs and raw materials and indirect costs that can be specifically allocated to projects such as supervisory labor  utilities  welding supplies and equipment costs 
this increase in costs as a percentage of revenue in the current year includes a  adjustment to workers comp insurance expense related to increased costs of claims incurred   depreciation of facilities and equipment at the lake charles facility at which operations have been suspended and the very low level of activity at the company s process equipment facility which did not generate sufficient profit margin to recover fixed operating costs 
in december the company executed contracts to fabricate two offshore platforms and recorded estimated loss reserves on those contracts of  these contracts were negotiated and executed during the time when the company s backlog was critically low 
management determined that the severely low level of fabrication work in backlog without these contracts would not support maintaining the skilled labor force in place  and losing that labor force would further delay any recovery for the company 
these contracts are scheduled for delivery in the march april  time frame 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  also includes a loss provision of  recorded on a fixed price contract to fabricate power plant components 
the contract for power plant components was completed and delivered in december cost of revenue for the year ended december  also includes losses of  on contracts to provide process equipment overseas 
the contracts are expected to be completed in the second quarter of included in cost of revenue for the year ended december  is an adjustment of  related to disputed billings on two contracts to manufacture derricks 
the company also recorded in cost of revenue a charge of  to write off uncompleted waste water tanks 
gross profit loss for the year ended december  decreased to a loss of million from a profit of million for the year ended december  in addition to the adjustments to increase cost of revenue described above  the decrease in gross profit is also due to costs in excess of revenue for the company s process system design and fabrication services and at the company s deep water facility in lake charles 
additionally  decreased man hour levels in the current year at the company s facilities compared to last year caused hourly fixed overhead rates to increase and resulted in increased costs relative to revenue 
the effect of these factors reducing gross profit in the year ended december  compared to last year was offset in part by a million contract loss reserve recorded last year 
other operating expenses in the year ended december  include an impairment loss of million on the lake charles facility 
operating losses incurred at the facility and the business outlook resulted in the company actively seeking alternative sources of capital to sustain development and operations at the facility 
by closing the midland transaction in august  the company was able to stabilize its overall financial condition and add experienced management to evaluate alternatives with respect to the lake charles facility 
since that time negotiations with possible joint venture partners that would operate the facility have been continuing 
in the event the company is unable to complete an arrangement whereby the facility can be operated  the company may sell the facility 
in evaluating the recoverability of the investment in the lake charles facility  the company estimated net undiscounted cash flows under both operating alternatives and disposal scenarios  and concluded the carrying value of the facility was impaired 
the company then estimated the fair value of the facility based on the related discounted estimated cash flows and based on this analysis recorded an impairment loss of million 
the impairment loss reduced the recorded net value of the facility to its estimated fair value of million 
other operating expenses also include  related to the transfer of ownership of the buildings and other leasehold improvements on the company s drilling rig repair facilities at the port of iberia in exchange for termination of the leases and cancellation of all amounts owed under those leases 
these losses were offset in part by a  gain recorded on the sale of assets used to provide maintenance and construction services to the chemical plant industry in the lake charles area 
in the year ended december  other operating expenses included the recording of million impairment charge on goodwill  million loss on the disposal of equipment and the shut down of the company s barge repair facility in new iberia  and the recording of  of commitment fees associated with the waiver and amendment to the company s secured credit agreement  which was executed april  these monthly fees were incurred as a result of the company being out of compliance with the terms of the waiver and amendment 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  this decrease is mainly due to reduced general and administrative expenses associated with closing the barge repair facilities in new iberia and the suspension of operations at the lake charles facility 
these cost reductions are offset in part with increased legal and other professional services due to the negotiations and documentation of the midland transaction and related regulatory issues 
in addition  the company has had to defend several lawsuits brought by unsecured creditors for amounts past due 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is  related to the termination and settlement of the employment contracts of two former executive officers of the company 
the company s selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in the year ended december  from last year  due mainly to the significant decrease in revenue levels relative to those periods 
interest expense for the year ended december  was lower than last year due to reduced effective interest rates in the current year 
additionally  million outstanding under the company s previous senior secured credit agreement was exchanged for preferred stock under the terms of the midland agreement  reducing the principal bearing interest 
this was offset in part by amortizing the discount recorded on the secured  subordinated debenture recorded on the midland transaction 
the company has recorded a million discount on the face value of the convertible debenture  which represents the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature of the debenture and equals the difference between  the conversion price per share  and  the closing price per share of unifab international  inc common stock on august   the date of issuance of the convertible debenture 
this discount is being amortized as interest expense from august  to august   the maturity date of the debenture 
in the year ended december   the company recorded  interest expense related to amortization of this discount 
no income tax expense was recognized in the year ended december  compared to income tax expense of million in the year ended december  in accordance with fas  the company considered that it had a cumulative pre tax loss for recent years  to be carried forward and used to offset future taxable income 
the ability of the company to utilize net operating loss carryforwards is also limited on an annual basis because the transaction with midland described above results in a change in control under the current tax regulations 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance to fully offset deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities  including fully reserving the deferred tax asset related to operating loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance reflects the company s judgment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company believes that the remaining deferred tax assets at december  are realizable 
management will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance 
comparison of the year ended december  and year ended december  unaudited during the year ended december   the company s revenue was million  a increase from the million revenue in the year ended december  this increase was mainly caused by increases in manhours worked at the company s deep water facility in lake charles  which revenue increased to million in the year ended december  in addition  pricing in the structural fabrication business improved slightly in compared to the prior year 
volume in the company s international process systems business was million  an increase of over the prior year 
these increases were offset in part by approximately reductions in the domestic process systems and barge repair revenue to million in the year ended december  direct labor hours worked in all facilities was approximately the same in the year ended december  as in the year ended december  cost of revenue was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  cost of revenue consists of costs associated with the fabrication process  including direct costs such as direct labor costs and raw materials and indirect costs that can be specifically allocated to projects such as supervisory labor  utilities  welding supplies and equipment costs 
the decrease in cost as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december   was mainly due to improved margins in structural fabrication offset in part by costs in excess of revenue at the company s deep water facility in lake charles  where the company incurred cost overruns on two jack up repair projects which were the first substantial projects at the facility 
the company also recorded contract loss reserves of million on a first of a kind liftboat being constructed in the company s barge repair facility in new iberia 
other operating expenses in the year ended december  included the recording of a million impairment charge on goodwill  a million loss on the disposal of equipment and the shut down of the company s barge repair facility in new iberia  and the recording of  of commitment fees associated with the waiver and amendment to the company s secured credit agreement  which was executed april  these monthly fees were incurred as a result of the company being out of compliance with the terms of the waiver and amendment 
sg a costs were lower in the year ended december  compared to the same period in both in gross dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
this decrease reflects the shut down of the company s barge repair facility in new iberia  which had been underutilized  overall consolidation of support functions and staff reductions in both new iberia and lake charles  mainly in the december quarter of in addition  was negatively impacted by the write off of a  receivable from a customer who filed for bankruptcy under chapter in the december quarter  we collected million on a receivable that had been written off in the september quarter 
depreciation and amortization in the year ended december  was million compared to million in the year ended december  depreciation increased to million in the year ended december  due mainly to the commencement of operations at the lake charles facility 
this increase was offset by a decrease in amortization expense as a result of the write off in september of substantially all of the company s recorded goodwill 
interest expense increased in the year ended december  to million from million in the increase is the result of the company being out of compliance with the terms of the credit agreement  which resulted in increased interest margins being paid on amounts outstanding under the agreement 
income tax expense of million was recognized in the year ended december  compared to an income tax benefit of million in the year ended december  the company recorded an income tax provision of million in the september quarter to establish a valuation allowance against the company s net deferred tax assets 
in accordance with fas  the company considered that it had a cumulative pre tax loss for recent years and revised its judgment about the realization of the deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance reflects the company s judgment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company believes that the remaining deferred tax assets at december  are realizable 
liquidity and capital resources historically the company has funded its business activities through funds generated from operations  short term borrowings on its revolving credit facilities for working capital needs and individual financing arrangements for equipment  facilities improvements  insurance premiums  and long term needs

in april  the company entered into a preferred stock purchase  debt exchange and modification agreement with midland the midland agreement 
pursuant to the midland agreement and with the company s consent  midland acquired the rights of the lenders under the credit agreement dated november   as amended  with bank one  louisiana  na and three other commercial banks

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and long lived assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue from construction contracts  which are typically of short duration  are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by relating actual labor cost  labor and subcontract cost  or total contract costs for work performed to date to the estimated total labor cost  total labor and subcontract cost or total contract cost of the respective contract 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  and repairs 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
significant changes in cost estimates due to adverse market conditions or poor contract performance could affect estimated gross profit  possibly resulting in a contract loss 
the company s customers are principally major and large independent oil and gas companies and drilling companies 
these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable are evaluated periodically against specific accounts that are known to be uncollectible 
increases in the reserves for uncollectible accounts are charged to operating results in the period they are identified 
receivables are generally not collateralized 
significant adverse changes in the economic environment of the oil and gas industry could result in materially lower collectibility of recorded receivables and could require a charge for uncollectible accounts in the future 
long lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values can be recovered through projected net cash flows undiscounted  based on expected operating results over their remaining lives 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its fair market value  or if fair market value is not readily determinable  to its estimated discounted net cash flows 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
income taxes have been provided using the liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the amount of future income tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  the likelihood of future taxable income and tax planning strategies when making this assessment 
based on this assessment  the company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that are more likely than not unrealizable 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the future if taxable income is not available to allow for the deduction of the deferred tax assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the risk of changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest or currency risks 
interest on approximately million  substantially all of the company s debt  was variable  based on short term interest rates 
a general increase of short term market interest rates would result in additional interest cost of  per year if the company were to maintain the same debt level and structure 
the company has a subsidiary located in the united kingdom for which the functional currency is the british pound 
the company typically does not hedge its foreign currency exposure 
historically  fluctuations in british pound us dollar exchange rates have not had a material effect on the company 
future changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar to the british pound may positively or negatively impact earnings  however  due to the size of its operations in the united kingdom  the company does not anticipate its exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations to be material in while the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments  it may use them in the future if deemed appropriate
