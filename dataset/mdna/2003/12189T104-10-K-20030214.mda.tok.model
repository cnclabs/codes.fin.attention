item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation and legislation rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board stb of the united states department of transportation dot  the federal railroad administration of dot  the occupational safety and health administration osha  and state regulatory agencies 
the stb has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates  routes and services  the sale or abandonment of rail lines  applications for line extensions and construction  and consolidation or merger with  or acquisition of control of  rail common carriers 
the outcome of stb proceedings can affect the costs and profitability of bnsf s business 
dot and osha have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations 
state agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law 
bnsf railway s rail operations  as well as those of its competitors  are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental regulation 
these laws cover discharges to waters  air emissions  toxic substances  and the generation  
table of contents handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials 
this regulation has the effect of increasing the cost and liabilities associated with rail operations 
environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations  which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials 
many of bnsf railway s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property 
as a result  bnsf railway is now subject and will from time to time continue to be subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions 
in particular  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law  generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on current and former owners and operators of a site 
accordingly  bnsf railway may be responsible under cercla and other federal and state statutes for all or part of the costs to cleanup sites at which certain substances may have been released by bnsf railway  its current lessees  former owners or lessees of properties  or other third parties 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
competition the business environment in which bnsf railway operates remains highly competitive 
depending on the specific market  deregulated motor carriers  other railroads and river barges may exert pressure on price and service levels 
the presence of advanced  high service truck lines with expedited delivery  subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non bulk  time sensitive freight 
the potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads 
in order to remain competitive  bnsf railway and other railroads strive to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity 
as railroads streamline  rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises  competition among rail carriers intensifies 
bnsf railway s primary rail competitor in the western region of the united states is the union pacific railroad company up 
other class i railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by bnsf railway 
based on reporting to the association of american railroads  in  bnsf s share of the western united states rail traffic was approximately percent 
item legal proceedings ray ridgeway  et al 
v 
burlington northern santa fe corporation and the burlington northern and santa fe railway company  no 
district court of tarrant county  texas  th judicial district is a state court action filed on october  the plaintiffs causes of action include alleged breach of contract  negligence  and breach of fiduciary duties with respect to a special dividend that was paid in by a burlington northern santa fe corporation bnsf predecessor  santa fe southern pacific corporation sfsp 
the complaint alleges that sfsp erroneously informed shareholders as to the tax treatment of the dividend specifically  the apportionment of the dividend as either a distribution of earnings and profits or a return of capital which allegedly caused some shareholders to overpay their income taxes 
the plaintiffs assert through their expert s report  that sfsp had essentially no accumulated earnings and profits and that the entire dividend distribution should have been treated as a return of capital  rather than the approximately percent that sfsp determined was a return of capital 
plaintiffs have a motion pending to certify a class of former sfsp shareholders which bnsf has opposed  but a decision on class certification issues is not expected until the second quarter of bnsf believes these claims lack merit and that it has substantial defenses on both the merits of these claims and the attempted class action  and it is defending these claims vigorously 
bnsf and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of legal actions and claims  various governmental proceedings and private civil suits arising in the ordinary course of business  including those related to environmental matters  federal employers liability act claims by bnsf railway employees  other personal injury claims  and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges including complaints seeking refunds of prior charges paid for coal transportation and the prescription of future rates for such movements 
some of the legal proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages  and a few proceedings purport to be class actions 
while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance  it is the opinion of bnsf s management that none of these items  when finally resolved  will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial position or liquidity of bnsf  although an adverse resolution of a number of these items could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year

truckload revenues were up due to strong growth from the company s primary accounts and modal conversion of highway traffic from new and existing shippers 
the reduction in revenue per car unit is related to a decrease in automotive traffic and an increase in international traffic  which primarily moves in containers and unit trains  and due to the lower cost structure  moves at lower rates per unit 
coal revenues of  million for decreased million  or percent  versus volume was lower than primarily as a result of reduced demand in the first half of caused by mild winter weather

industrial products revenues of  million for were million  or percent  lower than an increase in the chemicals and plastics sector tied to strength in automotive and home construction along with a new contract was more than offset by general softness in the petroleum  building and construction product sectors 
petroleum was down due to higher heating fuel inventories as a result of the mild winter 
building and construction product sectors were down primarily due to weak paper and steel markets 

table of contents agricultural products revenues of  million for were million  or percent  lower than revenues for primarily due to decreased soybean  wheat and corn exports due to global market conditions 
the decrease in export traffic resulted in lower revenue per unit due to a shorter length of haul 
domestic corn shipments to feedlots were also down from due to reduced feedlot demand  high inventory levels remaining from shipments and crop production conditions 
expenses year ended december  in millions compensation and benefits purchased services depreciation and amortization equipment rents fuel materials and other total operating expenses interest expense other expense  net total operating expenses for were  million  a decrease of million  or percent  over primarily due to a lower total cost per gallon of diesel fuel  lower equipment rents expense driven by an initiative to use less foreign equipment and increased gains on property dispositions 
compensation and benefits expenses of  million were million  or percent  higher than primarily due to increases in health and welfare costs  principally due to an increase in rates  incentive compensation  and pension expense primarily reflecting a decrease in the long term rate of return assumption for pension assets 
these increases were partially offset by reduced labor expenses as a result of lower employment levels 
purchased services of  million for were million  or percent  higher than due to a one time flood related recovery and higher other recoveries in  higher insurance expense in  as well as higher service contracts expense related to an agreement to outsource the management of a large portion of bnsf s information technology infrastructure

coal revenues of  million for decreased million from revenues of  million 
the decrease in revenues was primarily a result of lower revenue per car on certain contract renewals  partially offset by a percent increase in coal tons shipped due to colder weather  tight eastern coal supplies and high natural gas prices 
industrial products revenues of  million for were million  or percent  lower than  despite increased revenue per car as a result of selected price increases and increased length of haul

in addition  scheduled wages were significantly higher in the first and second quarters as a result of more severe weather conditions requiring increased maintenance and additional crews 
these increases were partially offset by lower employment levels 
purchased services of  million for were million  or percent  higher than due to higher ramping expenses incurred as a result of new services added which improve efficiency and safety at the intermodal ramp facilities  decreased recoveries as compared with the prior year  increased legal expense primarily related to coal rate disputes  higher contract equipment maintenance costs due to more locomotives under maintenance contracts  increased haulage expense  and increased other expenses as a result of flooding in the upper midwest in the early part of the year partially offset by a one time flood related recovery 
depreciation and amortization expenses of million for were million  or percent  higher than primarily due to a higher capital base 
equipment rents expenses for of million were million lower than reflecting reduced equipment levels  including cars  trailers  containers and automotive equipment

liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operations is bnsf s principal source of liquidity 
bnsf generally funds any additional liquidity requirements through debt issuance including commercial paper  through the leasing of assets and through the sale of a portion of its accounts receivable 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  million during compared with  million during the decrease in cash from operations is primarily due to changes in working capital  partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes during which includes the impact of the economic stimulus act 
investing activities net cash used for investing activities was  million during compared with  million during the decrease in cash used for investing activities is primarily due to a reduction in capital spending partially offset by the timing of equipment and other financing activity 
a breakdown of cash capital expenditures during  and is set forth in the following table year ended december  in millions maintenance of way mechanical information services other total maintenance of business expansion and other total bnsf has agreed to acquire locomotives by through december   bnsf has acquired of the locomotives 
all acquired locomotives were financed through operating leases  and the remaining locomotives under this agreement will be financed from one or a combination of sources including  but not limited to  cash from operations  
table of contents capital or operating leases  and debt issuances 
the decision on the method used for particular acquisition financings will depend upon then current market conditions and other factors 
in january  bnsf purchased another locomotives under the commitment discussed above 
the additional locomotives were initially funded with cash from operations  and the company will consider various financing alternatives  with financing  if appropriate  expected to be completed in financing activities net cash used for financing activities during was million primarily related to common stock repurchases of million  a net reduction in borrowings of million and dividend payments of million  partially offset by proceeds of million resulting from the exercise of million stock options 
aggregate debt to mature in is million 
bnsf s ratio of total net debt to total capital net debt is calculated as total debt less cash was percent at december   compared with percent at december   and percent at december  in january  the company exercised an option to call million of percent mortgage bonds issued by a predecessor company and due january  cash generated from operations was used to fund the call 
the company financed the construction of an intermodal facility by a third party and entered into an agreement to lease the intermodal facility for years 
this lease transaction is accounted for as a financing and has a purchase option 
the company recorded an asset in property and equipment  net and a liability in long term debt and commercial paper of million which represents the fair market value at lease inception 
bnsf issued million of percent notes due july  the net proceeds of the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper

at december   the entire billion was still available for future debt issuances 
bnsf issued million of percent notes due july  the net proceeds of the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper 
remarketable year bonds totaling million issued in were called by the holder of the call option 
bnsf subsequently purchased the option from the holder and retired the bonds and  as a result  incurred an expense of million

total repurchases through december   were million shares at a total average cost of per share  leaving million shares available for repurchase out of the million shares presently authorized 
long term debt and other obligations the company s business is capital intensive 
bnsf has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operating activities which it uses to fund capital additions  service debt  repurchase shares and pay dividends 
additionally  the company relies on access to the debt and leasing markets to finance a portion of capital additions on a long term basis 
the company utilizes a commercial paper program backed by bank revolving credit agreements to manage liquidity needs 
the information below summarizes the more significant obligations of the company at december  for and the foreseeable future  the company expects that cash from operating activities  access to capital markets and bank revolving credit agreements will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its obligations when due 
the company believes these sources of funds will also be sufficient to fund capital additions that are necessary to maintain its competitiveness and position the company for future revenue growth 
the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges was times for the year ended december  additionally  the company s ratio of net cash provided by operating activities divided by total average debt was percent for the year ended december  the following table summarizes the company s obligations under long term debt and other contractual commitments at december  payments due by period long term commitments total year or less years years there after in millions long term debt a capital lease obligations operating leases b employee merger and separation payments other long term commitments c total long term commitments a excludes capital lease obligations b gross payments due which include an interest component c includes short line minimum usage commitments  asset maintenance and other purchase commitments in august  bnsf entered into a year agreement to outsource the management of a large portion of its computing infrastructure 
the agreement is designed to reduce the cost of infrastructure services while maintaining or improving service levels and expertise 
the agreement is expected to result in slightly higher operating expenses for the next two fiscal years  although  over the term of the agreement  it is expected to slightly lower operating expenses and to reduce capital spending which in total is expected to generate positive cash flow 
the resulting minimum payments from this agreement are included in other long term commitments in the table above 
in addition to the obligations described above  the company acts as guarantor for certain debt and lease obligations of others 
bnsf does not expect performance under these guarantees to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity in the foreseeable future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into long term contractual requirements for future goods and services needed for the operations of the business 
such commitments are not in excess of expected requirements and are not reasonably likely to result in performance penalties or payments that would have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity 

table of contents credit agreements bnsf issues commercial paper from time to time that is supported by bank revolving credit agreements 
outstanding commercial paper balances are considered as reducing the amount of borrowings available under these agreements 
the bank revolving credit agreements allow borrowings of up to billion 
in june  the company reduced its billion short term facility to million and extended its expiration date to june the company has the ability to have any amounts then outstanding mature as late as june the remaining million commitments of the lenders under the long term facility are scheduled to expire in june annual facility fees are currently percent and percent for the short term and long term facilities  respectively 
both rates are subject to change based upon changes in bnsf s senior unsecured debt ratings 
borrowing rates are based upon i libor plus a spread determined by bnsf s senior unsecured debt ratings  ii money market rates offered at the option of the lenders  or iii an alternate base rate 
the company classifies commercial paper as long term to the extent of its borrowing capacity under these facilities 
the maturity value of commercial paper outstanding as of december  was million  reducing the total capacity available under the revolving credit agreements to approximately  million 
included in the million maturity value of commercial paper is million issued to a consolidated subsidiary of bnsf that is eliminated upon consolidation 
the revolving credit agreements include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility  including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth test  a maximum debt to capital test  and a million cross default provision 
at december   the company was in compliance with its debt covenants 
bnsf s tangible net worth is billion greater than the minimum consolidated tangible net worth required under the agreement  and the maximum debt to capital test provides approximately billion of debt capacity above bnsf s outstanding debt as of december   before an event of default would occur under these covenants 
with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency  any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreements 
a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency would be considered an immediate termination event 
sale of accounts receivable the accounts receivable sales program of santa fe receivables corporation sfrc  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  includes various provisions that  if triggered  would allow the investors participating in this program  at their option  to cancel the program 
these provisions include a minimum consolidated tangible net worth test and a maximum debt to capital test which are the same as in the bnsf revolving credit agreements discussed above 
at december   investor interests of million  net of million of excess cash held in the trust  were outstanding under the million accounts receivable facility 
sfrc renewed the receivables facility  effective in june  for an additional days 
the commitment of the investors to purchase undivided interests under the a r sales program is currently scheduled to expire in june management expects to be able to either extend the commitment of the current investors under the a r sales program past june or to find additional investors in the a r sales program who will be committed to purchase undivided interests after june pension funding the company anticipates contributing million to the company s qualified bnsf retirement plan in related to the plan year ending in and  depending on the future performance of the investment markets  could make up to an additional million contribution in related to the plan year ending in due to the uncertainty of the future performance of the investment markets  it is not practical to provide an outlook beyond however  if the investment markets remain soft in future years  additional future contributions may be necessary and could be significant 
minimum pension liability bnsf recorded an additional minimum pension liability related to the company s qualified bnsf retirement plan and nonqualified bnsf supplemental retirement plan of million and a corresponding non cash charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of million  net of million tax  in december this brings the total minimum pension liability to million at december  the additional minimum pension liability adjustment was primarily driven by lower asset returns in the investment markets over the last few years 

table of contents inflation due to the capital intensive nature of bnsf s business  the full effect of inflation is not reflected in operating expenses because depreciation is based on historical cost 
an assumption that all operating assets were depreciated at current price levels would result in substantially greater expense than historically reported amounts 
other matters employee merger and separation costs employee merger and separation costs activity was as follows in millions beginning balance at january  accruals payments other ending balance at december  employee merger and separation liabilities of million and million are included in the consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively  and principally represent i employee related severance costs for the consolidation of clerical functions  material handlers in mechanical shops and trainmen on reserve boards  ii deferred benefits payable upon separation or retirement to certain active conductors  trainmen and locomotive engineers  and iii certain non union employee severance costs 
employee merger and separation expenses are recorded in materials and other in the consolidated income statements 
at december   million of the remaining liabilities are included in current liabilities for anticipated costs to be paid in during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million charge for workforce reduction related costs which resulted in million being recorded in employee merger and separation costs 
conductors  trainmen and locomotive engineers liabilities related to deferred benefits payable upon separation or retirement to certain active conductors  trainmen and locomotive engineers were million and million at december  and  respectively 
these costs were primarily incurred in connection with labor agreements reached prior to the consummation of the business combination of bnsf s predecessor companies burlington northern inc and santa fe pacific corporation the merger which  among other things  reduced train crew sizes and allowed for more flexible work rules 
in  the company recorded a million reversal of certain deferred benefits payable to reflect a change in estimates 
in the second quarter of  the company incurred million of costs for severance  medical and other benefit costs for approximately trainmen on reserve boards 
all remaining payments were made in consolidation of clerical functions liabilities related to the consolidation of clerical functions were million and million at december  and  respectively  and primarily provide for severance costs associated with the clerical consolidation plan adopted in upon the merger 
the consolidation plan resulted in the elimination of approximately  permanent positions and was substantially completed during in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million of costs related to the reduction of approximately material handlers and other clerical positions 
in the second quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million for severance  medical and other benefit costs related to approximately material handlers in mechanical shops 
in  and  the company recorded million  million and million  respectively  of reversals for certain liabilities associated with the consolidation of clerical functions 
these reversals primarily reflect accrued payments related to workforce reductions for positions under collective bargaining agreements where the company was able to place affected individuals in alternate positions 
the remaining liability balance at december   represents benefits to be paid to affected employees who did not receive lump sum payments  but instead will be paid over five to ten years or in some cases through retirement 

table of contents non union employee severance liabilities principally related to certain remaining non union employee severances resulting from the fourth quarter workforce reduction  the second quarter reorganization  and the merger were million and million at december  and  respectively 
these costs will be paid over the next several years based on deferral elections made by the employees 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reduced positions through severance  normal attrition and the elimination of contractors 
the company recorded million of expenses for severance  medical and other benefits associated with the costs of terminating employees and approximately million for benefits to be received under the company s retirement and medical plans 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million related to this program as a result of higher costs than originally estimated 
substantially all of these planned reductions were completed at december  in the second quarter of  the company incurred million of costs for severance  medical and other benefit costs for ten involuntarily terminated non union positions 
these planned reductions were completed at december  hedging activities on january   bnsf adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and recorded a cumulative transition benefit of million  net of tax  to accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
the standard requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for documentation and measurement of hedging activities 
the company currently uses derivatives to hedge against increases in diesel fuel prices and interest rates as well as to convert a portion of its fixed rate long term debt to floating rate debt 
the company formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for the use of the hedging instrument 
this documentation includes linking the derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet  commitments or forecasted transactions 
the company assesses at the time a derivative contract is entered into  and at least quarterly  whether the derivative item is effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas no 
 is recognized in current period earnings 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recorded in aoci as a separate component of stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedge transaction affects earnings 
bnsf monitors its hedging positions and credit ratings of its counterparties and does not anticipate losses due to counterparty nonperformance 
fuel fuel costs represented  and percent of total operating expenses during  and  respectively 
due to the significance of diesel fuel expenses to the operations of bnsf and the historical volatility of fuel prices  the company maintains a program to hedge against fluctuations in the price of its diesel fuel purchases 
the intent of the program is to protect the company s operating margins and overall profitability from adverse fuel price changes by entering into fuel hedge instruments based on management s evaluation of current and expected diesel fuel price trends 
however  to the extent the company hedges portions of its fuel purchases  it may not realize the impact of decreases in fuel prices 
conversely  to the extent the company does not hedge portions of its fuel purchases  it may be adversely affected by increases in fuel prices 
based on fuel consumption during and excluding the impact of the hedging program  each one cent increase in the price of fuel would result in approximately million of additional fuel expense on an annual basis 
the fuel hedging program includes the use of derivatives that are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as of december   bnsf had entered into fuel swap and costless collar agreements utilizing west texas intermediate crude oil wti 
the hedge prices do not include taxes  transportation costs  certain other fuel handling costs  and any differences which may occur between the prices of wti and the purchase price of bnsf s diesel fuel  including refining costs 
the sum of all such costs typically ranges between and cents per gallon

labor approximately percent of bnsf railway s employees are union represented 
bnsf railway s union employees work under collective bargaining agreements with different labor organizations 
the negotiating process for new  major collective bargaining agreements covering all of bnsf railway s union employees has been underway since the bargaining round was initiated november  wages  health and welfare benefits  work rules  and other issues have traditionally been addressed through industry wide negotiations 
these negotiations have generally taken place over a number of months and have previously not resulted in any extended work stoppages 
the existing agreements have remained in effect and will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the railway labor act s procedures which include mediation  cooling off periods  and the possibility of presidential intervention are exhausted 
the current agreements provide for periodic wage increases until new agreements are reached 
the national carriers conference committee nccc  bnsf s multi employer collective bargaining representative  reached a final agreement in august  with the united transportation union utu covering wage  work rule  and locomotive remote control issues through the year for conductors  brakemen  yardmen  yardmasters and firemen  which represent approximately one third of bnsf s unionized workforce 
the new agreement also creates a final and binding process for resolving health and welfare issues  mainly involving employees sharing in rising benefit costs 
the agreement commits each side to participate in a study and negotiation period  during which the parties will examine alternative ways to control rising healthcare costs 
the parties have scheduled meetings on this issue in the first quarter of failing these efforts  either party could send unresolved health and welfare issues to final and binding arbitration 
the nccc has also reached a final agreement with the transportation communications union tcu providing for final and binding arbitration of wage and benefit issues through this agreement averts the possibility of self help by the parties over bargaining round issues 
the arbitrator conducted hearings in the case commencing january   and issued a final and binding decision on january  the arbitration result settles all wage  work rule and medical benefit issues between the parties through tcu represents bnsf s clerks  carmen and patrolmen  who make up about percent of bnsf s unionized workforce 
in october  the nccc and international brotherhood of boilermakers and blacksmiths ibb made a final agreement resolving wage and work rule issues through  but leaving health and welfare benefit issues to be settled based on the outcome of the bargaining round process with other rail labor unions 
ibb represents around bnsf employees  less than percent of the unionized workforce 

table of contents in spring  the nccc and brotherhood of maintenance of way employes bmwe reached an agreement resolving wage  work rule and benefit issues through  which was implemented in july bmwe represents bnsf s track  bridge and building maintenance employees  or about one fifth of bnsf s unionized workforce 
in june  the nccc reached a tentative agreement with the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew  which represents approximately percent of bnsf s unionized workforce  addressing wage and work rule issues through  but leaving health and welfare benefit issues for settlement in separate talks with other railroad unions 
ibew members failed to ratify the tentative agreement 
along with four other major railroads  bnsf reached agreement with the brotherhood of locomotive engineers ble and utu to arbitrate labor agreement issues raised by ble stemming from the railroads implementation of locomotive remote control technology and assignment of remote control operations to employees represented by utu 
the arbitration board decided the case on january   sustaining the railroads right to assign remote control locomotive operations in and around terminals to ground service employees represented solely by utu 
the decision is final and binding on all parties 
railroad industry personnel are covered by the railroad retirement system instead of social security 
bnsf railway s contributions under the railroad retirement system have been approximately triple those in industries covered by social security 
the railroad retirement system  funded primarily by payroll taxes on covered employers and employees  includes a benefit roughly equivalent to social security tier i  an additional benefit similar to that allowed in some private defined benefit plans tier ii  and other benefits 
investment of tier ii railroad retirement assets had  until  been limited to special interest bearing u 
s 
treasury securities 
the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act of act creates a new national railroad retirement investment trust to hold tier ii railroad retirement assets and empowers the trustees to invest these assets in the same types of investments available to private sector retirement plans 
in addition to liberalizing certain retirement benefit requirements for rail employees  the act reduced tier ii railroad retirement tax rates on rail employers beginning in and eliminated a supplemental annuity tax 
the company realized savings of approximately million in and expects to realize savings of million in future adjustments in the tier ii railroad retirement tax rates assessed will depend on railroad retirement fund levels  and annual savings could be as much as million by critical accounting estimates in the ordinary course of business  the company makes a number of estimates and assumptions related to reporting of the results of operations and financial position in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates described below with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
legal bnsf and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of legal actions and claims  various governmental proceedings and private civil suits arising in the ordinary course of business  including those related to environmental matters  federal employers liability act claims by bnsf railway employees  other personal injury claims  and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges including complaints seeking refunds of prior charges paid for coal transportation and the prescription of future rates for such movements 
some of the legal proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages  and a few proceedings purport to be class actions 
while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance  it is the opinion of bnsf s management that none of these items  when finally resolved  will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial position or liquidity of bnsf  although an adverse resolution of a number of these items could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year 
bnsf s most significant claims relate to environmental matters and personal injury 
these claims are discussed in more detail below 

table of contents environmental the company s operations  as well as those of its competitors  are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental regulation 
bnsf s operating procedures include practices to protect the environment from the risks inherent in railroad operations  which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials 
additionally  many of bnsf s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property 
as a result  bnsf is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions 
in particular  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  also known as the superfund law  as well as similar state laws generally impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct 
bnsf has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party prp for study and cleanup costs at approximately superfund sites for which investigation and remediation payments are or will be made or are yet to be determined the superfund sites and  in many instances  is one of several prps 
in addition  bnsf may be considered a prp under certain other laws 
accordingly  under cercla and other federal and state statutes  bnsf may be held jointly and severally liable for all environmental costs associated with a particular site 
if there are other prps  bnsf generally participates in the cleanup of these sites through cost sharing agreements with terms that vary from site to site 
costs are typically allocated based on relative volumetric contribution of material  the amount of time the site was owned or operated  and or the portion of the total site owned or operated by each prp 
environmental costs include initial site surveys and environmental studies of potentially contaminated sites as well as costs for remediation and restoration of sites determined to be contaminated 
liabilities for environmental cleanup costs are initially recorded when bnsf s liability for environmental cleanup is both probable and a reasonable estimate of associated costs can be made 
adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as necessary based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods 
bnsf conducts an ongoing environmental contingency analysis  which considers a combination of factors including independent consulting reports  site visits  legal reviews  analysis of the likelihood of participation in and the ability of other prps to pay for cleanup  and historical trend analyses 
environmental related expenses are a significant expense for bnsf and the railroad industry 
bnsf is involved in a number of administrative and judicial proceedings and other mandatory cleanup efforts at approximately sites  including the superfund sites  at which it is participating in the study or cleanup  or both  of alleged environmental contamination 
the company recognized environmental expenses of approximately million  million and million during  and  respectively 
bnsf paid approximately million  million and million during  and  respectively  for mandatory and unasserted claims cleanup efforts  including amounts expended under federal and state voluntary cleanup programs 
bnsf has recorded liabilities for remediation and restoration of all known sites of million at december   compared with million at december  of these amounts  million and million  respectively  are included in current liabilities 
bnsf s environmental liabilities are not discounted 
bnsf anticipates that the majority of the accrued costs at december   will be paid over the next five years and no individual site is considered to be material 
critical estimate liabilities recorded for environmental costs represent bnsf s best estimates for remediation and restoration of these sites and include both asserted and unasserted claims 
unasserted claims are not considered to be a material component of the liability 
although recorded liabilities include bnsf s best estimates of all costs  without reduction for anticipated recoveries from third parties  bnsf s total cleanup costs at these sites cannot be predicted with certainty due to various factors such as the extent of corrective actions that may be required  evolving environmental laws and regulations  advances in environmental technology  the extent of other parties participation in cleanup efforts  developments in ongoing environmental analyses related to sites determined to be contaminated  and developments in environmental surveys and studies of potentially contaminated sites 
as a result  future charges to income for environmental liabilities could have a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year as individual site studies and remediation and restoration efforts proceed or as new sites arise 
however  management believes it is unlikely any identified matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on bnsf s results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
the company has not materially changed its methodology for identifying and calculating environmental liabilities in the three years presented 
there are currently no known trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to occur and materially affect the methodology or assumptions described above 

table of contents personal injury personal injury claims  including work related injuries to employees  are a significant expense for the railroad industry 
employees of bnsf are compensated for work related injuries according to the provisions of the federal employers liability act fela 
fela s system of requiring the finding of fault  coupled with unscheduled awards and reliance on the jury system  contributed to significant increases in expense in past years 
bnsf has implemented a number of safety programs to reduce the number of personal injuries as well as the associated claims and personal injury expense 
the company recognized personal injury expenses of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
bnsf made payments for personal injuries of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
at december  and  the company had recorded liabilities of million and million  respectively  related to both asserted as well as unasserted personal injury claims 
of these amounts  million and million  respectively  are included in current liabilities 
bnsf s liabilities for both asserted and unasserted personal injury claims are undiscounted 
critical estimate the company uses a third party actuarial firm that performs actuarial reviews to assist the company in estimating the liabilities for asserted as well as fela and general liability related unasserted claims 
these estimates are based on the covered population  activity levels and trends in the frequency  and the costs of covered injuries 
personal injury liability and expense projections are estimated using standard actuarial methodologies 
the company has not materially changed its methodology for calculating personal injury liabilities in the three years presented 
there are currently no known trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to occur and materially affect the methodology or assumptions described above 
income taxes bnsf is subject to various federal  state and local income taxes in the taxing jurisdictions where the company operates 
bnsf accounts for income taxes by providing for taxes payable or refundable in the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in financial statements or tax returns 
bnsf recorded total income tax expense  including federal  state and other income taxes  of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
bnsf recorded million and million of net current deferred tax assets at december  and  respectively 
bnsf recorded  million and  million of net non current deferred tax liabilities at december  and  respectively 
classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities as current or noncurrent is determined by the financial statement classification of the asset or liability to which the temporary difference is related 
if a temporary difference is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting  it is classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
bnsf has not recorded a valuation allowance  as it believes that the deferred tax assets will be fully realized in the future 
the federal income tax returns of bnsf s predecessor companies  burlington northern  inc and santa fe pacific corporation are closed through and the merger date in september  respectively 
bnsf is currently under internal revenue service examination for years through in addition  bnsf and its subsidiaries have various state income tax returns in the process of examination  administrative appeal or litigation 
management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed for open years through critical estimate bnsf makes estimates of the potential liability based on its assessment of all potential tax exposures 
in addition  the company uses factors such as applicable law  current information  and past experience with similar issues to make these judgements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that apply to taxable income in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or paid 
changes in management s estimates regarding the statutory tax rate to be applied to the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities could materially affect the effective tax rate 
the actual effective tax rate for the years ended december   and  were percent  percent and percent  respectively 

table of contents the company has not materially changed its methodology for calculating income tax expense for the years presented and there are currently no known trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to occur and materially affect the methodology or assumptions described above 
pensions and other post employment benefits bnsf sponsors a funded  noncontributory qualified bnsf retirement plan  which covers substantially all non union employees and an unfunded  nonqualified bnsf supplemental retirement plan  which covers certain officers and other employees 
the benefits under these bnsf plans are based on years of credited service and the highest five year average compensation levels 
bnsf s funding policy is to contribute annually not less than the regulatory minimum and not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes with respect to the funded plan 
certain salaried employees of bnsf that have met certain age and years of service requirements are eligible for medical benefits and life insurance coverage during retirement 
the retiree medical plan is contributory and provides benefits to retirees  their covered dependents and beneficiaries 
retiree contributions are adjusted annually 
the plan also contains fixed deductibles  coinsurance and out of pocket limitations 
the basic life insurance plan is noncontributory and covers retirees only 
optional life insurance coverage is available for some retirees  however  the retiree is responsible for the full cost 
bnsf s policy is to fund benefits payable under the medical and life insurance plans as they come due 
employees beginning salaried employment with bnsf subsequent to september   are not eligible for medical benefits during retirement 
the company recorded a net pension benefit of million and million in and  respectively  and a net pension cost of million in at december  and  the company reported pension benefit obligations of  million and  million  respectively 
the company recorded a net other post employment benefits opeb cost of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december  and the company reported opeb benefit obligations of million and million  respectively 
critical estimate annual pension and opeb expenses are calculated by third party actuaries using standard actuarial methodologies 
the actuaries assist the company in making estimates based on historical information  current information and estimates about future events and circumstances 
significant assumptions used in the valuation of pension and opeb include expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of increase in compensation levels and the health care cost trend rate 
these assumptions are critical to the company s results and changes to these estimates could have a material impact on the company s results 
the discount rate is a component estimate of both pensions and opeb 
health care cost trend rates only affect opeb costs 
the expected return on plan assets is a factor that only influences the funded pension plans 
the third party actuaries use a discount rate that reflects the current bond market and an expected rate of return on assets that reflects the expected long term rates of return on plan assets 
from time to time  the company will change pension and opeb assumptions to better approximate current conditions 
general softness in the economy and the decline in the investment markets during and prompted bnsf to decrease the rate of return on plan assets from percent in to percent for the decrease in the assumed rate of return caused pension expense to increase by approximately million 
the discount rate has also been changed within the past three years 
for year end  the discount rate was reduced from percent to percent for both pension and opeb 
for year end  the discount rate was further reduced from percent to percent 
unforeseen changes in the investment markets or other external factors could prompt changes in these estimates 
depreciation due to the capital intensive nature of the railroad industry  depreciation expense is a significant component of the company s operating expense 
the company recorded depreciation and amortization expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december  and  the company had property and equipment  net balances of  million and  million which include  million and  million  respectively  of accumulated depreciation 

table of contents critical estimate the company uses the group method of depreciation under which a single depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property  despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class 
as required by the federal surface transportation board stb  the company conducts studies of depreciation rates and the required accumulated depreciation balance at least every three years for equipment property and at least every six years for track structure and other roadway property 
the company uses external consultants to conduct these studies 
the consultants rely on statistical analysis  historical retirement data  industry knowledge and discussions with management to assess the impact of new technologies and maintenance practices 
changes in the estimated service lives of the assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively and the difference between the calculated accumulated depreciation and the amount recorded is amortized over the average service lives of the assets 
adoption of new rates and amortization adjustments must be approved by the stb 
a study conducted in resulted in the company adopting new locomotive  freight car and other equipment and computer hardware and software depreciation rates that resulted in a net decrease in annual depreciation expense of million 
there have been no material changes in the depreciation rates in  or accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

while the standard will have no effect on the company s liquidity  it will result in a cumulative effect adjustment in the first quarter of which the company is currently quantifying along with the ongoing impact it will have on results of operations 
the company does not believe the standard will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  bnsf utilizes various financial instruments that inherently have some degree of market risk 
the qualitative and quantitative information presented in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and notes and of the consolidated financial statements describe significant aspects of bnsf s financial instrument programs which have a material market risk 
commodity price sensitivity bnsf has a program to hedge against fluctuations in the price of its diesel fuel purchases 
existing hedge transactions as of december   are based on the front month settlement price of west texas intermediate crude oil wti 
for swaps  bnsf either pays or receives the difference between the hedge price and the actual average price of the hedge commodity during a specified determination period for a specified number of gallons 
for costless collars  if the average hedge commodity price for a specified determination period is greater than the cap price  bnsf receives the difference for a specified number of gallons 
if the average commodity price is less than the floor price  bnsf pays the difference for a specified number of gallons 
if the commodity price is between the floor price and the cap price  bnsf neither makes nor receives a payment 
hedge transactions are generally settled with the counterparty in cash 
based on historical information  bnsf believes there is a significant correlation between the market prices for diesel fuel and wti

interest rate sensitivity from time to time  bnsf enters into various interest rate hedging transactions for purposes of managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and establishing rates in anticipation of future debt issuances as well as to convert a portion of its fixed rate long term debt to floating rate debt to manage its ratio of fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
bnsf s measurement of fair value of interest rate swaps and treasury locks is based on estimates of the mid market values for the transactions provided by the counterparties to these agreements 
as discussed in note in the consolidated financial statements  the company uses interest rate swaps and treasury locks to minimize exposure to risk 
these swaps and treasury locks are accounted for either as cash flow or fair value hedges as required under sfas no
