sources of funds the bank s primary source of funds for lending  investment and other general business purposes are deposit accounts 
we offer a full range of deposit services  including checking and other transaction accounts  savings accounts and time deposits 
in addition to deposits  another principal source of funds is loan repayments 
if necessary  additional funding is available to the bank by borrowing from the fhlb  which has been granted a blanket lien on our residential loan portfolio as collateral 
we have not relied on brokered deposits in the past and do not foresee a need to do so in the future 
to the extent that additional short term financing is required  we intend to rely on repurchase agreements and other traditional money market sources of funding 
the company does not currently maintain any lines of credit

supervision and regulation we are extensively regulated under both federal and state law 
the following is a brief summary of certain statutes  rules  and regulations affecting us 
this summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions referenced below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to our business 
supervision  regulation  and examination by the bank regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than stockholders 

table of contents regulation of the company we are a bank holding company registered with the federal reserve under the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhc act 
we are subject to the applicable provisions of the bhc act and the supervision  examination  and regulations of the federal reserve 
the bhc act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if  after such acquisition  the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than five percent of the voting shares of the bank  it or any of its subsidiaries  other than a bank  may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of the bank  or it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company 
similar federal statues require bank holding companies and other companies to obtain the prior approval of the office of thrift and supervision ots before acquiring ownership or control of a savings association 
the bhc act further provides that the federal reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the united states  or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country  or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade  unless the anti competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community served 
the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served 
considerations of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy  and consideration of convenience and needs issues includes the parties performance under the community reinvestment act of the cra 
the bhc act  as amended by the interstate banking provisions of the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate banking act  authorizes any bank holding company located in florida to acquire a bank located in any other state  and any bank holding company located outside florida may lawfully acquire any florida based bank  regardless of state law to the contrary  in either case subject to certain deposit percentage  aging requirements  and other restrictions 
the interstate banking act also generally provides that national and state chartered banks may branch interstate through acquisitions of banks in other states  unless a state has opted out of the interstate branching provisions of the interstate banking act prior to june  neither florida nor any other state in the southeastern united states has opted out 
accordingly  we would have the ability to acquire a bank in a state in the southeast and consolidate the newly acquired bank and the bank into a single bank with interstate branches 
the bhc act  as currently in effect  generally prohibits us from engaging in activities other than banking or managing or controlling banks or other permissible subsidiaries and from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect control of any company engaged in any activities other than those activities determined by the federal reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
in determining whether a particular activity is permissible  the federal reserve must consider whether the performance of such an activity reasonably can be expected to produce benefits to the public  such as greater convenience  increased competition  or gains in efficiency  that outweigh possible adverse effects  such as undue concentration of resources  decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest  or unsound banking practices 

table of contents the federal reserve has determined that  as a general matter  bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries may engage in  among other things  operating a thrift subsidiary  conducting discount securities brokerage activities  performing certain data processing services and acting as agent or broker in selling certain types of insurance in connection with credit transactions 
the bhc act does not place territorial limitations on permissible non banking activities of bank holding companies 
despite prior approval  the federal reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its non bank subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness  or stability of any bank subsidiary of the holding company 
under federal reserve policy  bank holding companies are expected to act as a source of financial strength and support to their subsidiary banks 
this support may be required at times when  absent such federal reserve policy  the holding company may not be inclined to provide it 
in addition  any capital loans by a bank holding company to any bank subsidiary are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank 
in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy  any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority payment 
the gramm leach bliley act the act amends the bhc act to authorize new financial holding companies fhc 
under the fhc provisions of the act  a bhc can qualify to become a fhc if all of its bank and thrift subsidiaries are well capitalized and well managed and have a cra rating of satisfactory or better 
once a bhc becomes a fhc  it is permitted to conduct any securities  insurance and merchant banking activities  as well as any other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to a financial activity  such as developing financial software  hosting internet web sites relating to financial matters and operating a travel agency 
under the regulatory structure prescribed by the act  the federal reserve acts as the umbrella regulator for the fhc  with each fhc subsidiary subject to supervision and regulation by its own functional regulator or agency 
the act also gives banks the option of conducting certain newly permitted financial activities in a subsidiary rather than using a fhc 
banks that satisfy the well capitalized  well managed and cra requirements applicable to fhcs will be able to establish financial subsidiaries that are permitted to conduct all financial activities as agency and some financial activities as principal such as securities underwriting 
the main activities in which financial subsidiaries currently are prohibited from engaging are insurance underwriting  real estate development and merchant banking 
regulation of the bank the bank is organized as a florida chartered commercial bank and is regulated and supervised by the department 
the fdic serves as its primary federal regulator and the administrator of the fund that insures the bank s deposits 
the department and the fdic conduct regular examinations  reviewing the adequacy of the loan loss reserves  quality of loans and investments  propriety of management practices  compliance with laws and regulations  and other aspects of operations 
in addition to these regular examinations  the bank must file quarterly reports containing detailed financial statements and schedules 
federal and florida banking laws and regulations govern all areas of the operations of the bank  including reserves  loans  mortgages  capital  issuances of securities  payment of dividends  and establishment of branches 
as its primary regulators  the department and the fdic have authority to impose penalties  initiate civil and administrative actions  and take other steps intended to prevent the bank from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices 
the bank is a member of the bank insurance fund bif and  as such  deposits in the bank are insured by the fdic to the maximum extent permissible by law 
the bank is subject to the provisions of the cra 
under the cra  the bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with their safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities  including low and moderate income individuals and neighborhoods 
the cra does 
table of contents not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit the bank s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to their particular communities  consistent with the cra 
the cra requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency in the case of the bank  the fdic in connection with their regular examinations  to assess a financial institution s record in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by it  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the evaluation focuses on three tests a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its service areas  an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  and a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches and other offices 
a federal banking agency s assessment of a financial institution s cra record is made available to the public 
further  such assessment is required whenever the institution applies to  among other things  establish a new branch that will accept deposits  relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with  or acquire the assets of or assume the liabilities of  a federally regulated financial institution 
in the case where the company applies for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company  the federal regulator approving the transaction will also assess the cra records of the bank 
the bank received a satisfactory cra rating in its most recent examination 
transactions with affiliates there are multiple restrictions on the extent to which the company and any future non bank subsidiary can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from the bank 
there are also restrictions on the bank s purchase of  or investment in  the securities or other assets of the company 
in the event such transactions are permissible  they must be on the same terms and circumstances  including credit standards  that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non affiliated companies 
deposit insurance the bank is subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments 
the bank is subject to a risk based assessment system for insured depository institutions that takes into account the risks attributable to different categories and concentrations of assets and liabilities 
this system assigns an institution to one of three capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  and undercapitalized 
an institution is also assigned  by the fdic  to one of three supervisory subgroups within each capital group 
the supervisory subgroup to which an institution is assigned is based on a supervisory evaluation provided to the fdic by the institution s primary federal regulator and information which the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance funds which may include  if applicable  information provided by the institution s state supervisor 
an institution s insurance assessment rate is then determined based on the capital category and supervisory category to which it is assigned  and attributed to the deposit insurance funds 
under the risk based assessment system  there are nine assessment risk classifications ie  combinations of capital groups and supervisory subgroups to which different assessment rates are applied 
assessment rates on deposits for an institution in the highest category ie  well capitalized and healthy are less than assessment rates on deposits for an institution in the lowest category ie  undercapitalized and substantial supervisory concern 
the bank  as a state chartered commercial bank  is a member of bif 
however as part of the acquisitions the bank has undertaken in the past  the bank acquired deposits previously insured by the savings association insurance fund the saif 
based on these acquisitions  the bank is required to pay insurance premiums to the fdic on a substantial portion of its deposits at the saif assessment rate notwithstanding its status as a bif member 
as of september   the most recent measurement date for assessment purposes  approximately of the bank s deposits were treated as saif insured deposits  with the remaining of deposits being assessed at the bif rate 
prior to enactment of the 
table of contents deposit insurance funds act of the funds act  only assessments against saif member institutions were available to pay interest on the so called fico bonds  which were issued by the financing corporation the fico in the late s to fund the resolution of troubled thrifts 
the funds act shifted a portion of the fico funding obligations to the bif member institutions beginning in through the end of  the fico assessment rate on bif assessable deposits was required by the statute to be one fifth of the saif rate 
beginning january   the fdic equalized the fico assessment rates for members of both insurance funds at percent 
in  the bank s total fico payment obligation was   of which was attributable to the bank s saif assessable deposits and the balance of which was attributable to its bif assessable deposits 
capital requirements we are required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve for the company  and the fdic for the bank 
the minimum capital requirements applicable to the company and the bank are essentially the same 
failure to meet capital guidelines could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies  including issuance of a capital directive  the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  a prohibition on the taking of brokered deposits  and certain other restrictions on our business  including growth and dividend restrictions 
substantial additional restrictions can be imposed upon us if we fail to meet applicable capital requirements under the federal prompt corrective action regulations 
as of december   the bank s capital ratios exceeded the minimum standards for a well capitalized bank  according to fdic guidelines 
for additional information regarding capital requirements applicable to the company and the bank and their compliance with such requirements see note regulatory capital requirements 
payment of dividends under federal law  if  in the opinion of the fdic  the bank is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which  depending on the financial condition of the depository institution  could include the payment of dividends  the fdic may require  after notice and hearing  that the bank cease and desist from such practice 
the federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies in december  the bank may not pay any dividend to the company if such payment would cause it to become undercapitalized 
as a florida chartered commercial bank  the bank is subject to florida statutes regarding payment of dividends 
under the florida financial institutions code  the prior approval of the department is required for dividend payment if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year will exceed the sum of a bank s net retained profits net income less any dividends paid for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two years 
as of january   the bank had a net retained profit for dividend payment purposes of  at december   the company had unrestricted cash available for debt service payments of million 
the company s annual debt service payments total million 
federal reserve system the federal reserve system is used primarily for the settlement of funds between member banks 
the federal reserve regulations require banks to maintain noninterest earning reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now and regular checking accounts 
the federal reserve board regulations  effective november   generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows for accounts aggregating million or less the reserve requirement is  and for accounts greater than million  the reserve requirement is against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of million 
the first million of otherwise reservable balances subject to adjustments by the federal reserve are exempted from the reserve 
table of contents requirements 
the balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the federal reserve may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the department 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash  a noninterest bearing account at a federal reserve bank or a pass through account as defined by the federal reserve  the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the bank s interest earning assets 
fhlb system members  including the bank  also are authorized to borrow from the federal reserve discount window  but federal reserve regulations require institutions to exhaust all fhlb sources before borrowing from a federal reserve bank 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb system 
the fhlb system  which consists of regional federal home loan banks is governed and regulated by the federal housing finance board the fhfb 
the fhlb provides a central credit facility for member institutions 
as a member of the fhlb  we are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb in an amount at least equal to the greater of one percent of the aggregate principal amount of our unpaid residential mortgage loans  home purchase contracts and similar obligations as of the close of each calendar year  or five percent of our borrowings from the fhlb including advances and letters of credit issued by the fhlb on our behalf 
the fhlb makes advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures periodically established by the fhfb and the board of directors of the fhlb 
currently  outstanding advances from the fhlb are required to be secured by a member s shares of stock in the fhlb and by certain types of mortgages and other assets 
interest rates charged for advances vary depending on maturity  the cost of funds to the fhlb and the purpose of the borrowing 
as of december   we had million of outstanding advances from the fhlb with an unused credit line totaling million 
liquidity under florida banking regulations  we are required to maintain a daily liquidity position equal to at least of our total transaction accounts and eight percent of our total non transaction accounts  less those deposits of public funds for which security has been pledged as provided by law 
we may satisfy our liquidity requirements with cash on hand including cash items in process of collection  deposits held with the federal reserve  demand deposits due from correspondent banks  federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits maturing in days or less and the market value of certain unencumbered  rated  investment grade securities and securities issued by florida or any county  municipality of other political subdivision within the state 
the department and fdic review our liquidity position as part of their examinations 
if we fail to comply with the liquidity requirements  we generally may not further diminish liquidity either by making any new loans other than by discounting or purchasing bills of exchange payable at sight or by paying dividends 
at december   using applicable florida regulations  the bank s liquidity position was million compared to a minimum position of million 
monetary policy and economic controls the banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary policies of the federal reserve 
changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing  availability of borrowing at the discount window  open market operations  the imposition of changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits and the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve 
the monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve are influenced by various factors  including inflation  unemployment  short and long term changes in the international trade balance and in the fiscal policies of the united states government 

table of contents future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and earnings of the bank cannot be predicted

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our critical accounting policies  balance sheets  statements of operations  off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial and other information  the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere therein 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was released by the securities and exchange commission  advises all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods we employ 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
republic s management has discussed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
fair value 
certain financial instruments are recorded at fair value  or  in the case of loan servicing rights and loans held for sale  at the lower of amortized cost or fair value 
unrealized gains and losses may be reflected in results of operations or as an adjustment to equity accounts as applicable 
the preferred method of determining fair value is through use of listed market prices  where possible  and we utilize those market quotes whenever available 
if listed market prices are not readily available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors and methods  including techniques using present value of cashflows 
in preparing fair values using methods other than listed market prices  we employ financial models to estimate those fair values 
those pricing models and their underlying assumptions determine the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
to the extent financial instruments have extended maturity dates  our estimates of fair value may involve greater subjectivity due to the lack of transparent market data available upon which to base modeling assumptions 
the illiquid nature of certain securities or debt instruments such as certain mortgage obligations and mortgage related loan products also requires a high degree of judgment in determining fair value 
the amount of assets on our balance sheet valued using pricing models comprises less than of total assets but the fluctuation in fair value caused by relatively minor changes in the underlying assumptions could result in a material change in the results of operations 
for an additional discussion regarding the calculation of fair value and the underlying assumptions used in those analyses  see note securities and note msrs and excess servicing interest only strips 
transfers of financial assets 
from time to time we may engage in securitization activities 
gains and losses from securitizations are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when we relinquish control of the transferred financial assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this is a replacement of the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
and other related pronouncements 
the gain or loss on the sale of financial assets depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of sale 
we recognize any interests in the transferred assets and any liabilities incurred in securitization transactions on the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value 
subsequently  changes in the fair value of interests accounted for as trading assets are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
for an additional discussion regarding the calculation of 
table of contents fair value and the underlying assumptions used in those analyses  see note to the consolidated financial statements securities and note to the consolidated financial statements msrs and excess servicing interest only strips 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses which is made to reserve for estimated losses in outstanding loan balances 
the allowance for loan losses represents republic s estimate of the probable losses that have occurred as of the date of the financial statements  as further described in note and note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  trends in actual and forecasted portfolio credit quality  including delinquency  charge off and bankruptcy rates  and current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to pay 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses in future periods may differ from provisions recorded during income taxes 
our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide a valuation allowance  if required 
our deferred tax asset at december  totaled million 
the company adopted the actual charge off method for recording loan loss provisions on our federal and state tax returns several years ago 
our allowance for loan losses  which totaled million at the end of  has resulted to a charge against earnings for financial reporting purposes but not for income tax purposes 
this factor accounted for of our deferred tax asset 
years ended december  and comparison of balance sheets at december  and overview our total assets were billion at december   an increase of million or from the end of at year end  stockholders equity was million and our stated book value was per share 
securities our securities portfolio is comprised primarily of mortgage backed securities with an emphasis on securities with adjustable rate features 
at december   securities totaled million  compared to million at december   a decrease of million or 
at year end  the securities portfolio included of securities that were adjustable rate and that were fixed rate 
throughout  we undertook a program to reduce interest rate risk in our available for sale portfolio  selling fixed rate securities and replacing them with adjustable rate securities 
as a result  the duration of our securities portfolio at year end was years compared to years at the end of  based on prevailing expectations for mortgage prepayments at both dates 
at year end  million of securities were classified as available for sale  none were in the held to maturity category and million were trading assets 
during  we transferred securities in the held to maturity category  all of which were fixed rate  into the available for sale category to permit sale at a later date 
at december   million of securities were classified as available for sale  million were in the held to maturity category and million were trading assets 
the market values assigned to the available for sale portfolio were derived using market quotations at period end 
unrealized market valuation gains and losses on those securities were recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of deferred income taxes 
securities in the held to maturity portfolio  if any  were 
table of contents carried at amortized cost 
trading assets were carried at current market values with any resulting adjustment reflected in current earnings 
included in the trading asset category at year end were several investments acquired in prior years  including million in overcollateralization and residual interests in cash flows from securitizations of high ltv loans in december and june  and million representing excess spread on mortgage servicing rights 
a subordinate tranche in the june securitization had been held in the trading category at the end of but was sold during under applicable accounting rules  use of quoted market values is the preferred method for valuing trading assets 
however  where the market for those assets is illiquid and price quotations are not readily available  other methods are permitted  including techniques utilizing the present value of expected cash flows 
we have used present value techniques to value our trading assets 
for additional information on the assumptions used to value our trading assets  see note  summary of significant accounting policies and note securities in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
loans management has placed an increased emphasis on commercial and consumer lending to improve the overall profitability of the loan portfolio and diversify risk 
mortgage lending for both residential and commercial real estate purposes continue to be important products for us under our conservative underwriting guidelines 
the mix of our loan portfolio changed during with commercial and consumer loans comprising of the total portfolio at the end of compared to at the end of residential and commercial real estate mortgages comprised of the portfolio at december   down from a year ago

the changes in net interest margin throughout reflect the overall rapid decline in market interest rates that took place during the year 
the repricing structure of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is asset sensitive  meaning that asset yield declines faster than funds costs during the first three to four months following a rate reduction 
the series of consecutive rate cuts during lengthened the time needed to stabilize the net interest margin 
also contributing to the decline in net interest margin during was a change in asset mix with a higher percentage of earning assets invested in mortgage securities and a reduced amount of loans outstanding

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity and asset liability management liquidity liquidity represents our ability to meet our continuing funding needs  primarily loan growth  deposit withdrawals  and scheduled repayment of borrowings 
primary sources of liquidity for the bank include the deposit gathering capacity of our retail banking network and borrowings from the fhlb 
the bank also has available to it secured borrowing lines utilizing our mortgage securities portfolio as collateral 
the primary source of funds for the company is dividends from the bank which the company relies on for its debt service obligations 
at january   the bank had a  surplus position for dividend payment purposes 
the parent company also had million of unrestricted cash available to it 
annual debt service requirements for the parent company are million 
statutory requirements of the state of florida determine the amount of legal liquidity required to be held by the bank 
at december   the bank s liquidity ratio  calculated by dividing net cash and investments of million by net deposits and short term liabilities of billion  was as compared to at december  net liquid assets were million in excess of the amount required by florida statutes 
asset liability management the primary objective of interest rate risk management is to minimize the effects that changes in interest rates have on net interest income 
this is accomplished through active management of asset and liability portfolios  including the timing of repricing of assets and liabilities and the optimum mix of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
management has formed an asset liability committee alco that meets periodically to monitor the loan  investment and liability portfolios and determine appropriate strategies to meet interest rate risk objectives 
we manage interest rate risk primarily by changing the maturity distribution of our investment portfolio and emphasizing loan originations carrying variable interest rates tied to interest sensitive indices 
additionally  the bank may employ long term fixed rate advances from the fhlb to improve the match between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the bank does not currently utilize off balance sheet hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors or other such financial derivatives but may do so in the future  subject to prior approval by the board of directors 
one traditional measure of the mismatch of assets maturing or re pricing within certain periods  and liabilities maturing or re pricing within the same period  is the gap for such period 
controlling the maturity or re pricing of an institution s assets and liabilities in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
positive gap occurs  during a specific time period  when more of an institution s assets are scheduled to re price than its liabilities  so that barring other factors affecting interest income and expense  in periods of falling interest rates the institution s interest income would decrease more rapidly than its interest expense  and in periods of rising interest rates the institution s interest income would increase more rapidly than its interest expense 
negative gap occurs when more of an institution s liabilities are scheduled to re price than its assets  so that  barring other factors affecting interest income and expense  in periods of rising interest rates the institution s interest expense would increase more rapidly than its interest income  and in periods of falling interest rates the institution s interest expense would decrease more rapidly than its interest income 
in addition to the traditional gap measurement  management also relies on the measurement of the duration of the balance sheet 
duration is determined by calculating the weighted average of the terms of future cash flows  where the present values of the cash flows are the weights 
this provides the effective term of a series of cash flows  comparable to the term of a zero coupon single cash flow instrument and is a measure of the price sensitivity of an instrument with the price of a longer term instrument being more sensitive than that of a shorter term instrument 
our policy is to maintain a cumulative one year gap of no more than plus or minus of total assets 
also  it is our policy to limit interest rate risk over the entire range of maturities on the balance sheet by 
table of contents minimizing the difference between asset and liability equity durations 
we monitor our compliance with this policy through measurement of the sensitivity of changes in net interest income to changes in interest rates 
our policy guideline is to limit the change in net interest income over a one year time horizon to no more than of base net interest income  assuming a basis point change in market interest rates ramped over the one year period 
the cumulative one year gap at december   was a positive million  or a positive expressed as a percentage of total assets 
at the end of the cumulative one year gap was a negative million or a negative of total assets 
also at year end  the duration of our assets was years while the duration of our liabilities and equity was years 
a duration of years was assigned to non interest bearing assets  non interest bearing liabilities and equity accounts 
at the end of  asset duration was years while liability equity duration was years 
the following table presents the maturities or re pricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the balances shown have been derived based on the financial characteristics of the various assets and liabilities 
adjustable and floating rate assets are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than their scheduled maturity dates 
fixed rate loans are shown in the periods in which they are scheduled to be repaid according to contractual amortization and  where appropriate  prepayment assumptions  based on the coupon rates in the portfolio have been used to adjust the repayment amounts 
re pricing of time deposits is based on their scheduled maturities 
certain decay rate assumptions have been used for those deposits without contractual maturities 
based on these assumptions  the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet at december  would be as follows in thousands months months years over years amount yield rate amount yield rate amount yield rate amount yield rate interest earning assets securities federal funds sold interest bearing deposits fhlb stock portfolio loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest checking money market savings time deposits fhlb advances outside borrowings holding company debt total interest bearing liabilities asset liability gap cumulative asset liability gap cumulative gap 
table of contents the following table shows the effect that the indicated change in interest rates would have on net interest income  projected for the next months under a static interest rate scenario 
each change in interest rates is ramped pro rata over a month time horizon 
the resulting change in net interest income from the static interest rate projection provides one measure of sensitivity in relation to changing interest rates  given the assumptions used in this process 
the percentage change projected for net interest income from a static rate projection  assuming a rate shock ramped over a month period  was as follows if interest rates change increase basis points increase basis points decrease basis points decrease basis points off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements include financial guarantees  contingent interests  derivative instruments and interests in unconsolidated entities where portions of those entities losses may be absorbed by the holder 
derivatives include such instruments as interest rate swaps  caps  floors  collars and forward sale contracts 
we did not hold any such off balance sheet arrangements at december  and our off balance contracts were limited to loan commitments and letters of credit made to our borrowers in the normal course of business
