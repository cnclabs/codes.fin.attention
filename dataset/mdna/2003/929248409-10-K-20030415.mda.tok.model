shipments historically have been concentrated within seven majo r market segments steel service centers  converters processors  construction agriculture  container  automotive  and appliances 
the overall participation i n the construction and the converters processors markets substantially exceeds th e industry average and its reliance on automotive shipments  as a percentage o f total shipments are substantially less than the industry average 
percent of total net tons shipped year ended december  steel service centers converters processors construction agriculture containers automotive appliances exports other total products shipped to wheeling nisshin and occ are included primaril y in the converters processors and containers markets  respectively 
set forth below is a description of the wpc group s major custome r categories steel service centers 
the shipments to steel service centers ar e heavily concentrated in the areas of hot rolled and hot dipped galvanized coils due to increased in house costs to steel companies during the s fo r processing services such as slitting  shearing and blanking  steel servic e centers have become a major factor in the distribution of hot rolled products t o ultimate end users 
in addition  steel service centers have become a significan t factor in the sale of hot dipped galvanized products to a variety of smal l consumers such as mechanical contractors  who desire not to be burdened wit h large steel inventories 
converters processors 
the growth of shipments to th e converters processors market is principally attributable to the increase i n shipments of cold rolled products to wheeling nisshin  which uses cold rolle d coils as a substrate to manufacture a variety of coated products  includin g hot dipped galvanized and aluminized coils for the automotive  appliance an d construction markets 
the converters processors industry also represents a majo r outlet for their hot rolled products  which are converted into finishe d commodities such as pipe  tubing and cold rolled strip 
construction 
the shipments to the construction industry are heavil y influenced by fabricated product sales 
wpc services the non residential an d agricultural building and highway industries  principally through shipments o f hot dipped galvanized and painted cold rolled products 
wpc has been able t o market its products into broad geographical areas due to its numerous regiona l facilities 
agriculture 
the shipments to the agricultural market ar e principally sales of roll formed  corrugated sheets which are used as roofin g and siding in the construction of barns  farm machinery enclosures and ligh t commercial buildings 
containers 
the vast majority of shipments to the container marke t are concentrated in tin mill products  which are utilized extensively in th e manufacture of food  aerosol  beverage and general line cans 
the containe r industry has represented a stable market 
the balance of shipments to thi s market consists of cold rolled products for pails and drums 
as a result of th e occ joint venture  the wpc group phased out its existing tin mill productio n facilities 
wpc and nittetsu distribute tin products produced by occ 
automotive 
unlike the majority of its competitors  the wpc group i s not heavily dependent on shipments to the automotive industry 
however  the wp c group has established higher value added niches in this market  particularly i n the area of hot dipped galvanized products for deep drawn automotive underbod y parts 
in addition  the wpc group has been a supplier of tin mill products fo r automotive applications  such as oil filters and gaskets 
appliances 
the shipments to the appliance market are concentrate d in hot dipped galvanized and hot rolled coils 
these products are furnishe d directly to appliance manufacturers as well as to blanking  drawing and stampin g companies that supply oems 
the wpc group has concentrated on niche produc t applications primarily used in washer dryer  refrigerator freezer and rang e appliances 
raw materials the wpc group has the right under the bankruptcy code  subject t o bankruptcy court approval and certain other conditions  to assume or reject an y pre petition executory contracts and unexpired leases 
parties affected by suc h rejections may file pre petition claims with the bankruptcy court in accordanc e with bankruptcy procedures 
in the following discussion  certain existin g contracts of the wpc group are described without attempting to predict whethe r such contracts ultimately will be assumed or rejected in the chapter cases 
the wpc group has a long term contract to purchase a minimum of of its iron ore needs through the iron ore price is based upon prevailin g world market prices 
the wpc group generally consumes approximately millio n gross tons of iron ore pellets in its blast furnace annually 
the wpc group wil l obtain the balance of its iron ore from spot and medium term purchase agreement s at prevailing world market prices 
the wpc group has a long term supply agreement with a third party t o provide the wpc group with a substantial portion of the wpc group s metallurgical coal requirements at competitive prices 
the wpc group s cokin g operations require a substantial amount of metallurgical coal 
the wpc group currently produces coke in excess of its requirement s and typically consumes generally all of the resultant by product coke oven gas in  the wpc group consumed approximately million tons of coking coal i n the production of blast furnace coke 
the wpc group sells its excess coke an d coke oven by products to third party trade customers 
the wpc group s operations require material amounts of other ra w materials  including limestone  oxygen  natural gas and electricity 
these ra w materials are readily available and are purchased on the open market 
the wp c group is presently dependent on external steel scrap for approximately o f its steel melt 
the cost of these materials has been susceptible in the past t o price fluctuations  but worldwide competition in the steel industry ha s frequently limited the ability of steel producers to raise finished produc t prices to recover higher material costs 
certain of the wpc group s raw materia l supply contracts provide for price adjustments in the event of increase d commodity or energy prices 
backlog the wpc group s steel division order backlog was  net tons a t december   compared to  net tons at december  all order s related to the backlog at december  are expected to be shipped durin g the first half of  subject to delays at the customers request 
the orde r backlog represents orders received but not yet completed or shipped 
in times o f strong demand  a higher order backlog may allow the company to increas e production runs  thereby enhancing production efficiencies 
capital investments the wpc group anticipates that it will fund its capital expenditure s in from cash on hand  funds generated by operations and funds availabl e under the dip credit agreement  to the extent available 
it is anticipated tha t capital expenditures will be minimized during the chapter proceedings unti l liquidity is sufficient and stabilized 
there can be no assurance that suc h funds will be sufficient to fund required capital expenditures 
the wpc group s capital expenditures including capitalized interest for wer e approximately million  including million on environmental projects from to such expenditures aggregated approximately million 
the whx group has no obligation to fund any of the wpc group s future capital expenditures  and does not anticipate doing so 
in the event tha t the wpc group is unable to fund its environmental capital expenditures  claim s may be made against whx for payment of such costs 
energy requirements many of the major facilities at the wpc group that use natural ga s have been equipped to use alternative fuels 
during  coal constitute d approximately of the wpc group s total energy consumption  natural gas and electricity 
the company continually monitors its operations regardin g potential equipment conversion and fuel substitution to reduce energy costs 
employment at december   the wpc group had  employees of whic h  were represented by the united steel workers of america uswa  b y other unions  were salaried employees and the remainder of were non unio n operating employees 
on october   the bankruptcy court entered an order which among other things  approved the terms of the modified labor agreement mla by and among wpc  wpsc and the uswa 
the company is not a party to the mla 
th e mla modifies the current wpsc collective bargaining agreement to provide for among other things  immediate reductions in wages and the cost of providin g medical benefits to active and retired employees in exchange for improvement i n wages and pension benefits for hourly employees upon a confirmed wpsc chapter plan of reorganization 
the mla is part of a comprehensive support arrangemen t that also involves concessions from wpsc salaried employees  wpsc s vendors an d other constituencies in the chapter proceedings 
in light of the chapter cases  the uswa has agreed to temporaril y waive certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreement regardin g guaranteed employment and to temporarily postpone certain gainsharing payment s that otherwise would be due 
competition the steel industry is cyclical in nature and has been marke d historically by overcapacity  resulting in intense competition 
wpc face s increasing competitive pressures from other domestic integrated producers mini mills and processors 
processors compete with wpc in the areas of slitting cold rolling and coating 
mini mills are generally smaller volume stee l producers that use ferrous scrap metals as their basic raw material 
compared t o integrated producers  mini mills  which rely on less capital intensive stee l production methods  have certain advantages 
since mini mills typically are no t unionized  they have more flexible work rules that have resulted in lowe r employment costs per net ton shipped 
since  significant flat rolle d mini mill capacity has been constructed and these mini mills now compete wit h integrated producers in product areas that traditionally have not face d significant competition from mini mills 
in addition  there has been significan t additional flat rolled mini mill capacity constructed in recent years 
thes e mini mills and processors compete with wpc primarily in the commodit y flat rolled steel market 
in the long term  such mini mills and processors ma y also compete with wpc in producing value added products 
in addition  th e increased competition in commodity product markets influence certain integrate d producers to increase product offerings to compete with wpc s custom products 
as the single largest steel consuming country in the western world the united states has long been a favorite market of steel producers in europ e and japan 
in addition  steel producers from korea  taiwan  and brazil  an d other large economies such as russia and china  have also recognized the unite d states as a target market 
steel imports of flat rolled products as a percentag e of domestic apparent consumption  excluding semi finished steel  have bee n approximately in  in  in  in and i n imports surged in due to severe economic conditions in southeas t asia  latin america  japan and russia  among others 
average import custom s values in december continued to be depressed with the average import valu e of some key finished steel products below values reported in the depths of th e crisis 
world steel demand  world export prices  us dollar exchange rate s and the international competitiveness of the domestic steel industry have al l been factors in these import levels 
in march  the united states government announced its decisio n to enact tariffs on certain imported steel 
these tariffs begin at and rang e down to over three years 
certain of these tariffs will be imposed on stee l imports that compete directly with wpc 
this has had a favorable impact on wp c and on the united states steel industry 
total annual steel consumption in the united states has fluctuate d between million and million tons since a number of stee l substitutes  including plastics  aluminum  composites and glass  have reduce d the growth of domestic steel consumption 
item properties whx group h h has active operating plants in the united states  canada denmark and singapore owned with a total area of approximately  square feet  including warehouse  office and laboratory space  but not includin g the plant used by the singapore operation 
h h also owns or leases sales service and warehouse facilities at two other locations in the united state s which  with h h s general offices  have a total area of approximately  square feet and owns ten non operating or discontinued locations with a tota l area of approximately  square feet 
h h considers its manufacturin g plants and services facilities to be well maintained and efficiently equipped and therefore suitable for the work being done

item legal proceedings the whx group sec enforcement action on june   the securities and exchange commission sec instituted an administrative proceeding against the company alleging that it ha d violated certain sec rules in connection with the tender offer for dynamic s corporation of america dca commenced on march  through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  sb acquisition corp 
offer 
specifically  the orde r instituting proceedings order alleges that  in its initial form  the offe r violated the all holders rule  rule d a under the securities exchang e act of  as amended exchange act  based on the company s inclusion of a record holder condition in the offer 
no shareholder had tendered any share s at the time the condition was removed 
the order further alleges that th e company violated rules d c and d d under the exchange act upo n expiration of the offer  by allegedly waiving material conditions to the offe r without prior notice to shareholders and purchasing the approximately o f dca s outstanding shares tendered pursuant to the offer 
the sec does not clai m that the offer was intended to or in fact defrauded any investor 
the order institutes proceedings to determine whether the sec shoul d enter an order requiring the company a to cease and desist from committing o r causing any future violation of the rules alleged to have been violated and b to pay approximately million in disgorgement of profits 
the company file d an answer denying any violations and seeking dismissal of the proceeding 
o n october   the initial decision of the administrative law judge who hear d the case dismissed all charges against the company  with the finding that th e company had not violated the law 
the division of enforcement has filed a petition for the sec to review the decision and a brief  but only as to the al l holders rule claim 
the commission  however  has authority to review any issue s on its own accord 
whx has filed its opposition brief 
pbgc action on march   the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc issued its notice of determination notice and on march   the pbg c published its notice and filed a summons and complaint complaint in unite d states district court for the southern district of new york seeking th e involuntary termination of the whx pension plan whx pension plan 
the pbg c stated in its notice that it took this action because of its concern tha t pbgc s possible long run loss with respect to the whx pension plan ma y reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the whx pension plan is no t terminated 
whx filed an answer to this complaint on march   contestin g the pbgc s action 
the pbgc has announced that it contends that the whx pensio n plan has roughly million in assets to cover more than million i n benefit liabilities  resulting in a funding shortfall of roughly millio n without accounting for plant shutdown benefits 
furthermore  the pbgc contend s in a press release that plant shutdown liabilities of the whx pension plan  i f they were to occur  would exceed million

as a result o f the company s probable obligation to fund million to wpc  the company ha s recorded a million charge as equity in loss of wpc in the accompanyin g consolidated statement of operations 
on march   the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc published its notice of determination notice and filed a summons an d complaint complaint in united states district court for the souther n district of new york seeking to terminate the whx corporation pension plan wh x plan 
the pbgc stated in its notice that it took this action because of it s concern that pbgc s possible long run loss with respect to the whx plan ma y reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the whx plan is no t terminated 
whx filed an answer to this complaint on march   contestin g the pbgc s action 
the pbgc s action to terminate the whx pension plan was take n following the initial rejection on february  by the eslgb of rbc s application for a million federal loan guaranty 
the pbgc has been notifie d of the loan guaranty approval on march  as described above  obtainin g an acceptable resolution of the treatment of the whx pension plan is a conditio n to the loan guaranty 
if an acceptable resolution is not obtained on or befor e june   then a condition to the loan guaranty shall not have bee n satisfied 
if the loan guaranty is not granted it is unlikely that the presen t plan of reorganization  filed with the bankruptcy court on december  will be confirmed 
furthermore  it is doubtful that an alternative plan could b e confirmed in a reasonable time frame although wpc management has indicated tha t it would attempt to pursue such an alternate plan 
in either case there can b e no assurance as to the future of the wpc group 
the pbgc contends that the wh x pension plan has roughly million in assets to cover more than millio n in benefit liabilities resulting in a funding shortfall of approximately million without accounting for shutdown benefits 
furthermore  the pbg c contends that shutdown liabilities  if they were to occur  could be as much a s million 
whx disputes the pbgc s calculation of liabilities and shutdow n claims since the actual amount of these liabilities may be substantially less based on alternative actuarial assumptions 
however  there can be no assuranc e that whx s assumptions will be accepted 
if the pbgc s action is successful an d the whx pension plan is terminated  whx expects that it will be subject to a claim by the pbgc of at least million 
whx intends to vigorously defen d itself against such claims  but there can be no assurance that whx woul d prevail 
if the whx pension plan were terminated  whx believes it is unlikel y that the present plan of reorganization  filed with the bankruptcy court file d on december   will be confirmed 
furthermore  it is doubtful that a n alternative plan could be confirmed in a reasonable time frame although wp c management has indicated that it would attempt to pursue such an alternat e plan 
in either case there can be no assurance as to the future of the wp c group 
if a cessation of operations of the wpc group or termination of the pla n were to occur  the consequential cash funding obligations to the whx pensio n plan would have a material adverse impact on the liquidity  financial positio n and capital resources of whx 
management of the company cannot at this time determine wit h certainty the ultimate outcome of the chapter proceedings or the related pbg c action  however it is possible that the following outcomes could result  whethe r upon the confirmation of the plan of reorganization as submitted or as it may b e amended or modified  or otherwise a the wpc group could reorganize  and its creditors could receive a portion of their claims in cash or in stock of wpc or wpsc 
i n such a case  the whx group would have little or no futur e ownership in or involvement with the wpc group except as a creditor and the whx group s future cash obligations to or o n behalf of the wpc group would be minimal to none other than th e whx contributions  referred to above 
b the pbgc could prevail in its actions to terminate the wh x pension plan  which could result in a partial or complet e liquidation of the wpc group 
if such liquidation were to occur whx could be responsible for significant early retirement pensio n benefits 
in such a case  the pbgc would likely seek to enforc e claims for shutdown liabilities against whx in addition to th e million claims for accumulated benefit liabilities referre d to above 
the pbgc asserts that shutdown claims arising from a complete liquidation of the wpc group would result in claim s against whx as much as million 
a shutdown of only a portio n of the wpc group s facilities would generate shutdown liabilitie s in a lower amount 
whx disputes the pbgc s assertion with regar d to each of their claims 
if the pbgc were to prevail against th e company  the pbgc could file a claim against whx and the othe r members of the whx controlled group in an amount from million to million  which whx would be unable to fund 
in connection with past collective bargaining agreements by an d between the wpc group and the united steelworkers of america  afl cio cl c uswa  the wpc group is obligated to provide certain medical insurance  lif e insurance  disability and surviving spouse retirement benefits to retire d employees and their dependents opeb obligations 
whx is not a signatory t o any of these agreements 
however  whx has separately agreed to be contingentl y liable for a portion of the opeb obligations 
whx s contingent obligation woul d be triggered in the event that the wpc group was to fail to satisfy its ope b obligations 
whx s contingent obligation is limited to of the accumulate d post retirement benefit obligation with respect to the wpc group s employees an d retirees represented by the uswa 
wpsc s total opeb obligation at january is estimated to be million 
whx has estimated that approximately of employees and retirees entitled to such opeb obligations are represented b y the uswa 
whx s liability for opeb obligations exists only so long as a majority of the directors of wpsc or wpc are affiliated with whx  wh x controls the board of directors of wpsc or wpc through appointment or electio n of a majority of such directors  or whx  through other means  exercises a level of control normally associated with or above 
if the por i s confirmed  the company believes that its liability for the opeb obligation s would be eliminated

h h has elected not to borrow any additional funds against the h h facilities until such time as the pbgc action is resolved 
if the pbgc action is upheld and the whx pensio n plan is terminated  such termination would constitute an event of default unde r the h h facilities 
if h h is unable to cure the default or obtain an amendment to the h h facilities  it could lead to a cancellation of the h h facilities and an acceleration of the outstanding borrowings 
if the lenders were to accelerate the obligations under the h h facilities it would have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity  financia l position and capital resources of h h
