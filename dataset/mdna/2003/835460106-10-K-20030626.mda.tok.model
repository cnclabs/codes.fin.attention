item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview  certain factors that make future results difficult to predict  certain items to remember when reading our financial statements our quarterly and annual operating results vary significantly depending on the timing of new product introductions and enhancements by ourselves and by our competitors 
our results also depend on the volume and timing of our professional customer orders and on shipments of our oem partners which are difficult to forecast 
because our professional customers generally order on an as needed basis and we normally ship products within one week after receipt of an order  and because our oem partners report shipments during or after the end of the period  we do not have an order backlog which can assist us in forecasting results 
for all these reasons  our results of operations for any quarter or any year are a poor indicator of the results to be expected in any future quarter or year 
a large portion of our quarterly and annual professional product revenue is usually generated in the last few weeks of the quarter 
since our ongoing operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we plan our expenditures based primarily on sales forecasts  if professional revenue generated in the last few weeks of a quarter or year or if oem partner shipments do not meet our forecast  operating results can be very negatively affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
our management is also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow very specific and detailed guidance in measuring revenue 
certain judgments  however  affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
we have adopted statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  and sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain arrangements and in certain instances in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
sop requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products  hardware  upgrades  enhancements  maintenance and support  installation and training to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on vendor specific objective evidence 
we derive our software revenue primarily from licenses of our software products including any related hardware components  development agreements and maintenance and support 
revenue recognized from 
table of contents multiple element software arrangements is allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of elements  for example  the license to use the software products versus maintenance and support for the software product 
the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence specific to us 
objective evidence of fair values of all elements of an arrangement is based upon our standard pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately 
objective evidence of support services is measured by annual renewal rates 
sop requires recognition of revenue using the residual method in a multiple element arrangement when fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement 
under the residual method  the total fair value of the undelivered elements are deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with sop the difference between the total software arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product including hardware has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
in addition  royalty revenue from certain distributors that do not meet our credit standards and revenues from our distributor agreement with daikin are recognized upon sell through to the end customer 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than one year not to be fixed and determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
revenue from development agreements  whereby the development is essential to the functionality of the licensed software  is recognized over the service period based on proportional performance 
under this method  management is required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project  and revenues and profits are recognized as the contract progresses to completion 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenues have not been recognized which results from the following deferred maintenance and support  amounts billed to certain distributors for our products not yet sold through to the end user customers  amounts billed in excess of services performed to technology customers for license and development agreements  and amounts billed to certain oems for products which contain one or more undelivered elements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in our portfolio of receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if payments from customers are significantly delayed  additional allowances might be required 
capitalized software we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
such capitalized costs are amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated economic life of the product  which is generally three years 
periodically  we compare a product s unamortized capitalized cost to the product s net realizable value 
to the extent unamortized capitalized cost exceeds net realizable value based on the product s estimated future gross revenues  reduced by the estimated cost of sales  the excess is written off 
this analysis requires us to estimate future gross revenues associated with certain products  and the future cost of sales 
if these estimates change  write offs of capitalized software costs could result 
business acquisitions  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expense 
the determination of value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires management to make various estimates and assumptions 
estimates using different  but each reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results 

table of contents on april  we adopted sfas no 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized over its estimated useful life  rather  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we continually review the events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment for factors that would provide evidence of impairment of goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined in sfas goodwill is tested for impairment annually in a two step process 
first  we determine if the carrying amount exceeds fair value based on quoted market prices of our common stock  which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  we will compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas  to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
goodwill has resulted from our ravisent product business acquisition during the first quarter ended june   which was accounted for as a purchase  and from our dmd acquisition from veritas during the third quarter ended december   which was also accounted for as a purchase 
as of march   no events have occurred that would lead us to believe that there has been any impairment 
stock based compensation we follow accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
see note and to our financial statements for march   and included elsewhere in this annual report for further discussion of our stock based compensation plans  including the illustration of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas impairment of long lived assets on april   we adopted sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supersedes certain provisions of apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions and supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
there was not a cumulative transition adjustment upon adoption 
in accordance with sfas  we evaluate long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
we do not have any long lived assets which we consider to be impaired as of march  other disclosures investment in sonicstudio llc in march  we executed an agreement to form a new company  sonicstudio llc in partnership with a limited liability corporation controlled by two individuals 
the book value of net assets and liabilities transferred to sonicstudio llc  totaled  we account for this investment in sonicstudio llc using the modified equity method 
as of march   our investment in sonicstudio llc totaled  under the terms of the agreement  sonicstudio llc compensated us for the sonic studio business with a three year promissory note for  the promissory note  which does not carry interest  will be repaid to us with a percentage royalty based on sales received by sonicstudio llc  plus any share of profits paid by them to us 
when the note is retired  we expect to have a interest in sonicstudio llc 

table of contents other contingencies we are subject to various claims relating to products  technology  patent  shareholder and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
the amount of loss accrual  if any  is determined after careful analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted

results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from sonic solutions statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal years through years ended march  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses marketing and sales research and development general and administrative business integration total operating expenses operating income loss other expense provision benefit for income taxes net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended march   and net revenue 
our net revenue increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  representing an increase of and increased to  in fiscal  representing an increase of 
the increase in net revenue in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in sales of our consumer products which increased approximately from fiscal the increase in sales was due to new oem licensing agreements entered into during the fiscal year and the increase in volume of sales reported by the existing oem partners 
included in consumer sales is revenue recognized on license development contracts entered into during fiscal this increase was offset in part by a decrease in our professional audio and video sales of approximately 
the increase in net revenue in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in sales  both from new and existing oem partners  of our consumer products which increased approximately 
included in consumer product sales is revenue recognized on new license development contracts which were entered into during the second half of fiscal and this increase was offset in part by a decrease in our professional audio and video sales of approximately 
international sales accounted for  of our net revenue in fiscal year  of our net revenue in fiscal year and of our net revenue in fiscal year see note of notes to financial statements 
international sales have historically ranged from to slightly less than of our total sales  and we expect that they will continue to represent a significant percentage of future revenue 
the percentage has decreased in fiscal year due to the increase in domestic oem revenue from our consumer products 

table of contents cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased from of net revenue in fiscal to in fiscal to in fiscal the decreases in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue were primarily due to a shift in sales product mix towards higher margin consumer products including software license and development contracts and to the reduction of hardware as a percentage of revenue in our professional audio and video systems 
marketing and sales 
our marketing and sales expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and increased to  in fiscal marketing and sales represented  and of net revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
our marketing and sales expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to lower advertising and collateral expenses  which decreased approximately  and lower salary expense which decreased approximately  as a result of our reduction in headcount 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in commission expense due to the increase in sales 
our marketing and sales expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in salary expenses of approximately  relating to the increase in headcount 
this increase was partially offset with changes in other expenses  primarily the decrease in dealer and employee commission expenses  due to increased oem and direct sales  of approximately  our marketing and sales headcount decreased from forty nine at march  to forty four at march  and increased to fifty at march  dealer and employee commission expenses  as a percentage of net revenue increased from in fiscal to in fiscal and decreased to in fiscal research and development 
our research and development expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal to  in fiscal our research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue were in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal our research and development expenses increased primarily due to higher salary expense associated with increases in headcount  which increased by approximately  and  for fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year was also due to an increase in consulting expense of approximately  and an increase in the allocation of occupancy expenses relating to the increase in headcount and the additional office locations 
our headcount increased from thirty two at march  to forty nine at march  to one hundred and forty one at march  the increase in headcount during fiscal year is primarily the result of two acquisitions made during the fiscal year 
we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
this means that a portion of the costs we incur for software development are not recorded as an expense in the period in which they are actually incurred 
instead  they are recorded as an asset on our balance sheet 
the amount recorded on our balance sheet is then amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products in which the software is included 
during fiscal year we capitalized approximately  and amortized approximately  excluding amounts relating to the daikin acquisition 
during fiscal year  we capitalized approximately  and amortized approximately  excluding amounts relating to daikin  ravisent and dmd acquisitions 
the ravisent and dmd acquisitions are discussed under the heading acquisitions 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and increased to  in fiscal these expenses represented of net revenue in fiscal  of net revenue in fiscal and of net revenue in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to reduced legal fees and a reversal of previously recorded bad debt reserve which was no longer required due to our improvement in collections as a result of the continued shift in our customer base towards larger and more established oem customers 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to increased rent  insurance  professional and other general expenses related to the overall increase in our headcount from one hundred and ten at march  to two hundred and eleven at march  we anticipate that general and administrative expenses may increase as our operations expand 

table of contents business integration expense 
in conjunction with the daikin acquisition completed in february fiscal year  we incurred expenses to transition the business to our management 
as such  these expenses did not exist during fiscal year business integration expenses primarily consisted of engineering consulting expenses per the consulting agreement we entered into with daikin dated february  other income and expense 
other income on our statement of operations includes the interest we earned on cash balances and short term investments 
interest income was approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
other expense in fiscal year consists primarily of interest and other financing charges associated with the debt arrangements with hambrecht quist 
other expense in fiscal years and primarily consist of write downs of investments in other entities which totaled approximately  and  respectively  which was offset in part by the interest income discussed above 
provision for income taxes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we made no provision for us income taxes for our  and years 
for the and fiscal years foreign tax expense was recorded to reflect the taxes withheld by various japanese customers and paid to the japanese taxing authorities 
acquisitions 
on february   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with daikin industries  ltd  a japanese corporation  whereby on that date we acquired daikin dvd 
in return for the assets acquired  we issued  shares of common stock valued at approximately  and  shares of preferred stock valued at approximately  the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the operating results have been included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition  we acquired all the daikin dvd related products and intellectual property rights which is included in purchased and internally developed software costs 
additionally  we acquired tangible assets such as furniture  computers and other electronic assets  some of which will continue to be used specifically in the acquired dvd software development business while others will be used in our general dvd authoring tool business 
on may   we entered into an agreement with axeda  under which axeda licensed ravisent s software dvd player and other digital media technologies to us 
under the agreement  we paid axeda a one time fee of  for the license and related agreements  and in return we obtained exclusive rights to deploy the ravisent technologies in the personal computer market 
as part of this agreement we acquired a revenue generating business  fixed assets  developed software and engineering employees 
the accounting for this transaction was applied pursuant to the purchase accounting method 
on november   we entered into an agreement with veritas to acquire the business of the veritas desktop mobile division dmd  which sold personal computer based cd rom  cd audio and dvd rom mastering software and personal computer backup software 
the transactions contemplated by the agreement were closed on december  we acquired the dmd business to expand our suite of cd and dvd mastering products 
under this agreement with veritas we acquired all the software and other intellectual property required to carry on development and marketing of products sold by the dmd business  and we assumed essentially all of dmd businesses outstanding customers and other contracts 
under this agreement  almost all of the employees of the dmd business approximately individuals joined sonic 
under the asset purchase agreement  we issued  shares of series f preferred stock convertible into  shares of our common stock 
the total purchase price was approximately  and the accounting for this transactions was applied pursuant to the purchase accounting method

during the fiscal years discussed above  our current ratio has fluctuated  primarily due to the increase in our deferred revenue and deposits 
during fiscal year  our current ratio increased over fiscal year  primarily due to increase in cash from deposits and prepayments received from oem and licensing customers which were offset in part by the increase in the deferred revenue account 
during fiscal year  our current ratio increased primarily due to the decrease in deferred revenue and deposits 
in addition to our operations  we utilized cash during the  and fiscal years to purchase new fixed assets  and to fund the development of capitalized software 
during the fiscal year  cash of  was used to complete the acquisition of the ravisent product line from axeda and  was used to complete the acquisition of the dmd business from veritas 
we lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases 
rent expense under operating leases was approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
future payments under operating leases that have initial remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows in thousands 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases total we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal year as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of

risk factors 
you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as those in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission the risks identified below could cause the value of our shares to decline 
we cannot  however  estimate the likelihood that our shares may decline in value or the amount by which they may decline 
we have had losses in each of the past four fiscal years ending march  we were unprofitable during each of the four fiscal years ending march  for example  in fiscal year  we had a net loss of  and in fiscal year we had a net loss of  we were unprofitable during each quarter of the and fiscal years and during the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
although we were profitable in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and each of the four quarters of the fiscal year  we may not maintain profitability and as a result our share price may decline 
although we have provided revenue and profitable earnings guidance for fiscal  there are no assurances that we will meet such guidance and our inability to meet such guidance could cause our share price to decline 
during the fiscal year ended march  we had negative operating cash flows 
during the fiscal year ended march   we had a negative operating cash flow of  during the fiscal year ended march   we had a positive operating cash flow of  during the fiscal year ended march   we had a positive operating cash flow of  we may continue to report a negative operating cash flow in the future  and we may need to obtain additional financing to continue to operate 
if we are unable to obtain such financing  then we may have to cease or significantly curtail operations 
if sources of financing are not available  we may not have sufficient cash to satisfy working capital requirements 
we believe that our current cash balances are sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we may need to obtain additional financing at that time or prior to that time if our plans change or if we expend cash sooner than anticipated 
we currently do not have any commitments from third parties to provide additional capital 
the risk to us is that at the time we will need cash  financing from other sources may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
our failure to obtain financing could result in our insolvency and the loss to investors of their entire investment in our common stock 
any failure to successfully integrate the dmd business we purchased from veritas could negatively impact us 
the acquisition of the dmd business involves risks related to the integration and management of the dmd business  which will be a complex  time consuming and an expensive process and may disrupt our businesses if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
we may encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays in integrating the dmd operations  including potential conflicts between business cultures  adverse changes in business focus perceived by third party constituencies  potential conflicts in distribution  marketing or other important relationships  an inability to implement uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  an inability to integrate our research and development and product development efforts  the loss of current or future key employees and or the diversion of management s attention from other ongoing business concerns  
table of contents undiscovered and unknown problems  defects or other issues related to the dmd products that become known to us only some time after the acquisition  and negative reactions from our resellers and customers 
the dmd business may not be a positive contributor to our operations but instead may constitute a drain on our resources 
we may therefore not achieve the desired synergies and benefits of the dmd acquisition 
other recent acquisitions may compromise our operations and financial results 
the ravisent business line was not profitable when owned by axeda 
it is possible that the ravisent technology and employees will not be a positive contributor to our operations and instead will constitute a drain on our resources 
future acquisitions may compromise our operations and financial results 
as part of our efforts to enhance our existing products and introduce new products  we may pursue acquisitions of complementary companies  products and technologies 
acquisitions could adversely affect our operating results in the short term as a result of dilutive issuances of equity securities or usage of our cash and the incurrence of additional debt costs 
the purchase price for an acquired company may exceed its book value  creating goodwill  possibly resulting in significant impairment write downs charged to our operating results in future periods 
we have limited experience in acquiring and integrating outside businesses and future acquisitions are likely to involve similar risks associated with our financial results and the integration of technology and employees 
the issuance of stock under our registration statement will dilute the relative ownership of existing common shareholders and could result in lower market price for our stock 
as part of the acquisition of the dmd business  we issued veritas  shares of our series f convertible preferred stock 
in march   veritas converted all of their shares of series f preferred stock into  shares of our common stock which  based upon our common stock outstanding as of march   resulted in approximately a dilution to our shareholders 
our stock price has been volatile  is likely to continue to be volatile  and could decline substantially 
the price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
the price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for some of the following reasons future announcements concerning us or our competitors  quarterly variations in operating results  charges  amortization and other financial effects relating to our recent or future acquisitions  introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  acquisition or loss of significant customers  distributors or suppliers  business acquisitions or divestitures  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  issuances of stock under our shelf registration statement  fluctuations in the economy or general market conditions  our failure to successfully integrate the dmd business  or the delay in delivery to market or acceptance of new dvd products for example dvd recorders 

table of contents in addition  stock markets in general  and the market for shares of technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years which have frequently been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could decline below its current price and the market price of our stock may fluctuate significantly in the future 
these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance 
in the past  shareholders of various companies have often instituted securities class action litigation after periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
if a shareholder files a securities class action suit against us  we would incur substantial legal fees and our management s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 
if new digital formats are unsuccessful  it is unlikely that we will generate sufficient revenues to recover our development cost 
our business involves new digital audio and video formats  such as dvd video and dvd audio  and  more recently  the new recordable dvd formats including dvd ram  dvd r rw and dvd rw 
if these formats prove to be unsuccessful or are not accepted for any reason  there will be only limited demand for our products 
our reliance on outsourcing and single suppliers for our manufacturing and components makes us vulnerable to supplier operational problems 
our outsourcing manufacturing program commits responsibility for almost all of our manufacturing activities to a single supplier arrow bell electronics 
in addition  we often use components that are only available from a single source 
those components include  for example  phillip s video scaler and various xilinx devices 
reliance on a single supplier for manufacturing or for certain manufacturing components makes us vulnerable to operating  financial and other problems encountered by those suppliers 
if we fail to protect our products intellectual property rights  such as trade secrets  we may not be able to market our products successfully 
our products are based in large part on proprietary technology which we have sought to protect with patents  trademarks and trade secrets 
for example  we have numerous patents and we have also filed applications for additional patents 
we also registered trademarks for the following dvdit  mydvd  dvd creator  dvd fusion  recordnow  backup mypc  cineplayer  authorscript  reeldvd and primo skd among others 
to the extent that we use patents to protect our proprietary rights  we may not be able to obtain needed patents or  if granted  the patents may be held invalid or otherwise indefensible 
in addition  we make extensive use of trade secrets that we may not be able to protect 
to the extent we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  competitors may enter the market offering products identical to ours  with a negative impact on sales of our products 
other companies intellectual property rights may interfere with our current or future product development and sales 
we have never conducted a comprehensive patent search relating to the technology we use in our products 
there may be issued or pending patents owned by third parties that relate to our products 
if so  we could incur substantial costs defending against patent infringement claims or we could even be blocked from selling our products 
other companies may succeed in obtaining valid patents covering one or more of the key techniques we utilize in our products 
if so  we may be forced to obtain required licenses or implement alternative non infringing approaches 

table of contents our products are designed to adhere to industry standards  such as dvd rom  dvd video  dvd audio and mpeg video 
a number of companies and organizations hold various patents that claim to cover various aspects of dvd and mpeg technology 
we have entered into license agreements with certain companies relative to some of these technologies 
for instance  we have entered into license agreements with dolby licensing corporation covering dolby digital audio and with meridian audio limited covering meridian lossless packing 
such license agreements may not be sufficient to grant all of the intellectual property rights to us necessary to market our products 
we may become involved in costly and time consuming patent litigation 
third parties could pursue us claiming that our products infringe various patents 
patent infringement litigation can be time consuming and costly 
if the litigation resulted in an unfavorable outcome for us  we could be subject to substantial damage claims and a requirement that we obtain a royalty or license agreement to continue using the technology in issue 
such royalty or license agreements might not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all  resulting in serious harm to our business 
for example  a group of companies have formed an organization called mpeg la to enforce the rights of holders of patents covering aspects of mpeg video technology 
although we have entered into an agreement with mpeg la  that agreement may not prevent third parties from asserting that we infringe a patent covering the mpeg technology 
because a significant percentage of our professional dvd products operate only on macintosh computers  the potential success of these products is tied to the success of this platform 
several of our current professional dvd products  including dvd creator and dvd fusion  operate on macintosh computers manufactured by apple computer 
if the supply of macintosh computers becomes limited  sales of these products will likely decline 
if there is a decrease in the use of the macintosh computing platform in the professional and corporate audio and video markets  there will likely be a decrease in demand for our products 
if there are changes in the operating system or architecture of the macintosh  it is likely that we will incur significant costs to adapt our products to the changes 
our macintosh users generally demand that we maintain compatibility with the latest models of the macintosh and the macintosh os 
currently our dvd creator and dvd fusion applications run only on os macintosh os x currently offers a compatibility mode which supports os x compatible applications  but we believe that we will soon have to modify our dvd creator and dvd fusion applications for them to continue to be able to run with the latest macintosh models 
such a modification may be difficult to accomplish or infeasible and if it proves to be lengthy  our revenues could be significantly reduced in the interim 
because a large portion of our net revenue is from oem customers  the potential success of our products is tied to the success of their product sales 
much of our consumer revenue is derived from sales to large oem customers  which include dell  hewlett packard  sony  matrox and avid 
the revenue from many of these customers is recognized on a sell thru basis 
if these customers do not ship as many units as forecasted or if there is a decrease in their unit sales  our net revenue will be adversely impacted and we may be less profitable than forecasted or unprofitable 
some of our competitors possess greater technological and financial resources than we do  may produce better or more cost effective products than ours and may be more effective than we are in marketing and promoting their products 
there is a substantial risk that competing companies will produce better or more cost effective products  or will be better equipped than we are to promote them in the marketplace 
a number of companies have announced or are delivering products which compete with our products 
these include ahead  apple computer  cyberlink  dazzle a division of scm microsystems  intervideo  inc  mediostream  pinnacle  roxio and 
table of contents ulead 
see discussion entitled competition for desktop products in the business section of part i of this document 
most of these companies have greater financial and technological resources than ours 
our reliance on outsourcing our webstore makes us vulnerable to third party s operational problems 
we have initiated a web based retail store for our dvdit and mydvd products as well as some of our professional products  for example  reeldvd 
we currently outsource our webstore through an arrangement we have with digital river 
under this arrangement  digital river provides the servers which list our products and handle all purchase transactions through their secure web site 
outsourcing means that we are dependent on a third party for smooth operation of our webstore 
since our webstore sales are a significant portion of our revenues  interruption of our web store could have a negative effect on our business 
we have little ability to reduce expenses to compensate for reduced sales 
we tend to close a number of sales in the last month or last weeks of a quarter  especially in our professional audio and video business  and we generally do not know until quite late in a quarter whether our sales expectations for the quarter will be met 
for example  in recent quarters  as much as of our professional sales have been procured in the last month of the quarter
