item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of the year in  williams faced many challenges including credit and liquidity constraints following the deterioration of our energy industry sector in the wake of the enron collapse and the assumption of payment obligations and performance on guarantees associated with its former telecommunications subsidiary  williams communications group  inc wcg 
with the deterioration of the energy industry  the credit rating agencies requirements for investment grade companies became more stringent 
williams credit rating was lowered below an investment grade rating in the middle of during and more recently  williams has sold a significant amount of assets and or businesses and outlined plans to sell more assets to satisfy maturing debt obligations and strengthen its short term liquidity position 
in regards to the short term  williams  at december   has maturing notes payable and long term debt totaling approximately billion which includes certain contractual fees and deferred interest associated with an underlying debt through the first quarter of the following discussion outlines in more detail the events of through the filing of this form k and the challenges facing the company 
during december and first quarter  williams announced plans to strengthen its balance sheet and support retention of its investment grade ratings 
the plans included reducing capital expenditures during the balance of  future sales of assets to generate proceeds to be used to reduce outstanding debt and the lowering of expenses  in part through an enhanced benefit early retirement program which concluded during the second quarter 
towards these plans and in satisfaction of continued liquidity demands  williams completed debt issuances and sold one of its regulated interstate pipelines 
in addition  the company completed a consent agreement on behalf of the wcg obligations that precluded immediate performance by williams in the event of a bankruptcy filing by wcg 
in addition  the plan included the elimination of certain ratings triggers that would give rise to options to put or accelerate debt or cause redemption of preferred interests 
exposure to these ratings triggers was removed by the third quarter of williams also had exposure to ratings triggers through certain contracts of energy marketing trading which are discussed under credit ratings within financial condition and liquidity 
during the second quarter of  williams experienced liquidity constraints  the effect of which limited energy marketing trading s ability to manage market risk and exercise hedging strategies as market liquidity deteriorated 
during may  major rating agencies lowered their credit ratings on williams unsecured long term debt  however  the ratings remained investment grade for the balance of the second quarter 
williams announced it was expanding the scope of its plan to preserve its investment grade ratings  which included its intentions to offer for sale its two refineries and related assets  further reduce capital expenditures  scale back the operations of its energy marketing trading business and reduce its work force accordingly 
williams experienced a substantial net loss for the second quarter of the loss primarily resulted from a decline in energy marketing trading s results and reflected a significant decline in the forward mark to market value of its portfolio  the costs associated with terminated power projects  and the partial impairment of goodwill reflecting a decline in fair value from the deteriorating energy merchant market conditions 
williams also recognized asset impairments and cost write offs of certain of its assets  in large part a result of asset sale considerations and terminated projects reflecting a reduced capital expenditure program 
in addition  the board of directors reduced the common stock dividend for the third quarter from the prior level of 
per share to 
per share 
in july  the major rating agencies downgraded williams unsecured long term debt credit ratings to below investment grade  reflecting the uncertainty associated with the trading business  short term cash requirements facing williams and the increased level of debt the company had incurred to meet the wcg payment obligations and guarantees 
concurrent with these events  williams was unable to complete a renewal of its unsecured short term bank facility which expired on july  subsequently  williams and a subsidiary obtained two secured facilities totaling billion  including a letter of credit facility for million and a million short term loan rmt note payable  and amended its existing revolving credit facility  which expires july  to make it secured 
these facilities include pledges of certain assets and contain financial ratios and other covenants that must be maintained see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
included in these covenants are provisions that limit the ability to incur future indebtedness  pledge assets and pay dividends on common stock 
in addition  debt and related commitments from banks must be reduced based on proceeds of asset sales and minimum levels of required current and future liquidity were established 
if such provisions of these facilities are not adhered to  then williams lenders can declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
also following the credit rating downgrade and in response to a potential liquidity shortfall  williams sold certain exploration and production properties and substantially all of its natural gas liquids pipeline systems  receiving net cash proceeds of approximately billion and resulting in gains on sales of million million of which is reflected in discontinued operations 
these actions  combined with the rmt note payable noted previously  provided proceeds to meet notes payable maturities 
williams also sold certain liquified natural gas assets for approximately million  its percent ownership interest in a lithuanian refinery  pipeline and terminal investment for million and its million note receivable from the lithuanian investment for face value 
these transactions closed in september 
additionally in  williams board of directors had approved for sale the central natural gas pipeline unit  the soda ash mining operations  the memphis refinery  bio energy operations and the travel centers 
the sale of central closed in november the sales of the travel centers for million before debt repayments and the memphis refinery for million were completed in february and march  respectively 
the remaining assets are expected to be sold in the first half of concurrent with williams strategy of selling assets to reduce debt  reviews for impairment were performed on assets that were being considered for possible sale  including an assessment of the more likely than not probabilities of sale for each asset 
the impairment reviews are updated to incorporate new information obtained through the maturation of the assets sales process or closing of a sale 
impairments and losses totaling million on completed transactions and certain assets held for sale  are reported in discontinued operations for and an additional million of impairments or guarantee loss accruals are reported in continuing operations for these impairments reflected management s estimate of the fair value of these assets based on information available at the time of the respective reviews 
outlook for on february   williams outlined its planned business strategy for the next several years and believes it to be a comprehensive response to the events which have impacted the energy sector and williams during the plan focuses on retaining a strong  but smaller  portfolio of natural gas businesses and bolstering williams liquidity through more asset sales  limited levels of financing at the subsidiary level and additional reductions in its operating costs 
the plan is designed to provide williams with a clear strategy to address near term and medium term liquidity issues and further de leverage the company with the objective of returning to investment grade status by  while retaining businesses with favorable returns and opportunities for growth in the future 
as part of this plan  williams expects to generate proceeds  net of related debt  of nearly billion from asset sales during  including approximately billion in newly announced offerings combined with those assets already under contract or in negotiations for sale 
newly announced offerings include the texas gas pipeline system  williams investment in williams energy partners  and certain properties and assets within exploration production and midstream gas liquids 
the specific assets and the timing of such sales are dependent on various factors  including negotiations with prospective buyers  regulatory approvals  industry conditions  lender consents to sales of collateral and the short and long term liquidity requirements of williams 
while management believes it has considered all relevant information in assessing for potential impairments  the ultimate sales price for assets that may be sold and the final decisions in the future may result in additional impairments or losses and or gains 
factors affecting williams business during  the operating results of energy marketing trading were adversely affected by several factors  including williams overall liquidity and credit ratings which impacted energy marketing trading s ability to enter into price risk management and hedging activities 
the credit rating downgrades in also triggered certain energy marketing trading contractual provisions that require williams to provide counterparties with adequate assurance  margin  credit enhancement  or credit replacement 
see the liquidity section for further discussion of what amounts williams and energy marketing trading have provided 
during the later half of  several companies in the energy trading sector announced that they are either reducing commitments to  or exiting altogether  the energy trading business 
these market conditions plus the unwillingness of existing counterparties and new entrants to the sector to enter into new business with energy marketing trading will continue to affect results in the future and could result in additional operating losses 
additionally  on october   the emerging issues task force eitf concluded in issue no 
 issues related to accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  to rescind issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  under which non derivative energy trading contracts were previously marked to market 
as a result  a substantial portion of the energy marketing trading activities previously required to be reported on a fair value basis must now be reflected under the accrual method of accounting beginning january  see note 
williams continues its efforts to reduce the risk and liquidity impact of energy marketing trading on williams 
part of these efforts includes the announced sale of certain portions of its trading portfolio  liquidation of certain trading positions and negotiations with parties for a joint venture or sale of all or a large portion of the trading portfolio 
it is possible that williams  in order to generate levels of liquidity that are needed in the future  would be willing to accept amounts for all or a portion or its entire portfolio that are less than its carrying value at december  although the results of these negotiations could reduce the presence of the trading business  energy marketing trading will continue to be operated to meet the commitments of its remaining short and long term contracts 
at december   williams has maturing notes payable and long term debt totaling approximately billion which includes certain contractual fees and deferred interest associated with an underlying debt through the first quarter of the company s available liquidity to meet these requirements and fund a reduced level of capital expenditures will be dependent on several factors  including the cash flows of retained businesses  the amount of proceeds raised from the sale of assets previously mentioned and the price of natural gas 
future cash flows from operations may also be affected by the timing and nature of the sale of assets 
because of recent asset sales  anticipated asset sales and available secured credit facilities  williams currently believes that it has the financial resources and liquidity to meet future cash requirements through the first quarter of in the event that williams financial condition does not improve or becomes worse  or if it fails to complete asset sales and reduce its commitment to its energy marketing trading business  williams may have to consider other options including the possibility of seeking protection in a bankruptcy proceeding 
general as a result of assets sales approved or closed during and in accordance with the provisions related to discontinued operations within statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the following components have been reported as discontinued operations see note kern river gas transmission kern river  previously one of gas pipeline s segments central natural gas pipeline  previously one of gas pipeline s segments colorado soda ash mining operations  part of the previously reported international segment two natural gas liquids pipeline systems  mid american pipeline and seminole pipeline  previously part of the midstream gas liquids segment refining and marketing operations in the midsouth  including the midsouth refinery  previously part of the petroleum services segment retail travel centers concentrated in the midsouth  previously part of the petroleum services segment bio energy operations  previously part of the petroleum services segment on march   the board of directors of williams approved a tax free spinoff of williams communications business  wcg  to williams shareholders 
on april   williams distributed million shares  or approximately percent of the wcg common stock held by williams  to holders of record of williams common stock 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements reflect wcg as discontinued operations 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion and analysis of results of operations  financial condition and liquidity relates to the continuing operations of williams and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included within item all prior period information has been restated to reflect these changes 
critical accounting policies estimates our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the selection of these has been discussed with the company s audit committee and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures that follow 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition gas pipeline most of gas pipeline s businesses are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the ferc regulatory processes and procedures govern the tariff rates that the gas pipeline subsidiaries are permitted to charge customers for natural gas sales and services  including the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas 
accordingly  certain revenues are collected by gas pipeline which may be subject to refunds upon final orders in rate cases with the ferc 
in recording estimates of refund obligations  gas pipeline takes into consideration gas pipeline s and other third parties regulatory proceedings  advice of counsel and estimated total exposure  as discounted and risk weighted  as well as collection and other risks 
at december   approximately million was recorded as subject to refund  reflecting management s estimate of amounts invoiced to customers that may ultimately require refunding 
this balance is associated entirely with one of williams gas pipelines as there are no significant rate proceedings currently pending for the other pipelines 
during  rate refund liability accruals were reduced by million as a result of settlements of regulatory proceedings including amounts refunded to customers 
from time to time  certain of the gas pipeline subsidiaries are involved in rate case proceedings 
depending on the results of these proceedings  the actual amounts allowed to be collected from customers could differ from management s estimate 
revenue recognition energy risk management and trading operations energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported within the midstream gas liquids segment have energy risk management and trading operations that enter into energy and energy related contracts to trade with and provide price risk management services to its customers 
energy and energy related contracts utilized in energy risk management and trading activities are recorded at fair value with the net change in fair value of those contracts representing unrealized gains and losses recognized in income currently marked to market 
the fair value of energy and energy related contracts is determined based on the nature of the transaction and the market in which transactions are executed 
certain contracts are executed in exchange traded or over the counter markets where quoted prices in active markets may exist 
transactions are also executed in exchange traded or over the counter markets for which market prices may exist  however  the market may be relatively inactive and price transparency is limited 
hence  the ability to determine the fair value of the contract would be more subjective than if an independent third party quote were available 
transactions are also executed for which quoted market prices are not available 
determining fair value for certain contracts involves complex assumptions and judgments when estimating prices at which market participants would transact if a market existed for the contract or transaction 
on october   the eitf concluded in issue no 
to rescind issue no 
 under which non derivative energy trading contracts were previously marked to market 
a substantial portion of the energy marketing and trading activities previously reported on a fair value basis will now be reflected under the accrual method of accounting beginning january  in addition  trading inventories will also no longer be marked to market but will be reported on a lower of cost or market basis 
upon adoption of this new standard on january   energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported within the midstream gas liquids segment will record a charge as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the impact of this change in accounting principle is expected to result in a decrease to net income of approximately million to million in total on an after tax basis for both business units 
for further discussion on this issue  please refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for energy marketing trading s energy related contracts  which include contracts such as transportation  storage  load serving  and tolling agreements  requires williams to assess whether certain of these contracts are executory service agreements or leases pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
on january   the eitf reached a tentative consensus on issue no 
 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  and directed the working group it had formed to consider this issue to further address certain matters  including transition 
the march  report of the working group indicates the working group supports a prospective transition of this issue  where the consensus would be applied to arrangements consummated or substantively modified after the date of the final consensus 
williams preliminary review indicates that certain of its tolling agreements could be considered to be leases under the tentative consensus 
accordingly  if the eitf did not adopt a prospective transition and applied the consensus to existing arrangements there could be a significant impact to williams financial position and results of operations 
as a result of williams current liquidity constraints  energy marketing trading initiated efforts in to sell all or portions of its portfolio and or pursue potential joint venture or business combination opportunities 
no assurances can be made regarding the ultimate consummation of any sales or business combination activities currently being pursued 
energy marketing trading is continuing to evaluate its potential alternatives 
as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  portions of energy marketing trading s portfolio have been recognized at their estimated fair value  which per generally accepted accounting principles is the amount at which they could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced liquidation or sale 
given the financial condition and liquidity constraints of williams  however  amounts ultimately realized in any portfolio sales or business combination may be significantly different than fair value estimates presented in the financial statements 
additional discussion of the accounting for energy and energy related contracts at fair value is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and fair value of energy risk management and trading activities 
valuation of deferred tax assets williams is required to assess the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets generated from the basis difference in certain investments and businesses 
this assessment takes into consideration tax planning strategies  including assumptions regarding the availability and character of future taxable income 
at december   williams maintains million of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets from basis differences in investments and capital loss carry forward generated during the year for which the ultimate realization of the tax asset may be dependent on the availability of future capital gains 
in arriving at this conclusion  management considered forecasts of future company performance  particularly the estimated impact of potential asset dispositions 
the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be materially different from those recorded  as influenced by potential changes in federal income laws and the circumstances upon the actual realization of related tax assets 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill williams evaluates the long lived assets of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition to those long lived assets for which impairment charges were recorded see notes and  numerous others were reviewed for which no impairment was required under a held for use computation  pursuant to williams announced strategy of selling assets as a source of funds to meet debt obligations and provide liquidity 
these computations utilized judgments and assumptions inherent in management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows and hold for use versus sale probabilities to determine recoverability of an asset 
pursuant to williams announced strategy during of selling significant levels of assets  numerous assets were considered more likely than not to be sold substantially in advance of their established recovery periods 
to facilitate the actual sales  a reserve price auction process was employed for many of the assets 
this type of process is one in which initial bids are received by interested parties  followed by submission of revised bids  with the company eventually selecting a single party in which to finalize a sale transaction 
under terms of the process  williams is not obligated to accept an offer that it does not deem satisfactory 
as a result  both the estimated fair value of an asset and management s assessment of the probability of sale often change through the course of the process 
at december   certain assets are in various stages of sale negotiations 
with respect to the most significant of these  a ten percent decrease in estimated fair value would result in additional impairment charges of approximately million  while a ten percent increase in fair value would result in a decrease of impairment charges of approximately million 
it is possible that a computation under a held for sale situation for certain of these long lived assets could result in a significantly different assessment because of market conditions  specific transaction terms and a buyer s different viewpoint of future cash flows 
goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment 
approximately billion of williams goodwill is carried by exploration production for which the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  including goodwill  by over percent 
contingent liabilities williams records liabilities for estimated loss contingencies when it is management s assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which new or different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect the previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
liabilities for contingent losses are based upon management s assumptions and estimates  advice of legal counsel or other third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the matter 
should the outcome differ from the assumptions and estimates  revisions to the estimated liabilities for contingent losses would be required

results of operations segments williams is currently organized into the following segments energy marketing trading  gas pipeline  exploration production  midstream gas liquids  williams energy partners and petroleum services 
certain activities previously reported within the international segment have been included in other 
williams currently evaluates performance based upon segment profit loss from operations see note 
in addition to the impact to the segments as a result of discontinued operations previously discussed  the following changes occurred in effective july   management of certain operations previously conducted by energy marketing trading  international and petroleum services was transferred to midstream gas liquids 
these operations included natural gas liquids trading  activities in venezuela and a petrochemical plant  respectively 
on april   williams energy partners lp  a partially owned and consolidated entity of williams  acquired williams pipe line  an operation previously included within the petroleum services segment 
accordingly  williams pipe line s results of operations have been transferred from the petroleum services segment to the williams energy partners segment 
management of an investment in an argentine oil and gas exploration company was transferred from the previously reported international segment to the exploration production segment to align exploration and production activities 
prior period amounts have been restated to reflect these changes 
the following discussions relate to the results of operations of williams segments 
energy marketing trading years ended december  millions segment revenues   segment profit loss  vs 
energy marketing trading s revenues decreased  million  or percent  due primarily to a  million decrease in risk management and trading revenues 
during  energy marketing trading s results were adversely affected by the impact of market movements against its portfolio as discussed below and a significant reduction in origination activities 
energy marketing trading s ability to manage or hedge its portfolio against adverse market movements was limited by a lack of market liquidity as well as williams limited ability to provide credit and liquidity support 
the  million decrease in risk management and trading revenues is due primarily to a decrease of  million in the natural gas and power revenues partially offset by a million increase in the petroleum products revenues  a million increase in european trading revenues  and a million increase in revenues from the net impact of interest rate movements including the impact of interest derivatives 
the  million decrease in the risk management and trading revenues includes a million decrease in revenues from new transactions originated and contract amendments as compared to of the  million decline in natural gas and power revenues  million is attributable to a decline in natural gas revenues  caused primarily by increasing prices on short natural gas positions during the third quarter of the remaining  million decline relates to lower revenues from the power portfolio caused primarily by smaller spark spreads on certain power tolling portfolios and lower volatility the fair value of energy marketing trading s tolling agreements are adversely affected by declines in power and gas volatility compared with as well as the net impact of portfolio valuation adjustments associated with the decline in market liquidity and portfolio liquidation activities 
the million increase in petroleum products revenues is primarily due to origination activities during the first quarter of the million increase in european trading revenues is principally due to the commencement of trading activities in the european office as compared to start up activities in the european operations have now been reduced and are in the process of being wound down 
as a result of williams current liquidity constraints  energy marketing trading initiated efforts in to sell all or portions of its portfolio and or pursue potential joint venture or business combination opportunities 
no assurances can be made regarding the ultimate consummation of any sales or business combination activities currently being pursued 
energy marketing trading is continuing to pursue its potential alternatives 
as discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  portions of energy marketing trading s portfolio have been recognized at their estimated fair value  which under generally accepted accounting principles is the amount at which they could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced liquidation or sale 
as a result of information obtained through the portfolio sales efforts in  the estimated fair value of certain portions of the portfolio were adjusted to reflect viable market information received 
for those portions of the portfolio for which no viable market information was received through sales efforts  fair value has been estimated using other market based information and consistent application of valuation techniques 
portfolio valuation adjustments recognized in as a result of new market information obtained through sales efforts resulted in a million decrease in operating profit 
given the financial condition and liquidity constraints of williams which may accelerate sales  amounts ultimately realized in any portfolio sales or business combination may be significantly different than fair value estimates presented in the financial statements  depending on the timing and terms of any such transactions 
revenues for also includes a favorable fourth quarter net effect of approximately million resulting from a settlement with the state of california  the restructuring of associated energy contracts  and the related improved credit situation of the counterparties during the quarter 
energy marketing trading s future results will be affected by the reduction in liquidity and credit support available from its parent  the willingness of counterparties to enter into transactions with energy marketing trading  the liquidity of markets in which energy marketing trading transacts  and the creditworthiness of other counterparties in the industry and their ability to perform under contractual obligations 
since williams is not currently rated investment grade by credit rating agencies  williams is required  in certain instances  to provide additional adequate assurances in the form of cash or credit support to enter into and maintain existing transactions 
with the decision to continue to limit williams financial commitment and exposure to the trading business  it is likely that energy marketing trading will have greater exposure to market movements  which could result in additional operating losses 
in addition  other companies in the energy trading and marketing sector are experiencing financial difficulties which will affect energy marketing trading s credit and default assessment related to the future value of its forward positions and the ability of such counterparties to perform under contractual obligations 
the ultimate outcome of these items could result in significant future operating losses for energy marketing trading or limit energy marketing trading s ability to achieve profitable operations 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased by million  or percent 
this cost reduction is primarily due to lower variable compensation levels associated with reduced segment profit and the impact of staff reductions in this segment 
other income expense net in includes million of impairments and loss accruals associated with commitments for certain power projects that have been terminated  partial impairment of goodwill totaling million  reflecting a decline in fair value resulting from deteriorating market conditions during and a million impairment charge related to the january sale of the worthington generation facility 
other income expense net in included million due to a terminated expansion project 
segment profit loss decreased  million  or percent  due primarily to the  million reduction of risk management and trading revenues and the other income expense net items discussed previously  partially offset by the million reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses  discussed above  and the million charge from the write downs in of marketable equity securities and a cost based investment see note 
on october   the eitf concluded in issue no 
to rescind issue no 
 under which non derivative energy trading contracts were marked to market 
a substantial portion of the energy marketing and trading activities previously reported on a fair value basis will now be reflected under the accrual method of accounting beginning january  certain of the trading activities utilizing derivative instruments will continue to be reported on a fair value basis to the extent that these instruments are not designated as hedges under sfas no 
the related changes in fair value will be reported as unrealized gains or losses in the consolidated income statement 
in addition  trading inventories will no longer be marked to market but will be reported on a lower of cost or market basis 
upon adoption of this new standard on january   energy marketing trading will record a charge as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
energy marketing trading s portion of the impact of this change in accounting principle is expected to be a decrease to net income of approximately million to million on an after tax basis 
for further discussion on this issue  please refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
contingent liabilities and commitments that could affect the results of energy marketing trading  including a recent settlement between the ferc and transcontinental gas pipe line  energy marketing trading and williams are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
vs 
energy marketing trading s revenues increased by million  or percent in  due primarily to a million increase in risk management and trading revenues 
the million increase in risk management and trading revenues results primarily from an increase in risk management activities surrounding energy marketing trading s power tolling portfolio 
as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  power tolling agreements provide energy marketing trading the right  but not the obligation  to call on the counterparty to convert natural gas to electricity at a predefined heat conversion rate 
energy marketing trading benefited from higher natural gas and electric power services margins through the first quarter of from power tolling agreements previously recognized in energy marketing trading  through its origination of new contracts  executed several offsetting positions throughout the year to mitigate declines in these margins that occurred subsequent to the first quarter these new contracts consisted of full requirements  load serving and power supply agreements and typically have terms of up to years 
execution of these contracts had the effect of reducing the risk of future changes in natural gas and power prices within the portfolio and also provided further insight into the prices for which third parties would be willing to exchange in illiquid periods 
this additional insight provided better information for the valuation of other existing contracts which generally had the effect of increasing the value recognized on these existing contracts 
subsequent to the execution of these origination transactions  natural gas and power prices declined dramatically 
as a result of energy marketing trading s management strategies  this reduction had minimal impact to the overall portfolio fair value 
also contributing to the increase in the risk management and trading revenues during was an increase in successful forward natural gas financial trading 
through a variety of energy commodity and derivative contracts  energy marketing trading had credit exposure to enron and certain of its subsidiaries which have sought protection from creditors under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
during fourth quarter  energy marketing trading recorded a reduction in trading revenues of approximately million through the valuation of contracts with enron 
approximately million of this reduction in value was recorded pursuant to events immediately preceding and following enron s announced bankruptcy 
at december   williams had reduced its exposure to accounts receivable from enron  net of margin deposits  to expected recoverable amounts 
in  energy marketing trading sold rights to certain enron receivables to a third party in exchange for million cash 
that amount was recorded as trading revenues in the first quarter of selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million  or percent 
this cost increase was primarily due to million higher variable compensation levels associated with improved operating performance  million of costs related to the european trading and marketing office in london which began operation in  million of increased charitable contributions to state universities  as well as increased outside services costs and increased costs as a result of higher staffing levels 
other income expense net in includes a million impairment charge due to a terminated expansion project 
in  other income expense net included million in guarantee loss accruals and impairment charges and million impairment of assets related to a distributed generation business 
segment profit increased million  or percent  due primarily to the million higher trading revenues discussed above and the effect of the million of guarantee loss accruals and impairment charges in noted above 
partially offsetting the increase to segment profit was the million increase in selling  general and administrative costs  as discussed above  million of write downs in of marketable equity securities and a cost based investment and the million impairment in noted above 
potential impact of california power regulation and litigation at december   energy marketing trading had net accounts receivable recorded of approximately million compared to million at december   for power sales to the california independent system operator and the california power exchange corporation cpec 
in march and april of  two california power related entities  the cpec and pacific gas and electric company pg e  filed for bankruptcy under chapter while the amount recorded reflects management s best estimate of collectibility  future events or circumstances could change those estimates 
as discussed in rate and regulatory matters and related litigation in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the ferc and the doj have issued orders or initiated actions that relate to the activities of energy marketing trading in california and the western states 
in addition to these federal agency actions  a number of federal and state initiatives addressing the issues of the california electric power industry are also ongoing and may result in restructuring of various markets in california and elsewhere 
discussions in california and other states have ranged from threats of re regulation to suspension of plans to move forward with deregulation 
allegations have also been made that the wholesale price increases experienced in and resulted from the exercise of market power and collusion of the power generators and sellers  including energy marketing trading 
these allegations have resulted in multiple state and federal investigations as well as the filing of class action lawsuits in which energy marketing trading is a named defendant 
energy marketing trading s long term power contract with the state of california has also been challenged both at the ferc and in civil suits 
most of these initiatives  investigations and proceedings are in their preliminary stages and their likely outcome cannot be estimated 
however  energy marketing trading and williams executed a settlement agreement on november   that is intended to resolve many of these disputes with the state of california and that includes renegotiated long term energy contracts 
the settlement is also intended to resolve complaints brought by the california attorney general against energy marketing trading and the state of california s refund claims 
in addition  the settlement is intended to resolve ongoing investigations by the states of california  oregon  and washington 
the settlement is subject to various court and agency approvals see other legal matters in note 
there can be no assurance that these initiatives  investigations and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on williams results of operations or financial condition

exploration production years ended december  millions segment revenues segment profit on february   williams announced additional assets to be sold including exploration production properties 
depending on the nature and size of the sales  future operating results could be impacted significantly 
vs 
exploration production s revenues increased million  or percent  due primarily to million higher domestic production revenues  million in unrealized gains from the mark to market financial instruments related to basis differentials on natural gas production  partially offset by million lower domestic gas management revenues 
the million increase in domestic production revenues includes million associated with an increase in net domestic production volumes as well as million from increased net realized average prices for production including the effect of hedge positions 
the increase in net production volumes mainly results from the acquisition in third quarter of the former barrett operations 
approximately percent of domestic production in was hedged 
exploration production has entered into contracts that hedge approximately percent of projected domestic natural gas production before consideration of any potential property sales in these hedges are entered into with energy marketing trading which in turn  enters into offsetting derivative contracts with unrelated third parties 
energy marketing trading bears the counterparty performance risks associated with unrelated third parties 
during  a portion of the external derivative contracts was with enron  which filed for bankruptcy in december as a result  the contracts were effectively liquidated due to contractual terms concerning bankruptcy and energy marketing trading recorded estimated charges for the credit exposure 
during the third quarter of  energy marketing trading had additional contracts not related to enron that were terminated 
the other comprehensive income related to these terminated contracts remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized as the underlying volumes are produced 
during  approximately million related to the terminated contracts was recognized as revenues while million remains in accumulated other comprehensive income at december  domestic gas management revenues consist primarily of marketing activities within the exploration production segment that are not a direct part of the results of operations for producing activities 
these non producing activities include acquisition and disposition of other working interest and royalty interest gas and the movement of gas from the wellhead to the tailgate of the respective plants for sale to energy marketing trading or third parties 
costs and operating expenses  including selling  general and administrative expenses  increased million  due primarily to increased depreciation  depletion and amortization  lease operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses due primarily to the addition of the former barrett operations 
the increases were partially offset by decreased gas management purchase costs 
other income expense net in includes million and million in gains from the sales of substantially all of the interests in natural gas production properties in the jonah field wyoming and in the anadarko basin  respectively 
the jonah field properties represented approximately percent of total reserves at december   the absence of which could impact future revenue levels 
segment profit increased million due primarily to the gains from asset sales mentioned above  increased production volumes  and higher net realized average prices 
segment profit also includes million and million related to international activities for and  respectively 
vs 
exploration production s revenues increased million  or percent  due primarily to million higher domestic production revenues including million from increased net realized prices for production including the effect of hedge positions and million associated with an increase in net volumes from domestic production 
approximately million of the million increase relates to volumes associated with barrett  which became a consolidated entity on august  approximately percent of domestic production in was hedged 
revenues from domestic gas management activities increased million 
segment costs and operating expenses increased million  including a million increase in selling  general and administrative expense 
segment costs and operating expenses increased due primarily to costs related to barrett operations  comprised primarily of depreciation  depletion and amortization  lease operating expenses and gas management costs 
in addition to the increase as a result of the barrett acquisition  the higher segment costs and operating expenses reflect million higher domestic lease operating expenses  million higher domestic depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses and million higher domestic production related taxes 
other income expense net in includes a million impairment charge for certain gas producing properties 
the charge represented the impairment of these held for sale assets to fair value based on expected net proceeds 
these properties were sold in march segment profit increased million  or percent  due primarily to the higher domestic production revenues in excess of costs 
a major portion of this increase can be attributed to the barrett acquisition 
in addition  segment profit included million in equity earnings from the percent investment in barrett held by williams for the period from june  through august   partially offset by million lower equity earnings from an argentina oil and gas investment 
midstream gas liquids years ended december  millions segment revenues    segment profit in august  williams completed the sale of percent of mapletree llc and percent of e oaktree  llc to enterprise products partners lp mapletree owned all of mid america pipeline  a  mile natural gas liquids pipeline system 
e oaktree owned percent of the seminole pipeline  a  mile natural gas liquids pipeline system 
the gains on the sale of these businesses and the related results of operations have been reported as discontinued operations 
williams has also announced the intended sale of additional assets  including certain operations in canada 
future asset sales would have the effect of lowering liquid product sales in periods following their sale but are expected to be offset by increasing deepwater or gathering and transportation revenue 
the following discussion reflects the results of midstream gas liquids continuing operations 
vs midstream gas liquids revenues increased million as a result of a million increase in domestic gathering  processing  transportation and liquid product sales revenues  a million increase in venezuelan revenues and a million increase in canadian revenues  offset by a million decline in domestic petrochemical and trading revenues 
the million increase in domestic gathering  processing  transportation and liquid product sales revenues was driven by a million increase in liquid sales  a million increase in liquid product sales from gulf liquids  a new off gas processing and olefin extraction facility that became a consolidated subsidiary in september and a million increase in transportation revenues 
partially offsetting these increases is a million decrease in gathering revenues primarily due to the third quarter sale of the kansas hugoton gathering system 
the increase in liquid sales reflects a million increase in gulf coast liquid sales resulting from higher production at existing processing facilities and the september completion of a new processing facility that processes natural gas gathered from deepwater projects off the coast of texas 
offsetting the increase in gulf coast liquid sales was a million decline in liquid sales in the west  primarily caused by a decline in average liquid sales prices 
the million increase in transportation revenues reflects the results of a new deepwater oil and gas transportation system which was completely operational by mid year 
the million decline in petrochemicals and trading revenues is due largely to a change in the reporting during september of certain petrochemical and liquid product trading transactions from a gross revenue basis to a net revenue basis combined with lower natural gas liquid trading margins 
the million increase in venezuelan revenues reflects a full year of results from a new gas compression facility that began operations in august the increase in canadian revenues results from a million increase in natural gas liquids product sales from fractionation activities reflecting a percent increase in volumes 
the increase in volumes sold was partially offset by a percent decline in average liquid product sales prices 
the increase in volumes resulted from improvements made at a parafins facility and higher volumes of natural gas liquid supply from processing facilities within northern alberta and british columbia 
the increase in canadian revenues is partially offset by a million decrease in processing revenues reflecting lower processing rates under cost of service agreements as a result of lower natural gas shrink prices combined with a million decrease in liquid sales from processing activities which reflects lower average liquid sales prices 
costs and operating expenses decreased million  or percent  primarily reflecting a decline in fuel and product shrink costs at the wyoming and canadian processing facilities of million and million million from costs under cost of service processing agreements  respectively 
these decreases reflect lower average natural gas prices in canada and wyoming  offset by higher volumes and prices in the gulf coast 
the lower average gas prices in wyoming during reflect a favorable differential between gas prices in wyoming and the gulf as a result of limited transportation capacity from wyoming to other markets 
this favorable basis differential had the effect of lower shrink costs and increasing liquid sales margins from wyoming processing plants and is not expected to continue once take away transportation capacity within this region has been expanded 
costs and operating expenses also reflect a million decline in petrochemical and trading costs resulting from the change in reporting certain product trading classifications in september  as discussed above 
partially offsetting these decreases are million of higher product shrink costs at gulf liquids operations  million higher depreciation costs from the addition of gulf liquids and other new facilities combined with million higher transportation  fractionation  and marketing costs 
operations and maintenance expenses were relatively unchanged on a segment basis  with a million decline in costs in the west primarily resulting from lower maintenance spending  offset by a corresponding increase in the gulf  canada and venezuela largely driven by the higher maintenance costs resulting from the new venezuelan gas compression facility  canadian olefins facility  the gulf liquids facilities and new deepwater offshore operations 
selling  general and administrative costs increased million primarily due to the consolidation of gulf liquids during other income expense net within segment costs and expense for includes a million impairment associated with the canadian processing  extraction and olefin extraction assets see note and a million impairment associated with the sale of the kansas hugoton gathering system in the third quarter 
reflected in are million of impairment charges related to certain south texas non regulated gathering and processing assets 
segment profit of million for was largely impacted by a million impairment on canadian natural gas processing  extraction and olefin extraction assets during the fourth quarter 
before this impairment charge  midstream gas liquids segment profit reflects a million increase over this increase reflects a million increase in domestic operations  a million increase in venezuelan operations and a million increase in canadian operations 
domestic segment profit reflects a million increase in liquid sales margins resulting from the low fuel and shrink costs in the west reflecting the wide basis differential for natural gas prices in wyoming 
domestic segment profit also increased million due to income from equity investments primarily related to significant improvements in the operations of discovery pipeline following new supply connections that resulted in higher transportation and liquid volumes 
domestic segment profit was also impacted by a million increase in profits from an increase in deepwater operations  offset by million in losses resulting from operational issues associated with gulf liquids 
the increase in segment profit from canadian operations excluding the million impairment discussed above resulted from a million increase in liquid product margins from fractionation activities due to higher liquid sales volumes and prices combined with a million increase in liquid sales margins from processing activities primarily resulting from lower shrink costs 
offsetting these increases are higher depreciation  and operations and maintenance expense primarily resulting from the new olefins fractionation facility 
segment profit from venezuelan operations reflects an increase resulting from a full year of results following the completion of a new gas compression facility in august midstream gas liquids venezuelan assets were constructed and are currently operated for the exclusive benefit of petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa  the state owned petroleum corporation of venezuela 
during december and january  a countrywide strike took place within venezuela that resulted in significant political instability and a volatile economic environment 
employees of pdvsa joined this strike  which had an impact on the operations of most of the venezuelan facilities 
all owned facilities are presently operating 
however  an operating agreement for the pdvsa owned oil terminaling facility is the subject of a contract dispute with pdvsa 
the ultimate impact the political and economic situation within venezuela will have on midstream gas and liquids revenues  segment profits and operating cash flows will depend upon the extent and duration of the political and economic instability and the enforceability of certain contractual arrangements provisions with pdvsa 
vs 
midstream gas liquids revenues increased million  or percent  due primarily to million in revenues for the first three quarters of from canadian operations that were acquired in october the million of increased revenues from canadian operations consists primarily of million of natural gas liquids sales from processing activities  million of natural gas liquids sales from fractionation activities  and million of processing revenues 
canadian revenues decreased million for the comparable periods of and due primarily to natural gas liquids product sales price decline 
revenues were million higher due to a new venezuelan gas compression facility which began operations in august revenues from domestic natural gas liquids trading operations decreased million due primarily to declining prices on ethane and lower ethelyne volumes and prices related to marketing of products of a petrochemical plant acquired by williams in early  as well as a change in the reporting during of certain petrochemical and liquid product trading transactions from a gross revenue basis to a net revenue basis 
domestic natural gas liquids revenues decreased million including million from percent lower volumes sold and million due to lower average natural gas liquids sales prices 
the percent decrease in volumes sold is due primarily to less favorable processing economics 
additionally  there were million lower revenues related to the petrochemical plant due to a plant turnaround in first quarter and curtailed production 
domestic gathering revenues increased million due primarily to higher volumes related to recent asset acquisitions in the gulf coast area 
costs and operating expenses increased million to billion  due primarily to million of costs and operating expenses related to the canadian operations for the first three quarters of and million higher domestic general operating and maintenance costs and million related to the new gas compression facility in venezuela 
partially offsetting these increases were million lower expenses related to decreased ethane prices for the natural gas liquids trading operations  million lower canadian costs and operating expenses for the comparable periods of and due to lower shrink gas replacement costs  million lower domestic shrink gas replacement costs and the effect in of million of losses associated with certain propane storage transactions 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or percent  due primarily to million of general and administrative expenses related to the canadian operations for the first three quarters of and higher general and administrative expenses for natural gas liquids trading operations  partially offset by million of reorganization and early retirement costs incurred in included in other income expense net within segment costs and expenses for is million of impairment charges related to management s decisions and commitments to sell certain south texas non regulated gathering and processing assets 
the charges represent the impairment of the assets to fair value based on expected proceeds from the sales 
these sales closed during first quarter also included in other income expense net within segment costs and expenses for is a million gain on the sale of certain natural gas liquids contracts 
segment profit decreased million  or percent  due primarily to million from lower average per unit domestic natural gas liquids margins and million from decreased domestic natural gas liquids volumes sold  million lower margins from natural gas liquids trading activity  million higher domestic operating and maintenance costs  million lower operating profit from activities at the petrochemical plant as revenues decreased due to plant turnaround and curtailed production without a corresponding decrease in cost  million and million due to the impairment charge and the gain on sale of certain natural gas liquids contracts discussed above and million higher losses from equity investments 
partially offsetting these decreases to segment profit were an million increase from the new venezuelan gas compression facility which began operations in third quarter  million lower domestic general and administrative expenses  million higher domestic gathering revenues and million of losses associated with certain propane storage transactions during williams energy partners years ended december  millions segment revenues segment profit on february   williams announced that it is pursuing a potential sale of its investment in williams energy partners lp  including its general partner interest 
vs 
williams energy partners revenue increased million  or percent  reflecting increased revenues from petroleum products transportation  terminal and other activities 
transportation revenues increased as a result of higher average transportation rates slightly offset by lower volumes 
the increase in average transportation rates were due to supply shifts within the williams pipe line system  caused by the temporary capacity reductions of certain refineries  which created longer hauls during the current year 
these refinery capacity reductions are not anticipated to recur in the increase in terminals and other revenues principally reflect increased utilization and higher rates 
in addition  results benefited from the full year impact of acquisitions made during  which include two inland terminals and one marine terminal facility 
costs and operating expenses increased million due primarily to million of higher environmental expense accruals  a full year of operating expenses related to the marine facility and two inland terminals discussed above  and higher third party pipeline lease expenses 
most of the increase in environmental expenses resulted from the completion of state mandated environmental assessments at six terminal facilities on the pipeline system during the current year 
these increases were partially offset by lower transportation field expenses principally reflecting maintenance cost reduction measures implemented in the current year 
segment profit decreased million  or percent  due to the items discussed above  million higher selling  general and administrative expenses and decreased other income of million 
general and administrative costs increased due to costs incurred during by williams energy partners relating to the acquisition of williams pipe line  increased allocations from williams and increased equity based incentive compensation expense

in addition  williams sold its million note receivable from the lithuanian operations at face value 
fair value of energy risk management and trading activities as more thoroughly described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  energy and energy related contracts are carried at fair value and  with the exception of certain commodity inventories  are recorded in current and noncurrent energy risk management and trading assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
fair value of energy and energy related contracts is determined based on the nature of the transaction and market in which transactions are executed 
certain transactions are executed in exchange traded or over the counter markets for which quoted prices in active periods exist  while other transactions are executed where quoted market prices are not available or the contracts extend into periods for which quoted market prices are not available 
quoted market prices for varying periods in active markets are readily available for valuing forward contracts  futures contracts  swap agreements and purchase and sales transactions in the commodity markets in which energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations transact 
market data in active periods is also available for interest rate transactions affecting the trading portfolio 
for contracts or transactions that extend into periods for which actively quoted prices are not available  energy marketing trading estimates energy commodity prices in the illiquid periods by incorporating information obtained from commodity prices in actively quoted markets  prices reflected in current transactions and market fundamental analysis 
for contracts where quoted market prices are not available  primarily transportation  storage  full requirements  load serving and power tolling contracts  energy marketing trading estimates fair value using proprietary models and other valuation techniques that reflect the best information available under the circumstances 
in situations where energy marketing trading has received current information from negotiation activities with potential buyers of these contracts  the information is considered in the determination of the fair value of the contract 
the valuation techniques used when estimating fair value for energy related contracts incorporate option pricing theory  statistical and simulation analysis  present value concepts incorporating risk from uncertainty of the timing and amount of estimated cash flows and specific contractual terms 
the estimates of fair value also assume liquidating the positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time in a transaction between a willing buyer and seller 
these valuation techniques utilize factors such as quoted energy commodity market prices  estimates of energy commodity market prices in the absence of quoted market prices  volatility factors underlying the positions  estimated correlation of energy commodity prices  contractual volumes  estimated volumes under option and other arrangements  liquidity of the market in which the contract is transacted  and a risk free market discount rate 
fair value also reflects a risk premium that market participants would consider in their determination of fair value 
regardless of the method for which fair value is determined  the recognized fair value of all contracts also considers the risk of non performance and credit considerations of the counterparty 
the estimates of fair value are adjusted as assumptions change or as transactions become closer to settlement and enhanced estimates become available 
in some cases  energy marketing trading enters into price risk management contracts that have forward start dates commencing upon completion of construction and development of assets to be owned and operated by third parties 
until construction commences  revenue recognition and the fair value of these contracts is limited to the amount of any guaranty or similar form of acceptable credit support that encourages the counterparty to perform under the terms of the contract with appropriate consideration for any contractual provisions that provide for contract termination by the counterparty 
information used in determining the significant estimates and assumptions utilized in the determination of fair value of energy related contracts is derived from market fundamental analysis 
interpreting this data requires judgment and energy marketing trading recognizes that others in the market place might interpret this data differently 
it is reasonably possible that different interpretations of this data could result in a different estimation of fair value in periods for which estimates and assumptions are significant components of estimating fair value 
in estimating fair value  energy marketing trading considers how it believes others in the market place would interpret this information in order to further validate that the estimates and assumptions used in estimating fair value provides the best estimate of the amount that active market participants would exchange in an arms length transaction 
once offsetting contracts are entered into to mitigate commodity price risk  the reliance on management s assumptions and estimates utilized in the estimation of the fair value of each contract becomes less significant 
however  the assumptions and estimates surrounding counterparty performance and credit are still an integral component in the estimation of fair value for these contracts 
energy marketing trading enhances its valuation techniques  models and significant estimates and assumptions as better information about the markets in which energy marketing trading transacts becomes available 
on october   the eitf  concluded in issue no 
to rescind issue no 
 under which non derivative energy trading contracts were previously marked to market 
a substantial portion of the energy marketing and trading activities previously reported on a fair value basis will be reflected under the accrual method of accounting beginning january  in addition  trading inventories will no longer be marked to market but will be reported on a lower of cost or market basis 
upon adoption of this new standard on january  energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported in the midstream gas liquids segment will record a charge as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the impact of this change in accounting principle is expected to be a decrease to net income of million to million on an after tax basis 
for further discussion on this issue  please refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
methods of estimating fair value quoted prices in active markets quoted market prices for varying periods in active markets are readily available for valuing forward contracts  futures contracts  swap agreements and purchase and sales transactions in the commodity markets in which energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported in the midstream gas liquids segment transact 
these prices reflect the economic and regulatory conditions that currently exist in the market place and are subject to change in the near term due to changes in future market conditions 
the availability of quoted market prices in active markets varies between periods and commodities based upon changes in market conditions 
quoted prices and other external factors in less active markets for contracts or transactions extending into periods for which actively quoted prices are not available  energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations estimate energy commodity prices in these illiquid periods by incorporating information about commodity prices in actively quoted markets  quoted prices in less active markets  and other market fundamental analysis 
while an active market may not exist for the entire period  quoted prices can generally be obtained for natural gas through  power through  crude and refined products through and natural gas liquids through the ability to obtain quoted market prices varies greatly from region to region  and the time periods mentioned above are an estimation of aggregate liquidity 
prices reflected in current transactions executed by energy marketing trading are used to further validate the estimates of these prices 
the ability to validate prices has been limited due to the recent decline in overall market liquidity 
models and other valuation techniques contracts for which quoted market prices are not available primarily include transportation  storage  full requirements  load serving  transmission  and power tolling contracts energy related contracts 
a description of these contracts is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
energy marketing trading estimates fair value using models and other valuation techniques that reflect the best available information under the circumstances 
the valuation techniques incorporate option pricing theory  statistical and simulation analysis  present value concepts incorporating risk from uncertainty of the timing and amount of estimated cash flows and specific contractual terms 
factors utilized in the valuation techniques include quoted energy commodity market prices  estimates of energy commodity market prices in the absence of quoted market prices  the risk free market discount rate  volatility factors underlying the positions  estimated correlation of energy commodity prices  contractual volumes  estimated volumes  liquidity of the market in which the contract is transacted and a risk premium that market participants would consider in their determination of fair value 
although quoted market prices are not available for these energy related contracts themselves  quoted market prices for the underlying energy commodities are a significant component in the valuation of these contracts 
each of the methods discussed above also include counterparty performance and credit consideration in the estimation of fair value 
the chart below reflects the fair value of energy risk management and trading contracts for energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported in the midstream gas liquids segment by valuation methodology and the period in which the recorded fair value is expected to be realized 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements regarding the estimated impact of the company s january  adoption of eitf issue no

to be to be to be to be to be realized in realized in realized in realized in realized in months months months months months total fair year years years years years value valuation technique millions based upon quoted prices in active markets and  quoted prices other external factors in less liquid markets change based upon models other valuation techniques change total  change  a significant portion of the value expected to be realized relates to contracts within the california power market 
the terms of these agreements provide for the sale of power at fixed prices ranging from to per megawatt hour at varying volumes through for up to megawatts per hour  and a unit specific dispatchable fuel conversion service with fixed capacity prices ranging from to per kilowatt year at varying capacities of up to  megawatts through quoted market prices of the underlying commodities are significant factors in estimating the fair value 
significant estimates and assumptions used in the valuation estimation process the most significant estimates and assumptions used to estimate the value of energy and energy related contracts that extend beyond liquidly traded time periods include estimates of natural gas  power  and refined products market prices in illiquid periods  estimates of volatility and correlation of natural gas  power and refined products prices  estimates of risk inherent in estimating cash flows  and estimates and assumptions regarding counterparty performance and credit considerations 
estimates of natural gas  power  and refined products market prices in illiquid periods natural gas  power  and refined products prices are the most significant commodity prices impacting the fair value of energy marketing trading contracts at december  in estimating natural gas  power  and refined products prices during illiquid periods  energy marketing trading includes factors such as quoted market prices  prices of current market transactions and market fundamental analysis 
market fundamental analysis incorporates the most recent market data from industry publications  regulatory publications  existing and forecasted electricity generation capacity  natural gas reserve data  alternative fuel source availability  weather patterns and other indicative information supporting supply and demand relationships 
these estimated market prices are highly dependent upon actively quoted market prices for natural gas  power  and refined products  current economic and regulatory conditions  as well as  information supporting future conditions that would affect the supply and demand relationships 
alternative methods for determining prices in illiquid periods could materially impact management s estimate of fair value 
as new information is obtained about market prices during illiquid periods  energy marketing trading incorporates this information in its estimates of market prices 
such new information includes additional executed transactions extending into these periods 
these transactions give insight into the market prices for which market participants are willing to buy or sell in arms length transactions 
estimation of volatility and correlation of natural gas  power  and refined products prices volatility of natural gas  power  and refined products prices represents a significant assumption in the determination of fair value of contracts that contain optionality and whose fair value is estimated using option pricing models 
correlation of natural gas  power  and refined products prices represents a significant assumption in the determination of fair value of contracts that contain optionality and involve multiple commodities and whose fair value is estimated using option pricing models 
volatility and correlation can be implied from option based market transactions during periods when quoted market prices exist for natural gas and power 
volatility and correlation are estimated in periods during which quoted market prices are not available through quantitative analysis of historical volatility patterns of the commodities  expected future changes in estimated natural gas  power  and refined products prices  and market fundamental analysis 
estimates of volatility and correlation significantly impact the estimation of fair value for all periods in which the contract is valued using option pricing models 
alternative methods for determining volatilities and correlations in illiquid periods could materially impact management s estimate of fair value 
estimates of risk inherent in estimating cash flows risk inherent in estimating cash flows represents the uncertainty of events occurring in the future which could ultimately affect the realization of cash flows 
energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported in the midstream gas liquids segment estimate the risk active market participants would include in the price exchanged in an arms length transaction in the estimation of fair value for each contract 
energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operation estimate risk utilizing the capital asset pricing theory in the estimation of fair value of energy related contracts 
the capital asset pricing theory considers that investors require a higher return for contracts perceived to embody higher risk of uncertainty in the market 
this risk is most significant in illiquid periods and markets 
factors affecting the estimate of risk include liquidity of the market in which the contract is executed  ability to transact in future periods  existence of similar transactions in the market  uncertainty of timing and amounts of cash flows  and market fundamental analysis 
estimates and assumptions regarding counterparty performance and credit considerations energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported in the midstream gas liquids segment includes in its estimate of fair value for all contracts an assessment of the risk of counterparty non performance 
such assessment considers the credit rating of each counterparty as represented by public rating agencies such as standard poor s and moody s investor s service  the inherent default probabilities within these ratings  the regulatory environment that the contract is subject to  as well as the terms of each individual contract 
the gross forward credit exposure from energy trading and price risk management activities for energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported in the midstream gas liquids segment as of december  is summarized below 
investment counterparty type grade a total millions gas and electric utilities   energy marketers and traders   financial institutions   other   credit reserves gross credit exposure from energy risk management trading activities b  energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported in the midstream gas liquids segment assess its credit exposure on a net basis when appropriate and contractually allowed 
the net forward credit exposure from energy trading and price risk management activities as of december  is summarized as below 
investment counterparty type grade a total millions gas and electric utilities   energy marketers and traders financial institutions other credit reserves net credit exposure from energy risk management trading activities b  a investment grade is primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings along with consideration of cash  standby letters of credit  parent company guarantees  and property interests  including oil and gas reserves 
included in investment grade are counterparties with a minimum standard poor s and moody s investors service rating of bbb or baa  respectively 
b one counterparty within the california power market represents greater than ten percent of assets from energy risk management and trading activities and is included in investment grade 
standard poor s and moody s investor s service do not currently rate this counterparty 
however  recent bond issuances by this counterparty have been rated as investment grade by the various rating agencies 
this counterparty has been included in the investment grade column based upon contractual credit requirements in the event of assignment or novation 
certain of energy marketing trading s counterparties have experienced significant declines in their financial stability and creditworthiness which may adversely impact their ability to perform under contracts with energy marketing trading 
in  energy marketing trading closed out trading positions with a number of counterparties and has disputes associated with certain portions of this liquidation 
one counterparty has disputed a settlement amount related to the liquidation of a trading position with energy marketing trading 
the amount of settlement is in excess of million payable to energy marketing trading 
the matter is being arbitrated 
credit constraints  declines in market liquidity  and financial instability of market participants are expected to continue and potentially grow in continued liquidity and credit constraints of williams may also significantly impact energy marketing trading s ability to manage market risk and meet contractual obligations 
in addition to credit risk  energy marketing trading is subject to performance risk of parties with which it has significant contracts such as tolling agreements 
currently  approximately  megawatts of energy marketing trading s tolling portfolio are subject to agreements with subsidiaries of the aes corporation 
the ability of energy marketing trading to realize future estimated fair values may be significantly affected by the ability of such tolling parties to perform as contractually required 
electricity and natural gas markets  in california and elsewhere  continue to be subject to numerous and wide ranging federal and state regulatory proceedings and investigations  as well as civil actions  regarding among other things  market structure  behavior of market participants  market prices  and reporting to trade publications 
energy marketing trading may be liable for refunds and other damages and penalties as a part of these actions 
each of these matters as well as other regulatory and legal matters related to energy marketing trading are discussed in more detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the outcome of these matters could affect the creditworthiness and ability to perform contractual obligations of energy marketing trading as well as the creditworthiness and ability to perform contractual obligations of other market participants 
changes in fair value during the fair value of energy risk management and trading contracts for energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported in the midstream gas liquids segment decreased million  or percent  during the following table reflects the changes in fair value between december  and december  millions fair value of contracts outstanding at december   recognized losses included in the fair value of contracts outstanding at december  expected to be realized during the period initial recorded value of new or amended contracts entered into during the period changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques other changes in fair value of contracts fair value of contracts outstanding at december   this category includes certain balance sheet reclassifications made in that did not impact earnings 
this category includes changes in the fair market value of contracts outstanding as a result of various market movements including changes in market prices  market volatility  and market liquidity and changes in the net balance of option premiums paid and received 
option premiums paid and received are included in the fair value of contracts outstanding during any given period as they are a portion of the overall energy trading portfolio 
option premiums paid result in an initial increase in the fair value of contracts outstanding and a decrease in cash  premiums received result in an initial decrease in the fair value of contracts outstanding and an increase in cash 
the underlying value of the options associated with the premium payments are also included in the fair value of contracts outstanding 
changes in fair value during include the realization of cash flows on contracts outstanding at december  that were expected to be realized during these amounts may have differed from the values that were actually realized during due to changes in market prices  the creditworthiness of counterparties  and other factors that occurred during prior to the realization of those cash flows 
during  energy marketing trading recognized revenues resulting from the execution of new long term contracts providing for energy price risk management services to customers 
see energy marketing trading s results of operations for a discussion of the type of contracts executed during the year 
the fair value of new contracts at the time they are executed reflect the prices negotiated in long term contracts which includes the premium energy marketing trading receives for managing the energy price risk of its customers 
additionally  as further discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  energy marketing trading does not recognize revenue on contracts until all requirements for revenue recognition have been achieved 
as a result  the fair value of these contracts at the time they were executed is likely to differ from the fair value of the contracts at the time they were initially recognized in the financial statements due to changes in market prices and other factors that may have occurred during the intervening period 
energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported in the midstream gas liquids segment continuously evaluate the valuation techniques and models used in estimating fair value and modify and implement new valuation techniques based upon emerging financial theory in order to provide a better estimate of fair value 
changes attributable to market movements reflect the change in fair value of contracts resulting from changes in quoted market prices of commodities  interest rates  volatility and correlation of commodity prices 
this also includes improvements in the estimates and assumptions that energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported in the midstream gas liquids segment use in estimating fair value based upon new information and data available in the marketplace 
financial condition and liquidity liquidity williams liquidity comes from both internal and external sources 
certain of those sources are available to williams the parent and others are available to certain of its subsidiaries 
williams sources of liquidity consist of the following cash equivalent investments at the corporate level of billion at december   as compared to billion at december  cash and cash equivalent investments of various international and domestic entities other than williams energy partners of million at december  as compared to million at december  cash generated from operations and the future sales of certain assets 
million available under williams revolving credit facility at december   as compared to million at december  this credit facility is available to the extent that it is not used to satisfy the financial ratios and other covenants under certain credit agreements 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the borrowing capacity under this facility will reduce as assets are sold 
million remaining at december   under a new million secured short term letter of credit facility obtained in third quarter in april  williams filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to enable it to issue up to billion of a variety of debt and equity securities 
this registration statement was declared effective june  because of williams debt rating and loan covenant restrictions  it is unlikely that williams would be able to issue securities under the shelf registration statement in the near term 
in addition  there are outstanding registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission for williams wholly owned subsidiaries northwest pipeline  texas gas transmission and transcontinental gas pipe line 
as of march   approximately million of shelf availability remains under these outstanding registration statements and may be used to issue a variety of debt securities 
interest rates  market conditions  and industry conditions will affect amounts raised  if any  in the capital markets 
on march   northwest pipeline corporation  a subsidiary of williams  completed an offering of million of percent senior notes due to certain institutional investors 
the offering is exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of the million of shelf availability mentioned above is not affected by this offering 
williams expects to fund capital and investment expenditures  debt payments and working capital requirements through cash on hand  cash generated from operations  the sale of assets  issuance of debt by certain subsidiaries and or amounts available under williams revolving credit facility 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  williams production rmt company rmt  a wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a million credit agreement rmt note payable dated as of july   with certain lenders including a subsidiary of lehman brothers  inc  a related party to williams 
the rmt note payable is secured by substantially all of the assets of rmt and the capital stock of williams production holdings llc parent of rmt  rmt and certain rmt subsidiaries 
it is also guaranteed by williams  williams production holdings llc holdings and certain rmt subsidiaries 
the assets of rmt are comprised primarily of the assets of the former barrett resources corporation acquired in  which were primarily natural gas properties in the rocky mountain region 
within days of a parent liquidity event  williams must sell rmt 
under the terms of the rmt credit agreements  williams must provide liquidity projections on a weekly basis until the maturity date 
each projection covers a period extending months from the report date 
one of the parent liquidity provisions requires that williams maintain actual and projected liquidity a at any time from the closing date july  through the th day thereafter january   of million  b at any time thereafter through and including the maturity date  of million  and c for liquidity projections provided during the term of the loan  projected liquidity after the maturity date  of million 
the loan matures on july  outlook on february   williams announced that it intended to sell an additional billion over those previously announced in assets  properties and investments 
to realize this level of proceeds  williams announced that it was pursuing the sales of its general partnership interest and limited partner investments in williams energy partners  its  mile texas gas pipeline system and targeted assets in the exploration production and midstream gas liquids segments 
based on the company s forecast of cash flows and liquidity  williams believes that it has the financial resources and liquidity to meet future cash requirements and satisfy current lending covenants through the first quarter of included in this forecast are expected proceeds  net of related debt  totaling nearly billion from the sale of assets 
including periods through first quarter  the company has scheduled debt retirements which includes certain contractual fees and deferred interest associated with an underlying debt of approximately billion 
realization of the proceeds from forecasted assets sales is a significant factor for the company to satisfy its loan covenant which requires minimum levels of parent liquidity and to satisfy current scheduled debt maturities 
credit ratings at december   williams maintained certain preferred interest and debt obligations that contained provisions requiring accelerated payment of the related obligation or liquidation of the related assets in the event of specified declines in williams senior unsecured long term credit ratings assigned by moody s investors service and standard poor s rating agencies 
obligations subject to these ratings triggers totaled million at december  during the first quarter of  williams negotiated changes to certain of the agreements  which eliminated the exposure to the ratings trigger clauses incorporated in the agreements 
negotiations for one of the agreements resulted in williams agreeing to redeem a million preferred interest over the next year in equal quarterly installments see note 
the obligations subject to ratings triggers were reduced to million at march  as a result of the credit rating downgrades to below investment grade in july  williams redeemed million of preferred interests on august  and repaid a million loan in august  thereby eliminating the remaining million exposure 
williams energy risk management and trading business also relied upon the investment grade rating of williams senior unsecured long term debt to satisfy credit support requirements of many counterparties 
as a result of the credit rating downgrades to below investment grade  energy marketing trading s participation in energy risk management and trading activities requires alternate credit support under certain existing agreements 
in addition  williams is required to fund margin requirements pursuant to industry standard derivative agreements with cash  letters of credit or other negotiable instruments 
as a result of williams credit downgrade to non investment grade during  williams is effectively required to post margins of percent or more on forward positions which result in a loss 
any future liquidity requirements related to these instruments will be driven by changes in the value of such instruments as a result of changes in price  volatility  etc 
at december   williams has been assigned the following credit ratings on its senior unsecured long term debt  which are considered to be below investment grade moody s investors service caa negative outlook standard poor s b negative watch off balance sheet financing arrangements and guarantees of debt or other commitments to third parties at december   williams had operating lease agreements with special purpose entities spe s 
the lease agreements relate to certain williams travel center stores included in discontinued operations  offshore oil and gas pipelines and an onshore gas processing plant 
as a result of changes to the agreements in conjunction with the secured financing facilities completed in july  the agreements no longer qualified for operating lease treatment 
the operating leases were recorded as capital leases within long term debt beginning in july  however the travel center lease is reported in liabilities of discontinued operations and was repaid in march pursuant to the travel centers sale 
williams had agreements to sell  on an ongoing basis  certain of its accounts receivable to qualified special purpose entities 
on july   these agreements expired and were not renewed 
williams provides a guarantee of approximately million towards project financing of energy assets owned and operated by discovery producer services llc in which williams owns an interest of percent 
this obligation is not consolidated in williams balance sheet as williams does not maintain a controlling interest in the entity and therefore follows equity accounting for its interest 
performance under the guarantee generally would occur upon a failure of payment by the financed entity or certain events of default related to the guarantor 
these events of default primarily relate to bankruptcy and or insolvency of the guarantor 
at december   there were no events of default by the guarantors or delinquent payments by the financed entity with respect to the project financings 
the guarantee expires at the end of williams has provided guarantees in the event of nonpayment by wcg on certain lease performance obligations of wcg that extend through and have a maximum potential exposure of approximately million

at december   williams had a million receivable original principal amount of million from wcg for the promissory notes relating to the sale of the technology center 
the notes were initially recorded at fair value based on contractual cash flows and an estimated discount rate considering the creditworthiness of wcg  the amount and timing of the cash flows and williams security in the technology center and certain other collateral 
the fourth quarter sale of certain of williams claims against wcg to leucadia resulted in the elimination of billion of receivables  and the associated billion allowance  from williams consolidated balance sheet

the decrease in receivables which provides cash in relates to the decrease in trading activities at energy marketing trading offset by the expiration in of the various sale of receivables programs which served to delay the realization of cash related to receivables 
the decrease in of accrued liabilities is due to lower employee costs and decreased deposits received from customers relating to energy risk management and trading and hedging activities see note 
in march  wcg exercised its option to purchase certain network assets under the adp transaction for which williams provided a guarantee of wcg s obligations

long term debt  including long term debt due within one year at december  was billion compared with billion at december   and billion at december  at december   million of current debt obligations were classified as noncurrent obligations based on williams intent and ability to refinance on a long term basis 
the increase in long term debt is due primarily to the billion related to the feline pacs issuance discussed above  the combined billion issued on march  and the assumption of the billion of wcg note trust notes 
williams long term debt to debt plus equity ratio excluding debt of discontinued operations was percent at december   compared to percent and percent at december  and  respectively

recently issued accounting standards see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 
effects of inflation williams cost increases in recent years have benefited from relatively low inflation rates during that time 
approximately percent of williams gross property  plant and equipment is at gas pipeline and approximately percent is at other operating units 
gas pipeline is subject to regulation  which limits recovery to historical cost 
while amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable under current ferc practices  williams believes it will be allowed to recover and earn a return based on increased actual cost incurred to replace existing assets 
cost based regulation along with competition and other market factors may limit the ability to recover such increased costs 
for the other operating units  operating costs are influenced to a greater extent by specific price changes in oil and gas and related commodities than by changes in general inflation 
crude  refined product  natural gas  natural gas liquids and power prices are particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or the market perceptions concerning the supply and demand balance in the near future 
environmental williams is a participant in certain environmental activities in various stages involving assessment studies  cleanup operations and or remedial processes 
the sites  some of which are not currently owned by williams see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements  are being monitored by williams  other potentially responsible parties  the us environmental protection agency epa  or other governmental authorities in a coordinated effort 
in addition  williams maintains an active monitoring program for its continued remediation and cleanup of certain sites connected with its refined products pipeline activities 
williams is jointly and severally liable along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities and solely responsible in others 
current estimates of the most likely costs of such cleanup activities are approximately million  all of which is accrued at december  williams expects to seek recovery of approximately million of the accrued costs through future natural gas transmission rates 
williams will fund these costs from operations and or available bank credit facilities 
estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed assessment studies  preliminary results of studies or our experience with other similar cleanup operations 
at december   certain assessment studies were still in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield significantly different estimates of most likely costs 
therefore  the actual costs incurred will depend on the final amount  type and extent of contamination discovered at these sites  the final cleanup standards mandated by the epa or other governmental authorities  and other factors 
williams is subject to the federal clean air act and to the federal clean air act amendments of which require the epa to issue new regulations 
williams is also subject to regulation at the state and local level 
in september  the epa promulgated rules designed to mitigate the migration of ground level ozone in certain states 
williams estimates that capital expenditures necessary to install emission control devices over the next five years to comply with rules will be between million and million 
the actual costs incurred will depend on the final implementation plans developed by each state to comply with these regulations 
in december  standards promulgated by the epa for tailpipe emissions and the content of sulfur in gasoline were announced 
williams estimates that capital expenditures necessary to bring its refinery into compliance over the next five years will be approximately million 
the actual costs incurred will depend on the final implementation plans 
in addition to the above mentioned capital expenditures pertaining to the clean air act and amendments  estimated future capital expenditures as of december   for various compliance issues across the company are approximately million 
on july   the epa issued an information request asking for information on oil releases and discharges in any amount from williams pipelines  pipeline systems  and pipeline facilities used in the movement of oil or petroleum products  during the period july  through july  in november  williams furnished its response 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk williams current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to its debt portfolio and its energy risk management and trading portfolio 
williams interest rate risk exposure resulting from its debt portfolio is influenced by short term rates  primarily libor based borrowings from commercial banks and long term us treasury rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  williams targets to maintain a significant portion of its debt portfolio in fixed rate debt 
williams has also utilized interest rate swaps to change the ratio of its fixed and variable rate debt portfolio based on management s assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve and williams ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner 
williams periodically enters into interest rate forward contracts to establish an effective borrowing rate for anticipated long term debt issuances 
the maturity of williams long term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected life of its operating assets 
at december  and  the amount of williams fixed and variable rate debt was at targeted levels 
williams has historically maintained an investment grade credit rating as one aspect of managing its interest rate risk 
however  in july  moody s investors service and standard poor s downgraded their credit ratings of williams long term unsecured debt to below investment grade 
williams also has interest rate risk in long dated energy related contracts included in its energy risk management and trading portfolio 
the value of these transactions can fluctuate daily based on movements in the underlying interest rate curves used to assign value to the transactions 
williams strives to mitigate the associated interest rate risk from the value of these transactions by fixing the underlying interest rate inherent in the energy risk management and trading portfolio 
during  williams began actively managing this exposure as a component of its targeted levels of fixed to floating obligations 
williams uses both floating to fixed interest rate swaps and other derivative transactions to manage this variable rate exposure 
due to williams credit situation at december   only million notional of interest rate swaps were outstanding 
the tables on the following page provide information as of december  and  about williams interest rate risk sensitive instruments 
for notes payable and long term debt the table presents principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the interest rate swaps

the interest rate swaps at december  are reflected at fair value within energy risk management and trading assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as these swaps are entered into to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in the energy risk management and trading portfolio 
notional amounts total approximately billion at december  commodity price risk trading energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported in the midstream gas liquids segment have trading operations that incur commodity price risk as a consequence of providing price risk management services to third party customers 
the most significant exposure to commodity price risk is associated with the natural gas and electricity markets in the united states 
this exposure is primarily within the portfolio of transportation  storage  full requirements  load serving  transmission  and power tolling contracts 
energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported in the midstream gas liquids segment also has commodity price risk exposure to crude oil  refined products  electricity and natural gas in the united states and europe  natural gas liquids markets in the united states and the natural gas markets in canada through other energy contracts such as forward  futures  options  swaps  and purchase and sale contracts 
these energy and energy related contracts are valued at fair value and unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value are recognized in income see note of notes to consolidated financial statements regarding change in accounting principle due to adoption of eitf no 
effective january  
these energy and energy related contracts are subject to risk from changes in energy commodity market prices  volatility and correlation of those commodity prices  the portfolio position of its contracts  the liquidity of the market in which the contract is transacted and changes in interest rates 
energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations actively seek to diversify its portfolio in managing the commodity price risk in the transactions that it executes in various markets and regions by executing offsetting contracts to manage this risk in accordance with parameters established in its trading policy 
a risk control group monitors compliance with the established trading policy and measures the risk associated with the trading portfolio 
energy marketing trading and the natural gas liquids trading operations reported in the midstream gas liquids segment measures the market risk in its trading portfolio utilizing a value at risk methodology to estimate the potential one day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of its trading operations 
at december  and  the value at risk for the trading operations was million and million  respectively 
this decline in value at risk is primarily a result of the percent decline in overall portfolio value outlined in previous sections 
value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that could be incurred from the trading portfolio 
the value at risk model includes all financial instruments and physical positions and commitments in its trading portfolio and assumes that as a result of changes in commodity prices  there is a percent probability that the one day loss in fair value of the trading portfolio will not exceed the value at risk 
the value at risk model uses historical simulations to estimate hypothetical movements in future market prices assuming normal market conditions based upon historical market prices 
value at risk does not consider that changing the energy risk management and trading portfolio in response to market conditions could affect market prices and could take longer to execute than the one day holding period assumed in the value at risk model 
while a one day holding period is the industry standard  a longer holding period could more accurately represent the true market risk in an environment where market illiquidity and credit and liquidity constraints of the company may result in further inability to mitigate risk in a timely manner in response to changes in market conditions 
non trading williams is also exposed to market risks from changes in energy commodity prices within exploration production  petroleum services  the non trading operations of midstream gas liquids and the non trading operations of energy marketing trading 
exploration production has commodity price risk associated with the sales prices of the natural gas and crude oil it produces 
petroleum services refinery is exposed to commodity price risk for crude oil purchases and refined product sales 
midstream gas liquids is exposed to commodity price risk related to natural gas purchases  natural gas liquids purchases and sales  and electricity cost 
energy marketing trading is exposed to changing prices of natural gas purchased for the production of electricity 
williams manages its exposure to certain of these commodity price risks through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
williams non trading derivative commodity instruments primarily consist of natural gas price and basis swaps in its exploration production business 
a value at risk methodology was used to measure the market risk of these derivative commodity instruments in the non trading portfolio 
it estimates the potential one day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of these instruments 
the value at risk model did not consider the underlying commodity positions to which these derivative commodity instruments relate  therefore  it is not representative of actual losses that could occur on a total non trading portfolio basis that includes the underlying commodity positions 
at december   the value at risk for the non trading derivative commodity instruments was approximately million 
value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that could be incurred from the non trading derivative commodity instruments 
the value at risk model assumes that as a result of changes in commodity prices there is a percent probability that the one day loss in fair value of the non trading derivative commodity instruments will not exceed the value at risk 
the value at risk model uses historical simulations to estimate hypothetical movements in future market prices assuming normal market conditions based upon historical market prices 
gains and losses on these derivative commodity instruments would be substantially offset by corresponding gains and losses on the hedged commodity positions 
foreign currency risk williams has international investments that could affect the financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the economic conditions in foreign countries 
international investments accounted for under the cost method totaled million and million at december   and  respectively 
the fair value of these investments is deemed to approximate their carrying amount as the investments are primarily in non publicly traded companies for which it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of these investments 
williams continues to believe that it can realize the carrying value of these investments considering the status of the operations of the companies underlying these investments 
if a percent change occurred in the value of the underlying currencies of these investments against the us dollar  the fair value of these investments at december   could change by approximately million assuming a direct correlation between the currency fluctuation and the value of the investments 
the net assets of foreign operations whose functional currency is the local currency  which are consolidated are located primarily in canada and approximate percent of williams net assets at december  these foreign operations do not have significant transactions or financial instruments denominated in other currencies 
however  these investments do have the potential to impact williams financial position  due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of re measuring the local functional currency into the us dollar 
as an example  a percent change in the respective functional currencies against the us dollar could have changed stockholders equity by approximately million at december  williams historically has not utilized derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge the risk associated with the movement in foreign currencies with the exception of a canadian dollar denominated note receivable see note 
however  williams evaluates currency fluctuations and will consider the use of derivative financial instruments or employment of other investment alternatives if cash flows or investment returns so warrant 
equity price risk equity price risk primarily arises from investments in publicly traded energy related companies 
the investments in the energy related companies are carried at fair value and totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively
