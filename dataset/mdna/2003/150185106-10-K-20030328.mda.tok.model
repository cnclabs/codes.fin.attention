item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the table below presents certain financial data expressed as a percent of net revenues and selective statistical information for the periods indicated 
for the years ended december  in millions net revenues admissions food  merchandise and games accommodations and other net revenues cash operating costs and expenses adjusted ebitda depreciation and amortization other non cash and non recurring costs interest expense provision for taxes net income selective statistical information amusement park attendance in thousands amusement park per capita spending water park attendance in thousands water park per capita spending business overview the partnership generates its revenues primarily from sales of admission to its parks  food  merchandise and games inside its parks  and hotel rooms  food and other attractions outside its parks 
the partnership s principal costs and expenses  which include salaries and wages  advertising  maintenance  operating supplies  utilities and insurance  are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with attendance 
the fixed nature of these costs makes attendance a key factor in the profitability of each park 
results of operations include knott s soak city palm springs and michigan s adventure since their acquisition in late may of key accounting policies buildings  rides and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis over each park s operating season 
expenditures made to maintain such assets in their original operating condition are expensed as incurred  and improvements and upgrades are capitalized 
reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance 
these reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted to assure their adequacy 
revenues on multi day admission tickets are recognized over the estimated number of visits expected for each type of ticket  and are adjusted at the end of each seasonal period 
results of operations net revenues for the year ended december  were million  a increase over the year ended december  this followed a increase in  when revenues rose to million from million in net revenues for reflect a increase in combined attendance across our properties to a record million from million in  a increase in out of park revenues and a slight increase in combined in park guest per capita spending to from in 
the increase in out of park revenues was driven primarily by healthy improvement in occupancy levels at cedar point s resort hotels 
in  successful capital investments at both cedar point and knott s berry farm  along with strong marketing programs and a record year at dorney park  boosted combined attendance at the partnership s six amusement parks by to million guests 
at cedar point  the introduction of the park s th roller coaster and the addition of the new peanuts themed ice show  contributed to the park s strong performance 
the introduction of the xcelerator roller coaster in july and a strong halloween haunt promotion in october led knott s berry farm to a strong second half of the year 
at the five water parks  ideal weather conditions at the midwest properties  along with a full year contribution from knott s soak city palm springs  led to a increase in attendance to million guests 
excluding the impact of the new park  combined water park attendance was still up from a year ago 
in  the contribution of michigan s adventure  along with a very strong year at dorney park  offset attendance declines at the partnership s other four amusement parks resulting from the weak economy and the lack of a major new attraction 
much improved weather  together with the very successful debut of the talon roller coaster  contributed to dorney s strong performance 
combined attendance at the six amusement parks finished at million  up slightly from meanwhile  combined attendance at the partnership s five water parks increased to million guests  in part due to the contribution of the palm springs water park 
combined per capita spending in decreased due to more aggressive promotions being offered during the year at several of the parks  as well as a shift in the mix of attendance toward lower per capita parks  such as the water parks 
cash operating costs and expenses  excluding depreciation and all non cash and non recurring charges  increased only to million from million in and million in  due in part to the mid year addition of michigan s adventure and knott s soak city palm springs in management believes that a very meaningful measure of operating results and the partnership s ability to generate cash flow for distributions to unitholders is adjusted ebitda  which represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and non cash and non recurring charges 
in  adjusted ebitda increased to million compared to million in and million in the consolidated adjusted ebitda margin improved to from in  largely due to attendance increases at the partnership s three largest parks 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of operating performance computed in accordance with gaap and should not be considered a substitute for operating income  net income or cash flows from operating activities 
in addition  adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
other non cash and non recurring costs include several items 
consistent with prior periods  variable priced unit options have been marked to market as they vest over their contractual life 
based on additional vesting of the options and the change in the market price of limited partnership units from year to year  a non cash charge of million was recorded in compared to million in in  under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  the partnership expects to recognize approximately million of unit option expense 
the partnership recorded a provision of million in for the estimated portion of the net book value of certain fixed assets that might not be recoverable after they were removed from service 
in  the partnership recorded million of non recurring costs incurred in eliminating its previous general partner fee and executive compensation systems 
in and  the partnership entered into several interest rate swap agreements as a means of converting a portion of its variable rate debt into fixed rate debt at favorable rates 
under the applicable accounting rules  the partnership recognized a million non cash charge in other expense in related to the change in fair value of two of its swap option agreements that could not be designated as effective hedges 
this amount will reverse into income in and as the swaps continue to serve the purpose of leveling cash interest costs 
after these non cash charges and credits  and interest expense and provision for taxes  both of which were comparable between years  net income for increased to million compared to million in and million in for  the partnership plans to invest approximately million in capital improvements at its properties  including the introduction of top thrill dragster  the world s tallest and fastest roller coaster  at cedar point  and the addition of a double impulse roller coaster  called steel venom  at valleyfair 
the partnership is optimistic that these investments  as well as other improvements at each of the parks  will generate a high level of public interest and acceptance 
however  stable population trends in the parks market areas and uncontrollable factors  such as weather  the economy  and competition for leisure time and spending  preclude management from anticipating significant long term increases in attendance at the parks 
historically  cedar fair has been able to improve its revenues and profitability by continuing to make substantial investments in its parks and resort facilities 
this has enabled the partnership to maintain consistently high attendance levels  as wel l as increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodations  while carefully controlling operating and administrative expenses 
in and  however  competitive discounting and soft economic conditions in the partnership s regional market areas led to virtually flat in park guest per capita spending 
partnership financial condition the partnership ended in sound financial condition in terms of both liquidity and cash flow 
the negative working capital ratio of at december  is the result of the partnership s highly seasonal business and careful management of cash flow to reduce borrowings 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities and pre opening expenses as required 
the partnership has no significant off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in  cash generated from operations totaled million and new term loan borrowings provided million 
the partnership used million for capital expenditures  million for distributions to the general and limited partners  and million to pay down revolving credit borrowings 
distributions in  at the current annual rate of per unit  would total approximately million  higher than the distributions paid in at yearend  the partnership had million of fixed rate term debt  as well as a million revolving credit facility  which is available through november borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled million as of december   of which million has been converted to fixed rate obligations for a period of up to two more years by use of interest rate swap agreements 
credit facilities and cash flow from operations are expected to be adequate to meet seasonal working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and regular quarterly cash distributions
