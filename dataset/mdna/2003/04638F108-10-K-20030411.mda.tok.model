table of contents the company s statements of cash flows for the three years ending january   and are included on page net cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal year and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in net cash flow from operations in fiscal is attributed primarily to the lower accounts receivable and inventory balances and the timing of payments to vendors

the company s cash collection cycle decreased to days sales outstanding from the prior year s days

the purchase and sales agreement contains a clause which will require the company to pay additional purchase price of up to  if certain sales levels are achieved 
the earnout provision is effective over a period of months 
at january   no additional consideration was owed to the sellers 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are as follows revenue recognition the majority of the company s product sales are recorded at the time of shipment and when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
provisions are made at the time the related revenue is recognized for the cost of any installation obligations 
when other significant obligations remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled 
warranty claims and bad debts provisions for the estimated costs for future product warranty claims and bad debts are recorded in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expense  respectively  at the time a sale is recorded 
the amounts recorded are generally based upon historically derived percentages while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis such as new product introduction for warranty and bankruptcies of particular customers for bad debts 
the company also periodically evaluates the adequacy of its reserves for warranty and bad debts recorded in its consolidated balance sheet as a further test to ensure the adequacy of the recorded provisions 
warranty claims can extend far into the future and bad debt analysis often involves subjective analysis of a particular customer s ability to pay 
as a result  significant judgment is required by the company in determining the appropriate amounts to record and such judgments may prove to be incorrect in the future 
the company believes that its procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to the actual amounts 

table of contents customer returns customer returns are recorded on an actual basis throughout the year and also include an estimate at the end of each reporting period for future customer returns related to sales recorded prior to the end of the period 
the company generally estimates customer returns based upon its historical experience while making adjustments for any changes in business conditions 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
the company records provisions to write down obsolete and excess inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
the process for evaluating obsolete and excess inventory consists of the company analyzing the inventory supply on hand and estimating the net realizable value of the inventory based on historical experience  current business conditions and anticipated future sales 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this sfas requires that deferred income taxes be determined based on estimated future tax effects of differences between the tax and book bases of assets and liabilities considering the provisions of enacted tax laws 
the company has historically had prepaid income tax assets due principally to the unfavorable tax consequences of recording expenses for required book reserves for such things as  bad debts  inventory valuation  and warranty that cannot be deducted for income tax purposes until such expenses are actually paid 
the company s deferred tax liabilities consist primarily of favorable tax consequences associated with accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes 
sfas no 
requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including the company s performance  the market environment in which the company operates  length of carryforwards periods  existing sales backlog and future sales projections 
we had previously provided valuation allowances only for future tax benefits resulting from certain foreign losses 
however  where there are cumulative losses in recent years  sfas creates a strong presumption that a valuation allowance is needed 
this presumption can be overcome in very limited circumstances 
as a result of our cumulative loss position at january  and the increased uncertainty relative to the timing of profitability in future periods  we concluded that is was appropriate to establish a valuation allowance for our entire net deferred tax asset 
the company established a full valuation allowance for our remaining deferred tax assets 
as a result  the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased from  at january  to million at january  we expect to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until we can sustain an appropriate level of profitability and until such time  we would not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in our future results of operations  except as those benefits are realized on the tax return 
long lived asset and goodwill the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
goodwill impairment reviews are performed in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company performs the goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  unless events or circumstances change
