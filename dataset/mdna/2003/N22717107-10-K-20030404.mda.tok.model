item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general generally  our customers expectations about their capital expenditure programs change in correlation to rig activity and the prices of oil and natural gas 
accordingly  the changes in their capital expenditures will normally result in increased or decreased demand for our products and services 
although commodity prices for both natural gas and crude oil rose throughout  activity levels in the oilfield service sector did not increase commensurately 
rig count did improve in the us markets early in the year  only to stay virtually unchanged from may until the end of the year 
rig count activity outside the us remained relatively constant throughout the year 
rig count oil and gas prices year ended worldwide rig count us rig count crude oil price per barrel natural gas price per mcf production of natural gas in was down compared to the prior year  which contributed to an increase in the price of natural gas during the year 
in addition  the amount of natural gas in storage changed from being at near five year highs at the beginning of the year to significantly below average levels march  oil prices also rose throughout the year due principally to geopolitical reasons 
outside north america  our sales grew during the year to record levels despite the continued depressed activity levels of our clients 
however  due to the lower activity levels in north america  the products and services that we offer into those markets suffered during the year 
we continue our efforts to expand our market presence by opening strategic facilities and realizing synergies within our business lines 
also  as a result of the consolidation in the oil and gas industry  some of our customers have used  and may continue to use  their global presence and market influence to seek economies of scale and pricing concessions 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based on financial statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the us and require management to make estimates and assumptions during their preparation 
the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments revenue recognition  long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill  inventory valuation allowances  income taxes  and estimates 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized as services are completed or as product title is transferred 
all advance client payments are classified as unearned revenues until services are earned or product title is transferred 
we recognize revenue consistent with the guidance set forth in the sec 
table of contents staff accounting bulletin no 
 sab  as amended 
to determine proper revenue recognition  we ensure that we follow these principles i persuasive evidence an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services rendered  iii the fee is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from long term contracts are recorded as services are rendered in proportion to the work performed 
all known or anticipated losses on contracts are provided for currently 
training and consulting service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
sales of perpetual software licenses  net of deferred maintenance fees  are recorded as revenue once the criteria of statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions are successfully met 
we primarily license our software products under perpetual licenses 
customer support agreements are recorded as unearned revenues and recognized as revenue ratably over the contract period  generally one year 
long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill property  plant and equipment are carried at cost 
major renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the respective asset s remaining useful life 
maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred 
when assets are sold or retired  the remaining costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income 
property  plant and equipment held and used by us is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
indicators of possible impairment include extended periods of idle use and or an inability to contract specific assets or groups of assets 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued two statements  statement of financial accounting standards sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  that amend accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and supersede apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and establishes the purchase method of accounting as the only acceptable method for all business combinations initiated after june  four of our acquisitions in and were accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting and were completed prior to the adoption of sfas goodwill resulting from a business combination from an asset acquisition occurring after june  is to be recognized as an asset but not amortized  while goodwill existing at june  was amortized through december  as a result of adoption of sfas  beginning january   we no longer amortize goodwill but will test for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
any resulting impairment loss could result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations 
upon adoption  in the first quarter of  we recorded an impairment of goodwill of approximately million related to our reservoir management segment which is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the cessation of goodwill amortization under the guidelines resulted in a reduction in operating expenses of approximately million in inventory valuation allowances our valuation reserve for inventory is based on historical data  and various other assumptions and judgments 
should these assumptions and judgments not come to fruition our valuation would change 
the industry we operate in is subject to technological change and new product development that could result in obsolete inventory 
our valuation reserve for inventory at december  was million compared to million at december  if we over or underestimate demand for inventory  it could result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations 
income taxes our income tax expense includes income taxes of the netherlands  us and other foreign countries as well as local  state and provincial income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the asset is recovered or the liability is settled 
any valuation allowance recorded is based on estimates and assumptions of taxable income into the future and a determination is made of the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized 
at december   we had recorded approximately million of valuation allowances related to our net deferred tax assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
table of contents and our effective tax rate may increase which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
for a detailed discussion of our accounting policies see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and base these estimates on our historical experience as well as on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in a given circumstance 
by nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we are making the estimate and if changes in the estimate under different assumptions would have had a material impact on our financial condition 
critical estimates include key estimate nature of estimates required assumptions used allowance for doubtful accounts estimating allowance for doubtful accounts requires that we determine whether customer receivables may not be collectible 
we base our estimate on historical collection activity and our current understanding of the aging of existing amounts outstanding based on our clients representations 
inventory reserves estimating reserves for inventory requires forecasting of obsolescence  inventory excess and customer demand as well as taking into account changes in technological advances we base our estimate on historical excess and obsolescence  as well as our expectations of customer commitments 
depreciation and amortization estimating depreciation and amortization requires us to estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
lives assigned reflect our best estimate based on historical data of the respective asset s useful life and salvage value 
if our operating plans change it could result in impairment of these assets 

table of contents key estimate nature of estimates required assumptions used income taxes we estimate the likelihood of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset in particular  net operating loss carryforwards we use historical and projected future operating results  including a review of the eligible carryforward period  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
if the laws of some of our tax jurisdictions change it could significantly alter our estimates 
long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill we periodically review the recoverability of our assets  particularly when changes in circumstances suggest that the recorded cost may not be recoverable 
the measure of possible impairment is based primarily on the ability to recover the balance of the related asset from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis we estimate cash flows using internal budgets based on historical information as well as customer commitments and expected market trends 
our impairment analysis is subjective and assumptions regarding future growth rates and operating expenses could have a significant effect on expected future cash flows and our ultimate impairment analysis 
off balance sheet arrangements we hold investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries whose operations are in line with those of our core businesses 
our investment and operating percentages in these entities are included in our consolidated financial statements 
these entities are not considered special purpose entities nor do we have special off balance sheet arrangements through these entities 
they are not consolidated due to the limited influence we have in making management decisions 
we do not expect our investments to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
business core laboratories was established in and is currently traded on the new york stock exchange 
we provide our products and services to the world s major  national and independent oil companies 
our specialty services and products are designed to improve oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields through the following business segments reservoir description encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock  fluid and gas samples 
we provide analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and petroleum products to the oil and gas industry 
production enhancement includes products and services relating to reservoir well completions  perforations  stimulations and production 
we provide integrated services to evaluate the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects 
reservoir management combines and integrates information from reservoir description and production enhancement services to increase production and improve recovery of oil and gas from our clients reservoirs 
we plan to continue the expansion of our operations through i continuing the development of proprietary technologies through client driven research and development  ii expanding the services and products offered throughout our global network of offices and iii acquiring complementary businesses that add key technologies or market presence and enhance existing products and services 

table of contents results of operations service revenues and cost of services dollars in millions bar graph the discussion of operating results at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of operating results by segment 
our revenues are derived from services and product sales 
services revenues in were million as compared to million in while oilfield activity levels in north america were weak  this was offset by sales of our services outside of the north american markets as well as the million of revenue attributable to the acquisition of ads 
in  strong demand for our services led to revenue growth of million as compared to these increases were primarily derived from an increase in oilfield activity in the first half of in north america for our production enhancement projects 
costs of services in were million  an increase of million from costs of services in were  an increase of million from costs of services expressed as a percentage of service revenue were  and in   and  respectively 
the increase in the costs of services percentage was primarily due to the completion of international projects with lower margins coupled with a decrease in higher margin projects in the north american production enhancement business 
costs of services for venezuela remained steady while revenues declined drastically due to the business disruptions experienced in these countries 
sales revenues and cost of sales dollars in millions bar graph decreased sales demand for two consecutive years led to a decline in sales revenue in and sales revenue in decreased by to million compared to million in and decreased by in as compared to significantly lower demand for our products was spurred by the deep decline in drilling for natural gas in the north american markets 
costs of sales in were million  a decrease of million as compared to costs of sales in decreased million from million in costs of sales expressed as a percentage of sales revenues were in  in and in a contributing factor to the decline in margins in was the currency devaluation in venezuela million

depreciation and amortization expense for was million  an increase of million as compared to in we had an increase of million compared to these increases were due primarily to the additional capital investments that occurred in both and as a result of the adoption of sfas beginning january   we no longer amortize goodwill but will test for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
under these requirements  in the first quarter of we reflected impairment of goodwill of approximately million related to our reservoir management segment 
this impairment is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the cessation of goodwill amortization under the guidelines resulted in a reduction in operating expenses of approximately million in during the fourth quarter of  we recorded write offs and other charges of million 
these charges were comprised of inventory write downs of million  charges of million to write fixed assets down to their fair value  and other costs of million to migrate data from legacy computer systems to a global information system database 
during the fourth quarter of we also had several transactions that impacted certain operations that were not viewed as ongoing 
we restructured certain operations in mexico  the united kingdom  the us and other countries to improve operating efficiencies 
this restructuring expense included write offs of assets and leasehold improvements  and an accrual for facility restoration  severance benefits for approximately field employees and lease termination costs 
the remaining accruals for facility restoration should be utilized in and the lease obligations will be utilized by may during we relocated a facility from mexico city  mexico to villahermosa  mexico 
we intend to complete the relocation of one of our operations from dallas to the houston advanced technology center in early this charge of approximately million affected each of our operating segments as follows reservoir description million  production enhancement million  reservoir management million 
substantially all employee terminations were completed by the end of the first quarter of total cash required for this restructuring charge of million will be funded from operating activities 
cash required for the costs incurred through december  was million 
this charge is summarized in the following table restructuring charges lease asset dollars in thousands obligations severance restoration write offs other total total restructuring charges less costs incurred through december  accrual remaining at december  less costs incurred through december  accrual remaining at december  the fixed assets and leasehold improvements were disposed of by the end of december the write off approximates the carrying amount as these assets were abandoned or sold for salvage value 
depreciation expense was reduced by approximately in  in and thereafter 
the asset write offs of were attributable to the reservoir management segment 
other expense in was million compared to other income of million in and million in the change from to consists primarily of additional foreign currency losses of million 
the change from to was the result of a reduced gain on sale of assets and additional foreign currency losses 

table of contents interest expense for was million  a decrease of approximately million as compared to interest expense decreased by million in as compared to the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to lower borrowing costs and lower levels of debt 
the effective income tax rate increased to of operating income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle from the rate of 
this increase was the result of an increase in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes and an increased valuation allowance on venezuela deferred tax assets 
the decrease from in to in reflects the relative increase in international earnings taxed at rates lower than the netherlands statutory rate 
for a reconciliation of the statutory rate of to the effective rate  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
segment analysis our operations are managed primarily in three complementary segments reservoir description  production enhancement and reservoir management

revenues for were bar graph 
table of contents million  an increase of compared to revenues 
during we introduced technology in our gulf of mexico operations in the form of well site and laboratory analysis of unconsolidated core from deepwater reservoirs 
improved market conditions in the middle east and asia pacific also contributed to the increase in revenue 
operating income before interest  taxes and unusual charges in decreased million as compared to reduced activity levels by our clients in north america were the primary factor for our lower earnings in other contributing factors to the decrease were political instability in venezuela and currency devaluation

due to lower industry activity levels  we continued to experience decreased demand for our well completion and stimulation technologies  primarily in our north american markets 
the introduction of two new services  packscan and completion profiler  contributed to the increase in revenue of in compared to in addition  we increased canadian market penetration with proprietary perforating charges and gun systems with our asset purchase of tesco corporation s gris gun 
bar graph operating income before interest  taxes and unusual charges in decreased by as compared to sales of lower margin services and the general decline in the north american markets impacted earnings in this segment 
in  our earnings remained constant compared to in  in an effort to improve manufacturing efficiencies  we recorded expense in cost of sales of approximately million for several initiatives 
these initiatives were implemented in the fourth quarter whereby certain processes and business practices were evaluated and improvements were made 
these costs were offset by income increases due to new initiatives with our downhole completion technologies and incremental margins on fracture diagnostic and field flood monitoring services as the introduction of new services and products in our production enhancement segment increased 
reservoir management reservoir management revenues for were million  a decrease of compared to revenues 
as part of our refocus effort for this group which we announced at the beginning of the year  we elected to transition from lower margins jobs to more integrated higher margin projects  consequently  revenues decreased 
the new projects include higher content of our proprietary services and engineering capabilities for providing field and basin wide production optimization solutions 
bar graph despite our continued efforts to refocus our business strategy in this segment  we recognized a loss of million in operating income before interest  taxes and unusual charges 
in  although we experienced a loss  our margins improved compared to 
table of contents we recorded a restructuring charge of million during to reflect our costs to restructure and refocus this segment of our business 
beginning in certain facilities were downsized or closed  causing our workforce in this segment to be reduced by from the highest levels in we have taken and will continue to take actions  including  but not limited to  employee terminations and facility consolidations  when appropriate  to control our costs and generate additional service revenues in order to improve our results in this segment 
liquidity and capital resources general we have historically financed our activities through cash on hand  cash flows from operations  bank credit facilities  equity financing and the issuance of debt 
cash from operating activities in  million in cash was provided by operating activities compared with million in the change from was primarily a result of non cash charges  including a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million due to the impairment of goodwill related to our reservoir management segment  as well as an increase in depreciation and amortization of million from prior years as a result of depreciation on additional capital investments made in both and provision for doubtful accounts increased by million as we recorded a provision based on our historical experience with accounts receivable collection due to current market conditions 
inventory decreased by million as part of management s efforts to improve inventory turns 
the decrease in inventory was offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  primarily attributed to an increase in prepaid insurance 
accounts payable increased million and other accrued expenses increased million 
for the year ended december  we generated approximately million of cash and cash equivalents from operating activities  principally resulting from our net income of million  as adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization of million and goodwill amortization of million 
other changes that offset the non cash items included a decrease in accounts receivable and accounts payable of million and million  respectively

we may use these shares to finance future acquisitions 
our total borrowings were million  while repayments were approximately million 
our financing activities for included total borrowings of approximately million  while repayments were approximately million 
in  we completed a public offering in which certain shareholders sold  of their common shares 
in connection with the offering  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option and purchased  common shares from us  which resulted in net proceeds of million 
these funds were used principally to reduce indebtedness and fund capital expenditures 
credit facilities and available future liquidity we maintain financial flexibility through our million credit facility of which million was available at december  as of march   approximately million was available under this credit facility 
in addition  we have senior notes  which bear interest at an average interest rate of 
the senior notes require semi annual interest payments  interest payments on the credit facility are made based on the interest period selected 
the terms of the credit facility and senior notes require us to meet certain financial and operational covenants

any such consideration would subsequently result in an adjustment to goodwill 
we expect our capital expenditure program to be approximately million in in addition  we plan to continue our repurchase of shares on the open market through our stock buy back program 
our share repurchase is dependent on market conditions as well as our ability to generate free cash flow 

table of contents our ability to maintain and increase our operating income and cash flow is dependent upon continued capital spending 
we believe our cash on hand  future cash flow from operations  supplemented  if necessary  by our borrowing capacity and issuances of additional equity should be sufficient to meet debt requirements  capital expenditures  working capital and future acquisitions

sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and establishes the purchase method of accounting as the only acceptable method on all business combinations initiated after june  goodwill resulting from a business combination after june  is to be recognized as an asset but not amortized  while goodwill existing at june  was amortized through december  as a result of adoption of sfas  beginning january   we no longer amortize goodwill but will test for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
any resulting impairment loss could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
upon adoption  in the first quarter of we recorded an impairment of goodwill of approximately million related to our reservoir management segment  which is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the cessation of goodwill amortization under the guidelines resulted in a reduction of approximately million in annual operating expenses  assuming no additional impairment of goodwill 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability associated with an asset retirement be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and subsequently depreciated over the life of the asset 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas provides updated guidance for recognition and measurement of an impairment loss for certain types of long lived assets and modifies the accounting and reporting of discontinued operations 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a material adverse effect upon our financial position or results of operations

in november the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements  including guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that upon issuance of certain types of guarantees  a guarantor recognize and account for the fair value of the guarantee as a liability 
fin contains exclusions to this requirement  including the exclusion of a parent s guarantee of its subsidiaries debt to a third party 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin should be applied on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

 consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vies by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries 
a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the enterprise that has the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the vie 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to vies created after january  for vies created at an earlier date  the consolidation requirements apply in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the vie was established 
based on current information  we believe we have no material interests in vies that will require disclosure or consolidation under fin inflation due to the low inflationary rates in  and  the impact of inflation on our results of operations was insignificant 
income taxes as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements at december   we had tax net operating loss carryforwards in various tax jurisdictions of approximately million 
if unused  those carryforwards subject to expiration will expire over the years through although realization is not assured  we anticipate taxable income in future years will allow us to fully utilize the carryforwards that have not had a valuation allowance placed against them 
outlook we have established internal earnings targets that are based on current market conditions 
based on industry surveys  we anticipate north american spending by our clients to increase slightly from levels 
table of contents in response to increasing oilfield activity 
however  we believe that the activity levels outside of north america will remain constant compared to levels 
we expect to meet ongoing working capital and capital expenditure requirements from a combination of cash on hand  cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
we do not enter  or intend to enter  into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not believe that our exposure to market risks  which are primarily related to i interest rate changes and ii fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  although we have experienced losses from time to time are material 
during  we issued fixed rate senior notes denominated in us dollars 
the proceeds were used to pay off variable rate term loans that significantly reduced our exposure to upward interest rate changes 
this section should be read in conjunction with note long term debt and capital lease obligations and note concentration of credit risk of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our credit facility debt  which carries a variable interest rate 
at december   our variable rate debt outstanding of million approximated its fair value 
a one percent change in the interest rate would result in a change of approximately  in interest expense on an annual basis 
we attempt to balance the benefit of variable rate debt that has inherent increased risk with fixed rate debt that has less market risk 
foreign currency risk we operate in a number of international areas which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we do not hold or issue forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
a foreign exchange contract is a foreign currency transaction  defined as an agreement to exchange different currencies at a given date and at a specified rate 
the most significant foreign currency issue in arose in connection with our operations in venezuela 
our venezuelan operation contributed approximately of our revenues 
because of the recent political and financial crisis in venezuela  their currency  the bolivar devalued by approximately during the year ended december we recognized a foreign currency loss of approximately million related to our operations and financial position in this country during credit risk our financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
major banks or investment firms hold cash and cash equivalents such as deposits and temporary cash investments 
our trade receivables are with a variety of domestic  international and national oil and gas companies 
management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the creditworthiness and financial resources of these financial institutions and companies
