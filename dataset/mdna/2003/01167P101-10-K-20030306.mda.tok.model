table of contents introduction this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this form k 
alaska communications systems group acs group was formed in by fox paine company  members of the former senior management team of pacific telecom  inc  and other experienced telecommunications industry executives 
in may  the company acquired centurytel s alaska properties and anchorage telephone utility or atu 
centurytel s alaska properties were the incumbent provider of local telephone services in juneau  fairbanks and more than rural communities in alaska and provided internet services to customers statewide 
centurytel s alaska properties included acs of fairbanks  inc  acs of alaska  inc  and acs of the northland  inc 
atu was the largest lec in alaska and provided local telephone and long distance services primarily in anchorage and wireless services statewide 
atu provided long distance services through atu long distance  inc and wireless services through mactel  inc these companies are now known as acs of anchorage  inc  acs long distance  inc and acs wireless  inc 
on october   the company changed its name from alec holdings  inc to alaska communications systems group  inc on january   the company established acs infosource  inc as a separate operation and transferred to it the company s yellow pages directory advertising business and assets which were previously included as a component of four different local telephone exchange carriers operating in alaska which are also wholly owned subsidiaries of the company 
the consolidated financial statements for acs group represent the operations principally of the following entities alaska communications systems group  inc alaska communications systems holdings  inc acs of alaska  inc acs of the northland  inc acs of fairbanks  inc acs of anchorage  inc acs wireless  inc acs long distance  inc acs television  llc acs internet  inc acs infosource  inc prior to the consummation of the acquisitions of centurytel s alaska properties and atu in may  acs group had no operations 
today  acs group generates revenue primarily through the provision of local telephone services  including basic local service to retail customers within acs group s service areas  wholesale service to clecs  network access services to interexchange carriers for origination and termination of interstate and intrastate long distance phone calls  enhanced services  ancillary services  such as b c  and universal service payments  the provision of wireless services  the provision of yellow pages directory advertising  
table of contents the provision of internet services  and the provision of interexchange network long distance and data services 
acs group also recognizes its proportionate share of the net income or loss of its minority owned investments 
within the telecommunications industry  lecs have historically enjoyed stable revenue and cash flow from local exchange operations resulting from the need for basic telecommunications services  the highly regulated nature of the telecommunications industry and  in the case of rural lecs  the underlying cost recovery settlement and support mechanisms applicable to local exchange operations 
basic local service is generally provided at a flat monthly rate and allows the user to place unlimited calls within a defined local calling area 
access revenues are generated by providing interexchange carriers access to the lec s local network and its customers 
universal service revenues are a subsidy paid to rural lecs to support the high cost of providing service in rural markets 
other service revenue is generated from ancillary services and enhanced services 
changes in revenue are largely attributable to changes in the number of access lines  local service rates and minutes of use 
other factors can also impact revenue  including intrastate and interstate revenue settlement methodologies  authorized rates of return for regulated services  whether an access line is used by a business or residential subscriber  intrastate and interstate calling patterns  customers selection of various local rate plan options  selection of enhanced calling services  such as voice mail other subscriber usage characteristics 
lecs have three basic tiers of customers business and residential customers located in their local service areas that pay for local phone service  interexchange carriers that pay for access to long distance calling customers located within its local service areas and clec s that pay for wholesale access to the company s network in order to provide competitive local service on either a wholesale or une basis as prescribed under the act 
lecs provide access service to numerous interexchange carriers and may also bill and collect long distance charges from interexchange carrier customers on behalf of the interexchange carriers 
the amount of access charge revenue associated with a particular interexchange carrier varies depending upon long distance calling patterns and the relative market share of each long distance carrier 
acs group s local service rates for end users are authorized by the rca 
authorized rates are set by the fcc and the rca for interstate and intrastate access charges  respectively  and may change from time to time 
critical accounting policies and accounting estimates management is responsible for the financial statements presented elsewhere in this k and has evaluated the accounting policies used in their preparation 
management believes these policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this k 
the following discussion identifies those accounting policies that management believes are critical in the preparation of the company s financial statements  the 
table of contents judgements and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  and the possibility that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting the financial statements are those related to the realizable value of accounts receivable  long lived assets  income taxes and network access revenue reserves 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
access revenue is recognized when earned 
the company participates in toll revenue pools with other telephone companies 
such pools are funded by toll revenue and or access charges regulated by the rca within the intrastate jurisdiction and the fcc within the interstate jurisdiction 
much of the interstate access revenue is initially recorded based on estimates 
these estimates are derived from interim financial statements  available separations studies and the most recent information available about achieved rates of return 
these estimates are subject to adjustment in future accounting periods as additional operational information becomes available 
to the extent that disputes arise over revenue settlements  the company s policy is to defer revenue collected until settlement methodologies are resolved and finalized 
at december   the company had recorded liabilities of million related to its estimate of refundable access revenue 
actual results could vary from this estimate 
the company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred taxes reflect the temporary differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if the company thought it was more likely than not that all of its deferred tax assets would be realized in future periods  the company s previously reported net losses for the three years ended december  would decrease by up to million and its accumulated deficit would decrease from million to million 
the local telephone exchange operations of the company account for costs in accordance with the accounting principles for regulated enterprises prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this accounting recognizes the economic effects of rate regulation by recording cost and a return on investment as such amounts are recovered through rates authorized by regulatory authorities 
accordingly  under sfas no 
 plant and equipment is depreciated over lives approved by regulators and certain costs and obligations are deferred based upon approvals received from regulators to permit recovery of such amounts in future years 
historically  lives approved for regulatory purposes have approximated economically useful lives 
on july   the company received an order from the rca which appears to extend lives approved for rate making purposes beyond the economically useful lives of the underlying assets 
management petitioned for reconsideration  and the rca has agreed to take additional testimony 
a final order on the matter is not expected until the second quarter of as of december  the company has deferred as a regulatory asset million of costs incurred in connection with regulatory rate making proceedings  which will be amortized in future periods 
if the company were not following sfas no 
 these costs would have been charged to expense as incurred 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with the guidelines of this accounting principle  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but will be assessed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level upon adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a two step methodology 
the initial step requires the company to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss would be recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit 
table of contents for purposes of this test primarily by using a discounted cash flow valuation technique 
significant estimates used in the valuation include estimates of future cash flows  both future short term and long term growth rates  and estimated cost of capital for purposes of arriving at a discount factor 
at december   the company had recorded goodwill of million and had recorded a transitional impairment loss of million and an impairment loss of million based on the annual impairment test

the revenue increase from approximately million of rate increases for both retail and une local service rates implemented during the fourth quarter of at acsa  as discussed below  was substantially offset by loss of retail market share to competition exacerbated by below cost une rates coupled with the company s promotion of discounted term contracts designed to defend market share 
the company believes it is earning less than its required rate of return for local network service in several of its markets and filed local service rate cases for all of its lec businesses with the rca on july  aimed at making up this deficiency 
subsequently  in october  the company filed for interim and refundable local service rates in its anchorage market in order to expedite a partial recovery of the total revenue deficiency

generally  when the company loses a retail local network service line to a competitor  it continues to provide the line to the competitor on a wholesale basis at reduced revenue per line 
management believes that the continuing loss of market share it has experienced in certain of its markets is partially attributable to below cost interconnection rates mandated by the rca for unes 
during the second quarter of  the company reopened interconnection proceedings for its anchorage market and filed for an interim and refundable une rate increase of approximately per month per loop

in addition  as a result of the rca s recent affirmation of the apuc s termination of the company s rural exemptions  the company may be required to provide interconnection elements and or wholesale discounted services to competitors in all or some of its rural service areas 
moreover  while wireless telephone services have historically complemented traditional lec services  the company anticipates that existing and emerging wireless technologies may increasingly compete with lec services 
in wireless services  the company currently competes with at least one other wireless provider in each of its wireless service areas 
the company competes for directory advertising services with at least one other publisher in substantially all of its service areas 
in the highly competitive business for internet access services  the company currently competes with a number of established online service companies  interexchange carriers and cable companies 
in the interexchange market  the company believes it currently has less than of total revenue in alaska and faces competition from the two major interexchange providers 
the telecommunications industry is subject to continuous technological change 
the company expects that new technological developments in the future will generally serve to enhance its ability to provide service to its customers 
however  these developments may also increase competition or require the company to make significant capital investments to maintain its leadership position in alaska
