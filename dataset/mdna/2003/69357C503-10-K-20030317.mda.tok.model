item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview prg schultz international  inc and subsidiaries the company is the leading provider of recovery audit services to large and mid size businesses having numerous payment transactions with many vendors 
in businesses with large purchase volumes and continuously fluctuating prices  some small percentage of erroneous overpayments to vendors is inevitable 
although these businesses process the vast majority of payment transactions correctly  a small number of errors do occur 
in the aggregate  these transaction errors can represent meaningful lost profits that can be particularly significant for businesses with relatively narrow profit margins 
the company s trained  experienced industry specialists use sophisticated proprietary technology and advanced recovery techniques and methodologies to identify overpayments to vendors 
in addition  these specialists review clients current practices and processes related to procurement and other expenses in order to identify solutions to manage and reduce expense levels  as well as apply knowledge and expertise of industry best practices to assist clients in improving their business efficiencies 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition and accounts receivable reserves  goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
however  certain of the company s accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of its financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on the invoice basis except with respect to its meridian vat reclaim meridian and channel revenue units where revenue is recognized on the cash basis in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
clients are invoiced for a contractually specified percentage of amounts recovered when it has been determined that they have received economic value generally through credits taken against existing accounts payable due to the involved vendors or refund checks received from those vendors  and when the following criteria are met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b services have been rendered  c the fee billed to the client is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
the determination that each of the aforementioned criteria are met requires the application of significant judgment by management and a misapplication of this judgment could result in inappropriate recognition of revenue 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of its clients to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s clients were to deteriorate  or their operating climate were to change  resulting in an impairment of either their ability or willingness 
table of contents to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if the company s estimate of required allowances for doubtful accounts is determined to be insufficient  it could result in decreased operating income in the period such determination is made 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of december   the company had unamortized goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million 
effective january   the company implemented statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead  such assets must be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
this statement also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company and its independent valuation advisors completed all required transitional testing related to the adoption of sfas no 
in the second quarter of based upon this testing  the company concluded that all net goodwill balances relating to its communications services and channel revenue reporting units  which are part of the company s other ancillary services segment  were impaired 
as a result  the company recognized a before tax charge of million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change  retroactive to january  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million as a reduction to this goodwill impairment charge  resulting in an after tax charge of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company  working with independent valuation advisors  completed the required annual impairment testing and concluded that there was not an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as of october  as of december   the company had a consolidated goodwill asset of million  consisting of million relating to the accounts payable services segment and million relating to the other ancillary services segment  and other intangible assets of million relating to the accounts payable services segment 
to the extent that management or its independent valuation advisers misjudges or miscalculates any of the critical factors necessary to determine whether or not there is a goodwill or other intangible assets impairment  or if any of our goodwill or other intangible assets are accurately determined to be impaired  our future earnings could be materially adversely impacted 
income taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency market risk 
our functional currency is the us dollar although we transact business in various foreign locations and currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we provide services 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we operate 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  the value of nonfunctional currency revenues decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the functional currency amount of revenues increases 
overall  we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefit from a weaker dollar 
we are therefore adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
interest rate risk 
our interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our debt 
at december  and  we had fixed rate convertible notes outstanding with a principal amount of million which bear interest at per annum 
at december   we had approximately million long term variable rate debt outstanding 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates on variable rate debt during the twelve months ended december  would have resulted in approximately a million change in pre tax income
