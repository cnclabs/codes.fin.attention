item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we are an experienced partner for broadband service providers  but are primarily focused on cable operators 
our mission is to deliver innovative broadband data  video and voice solutions for the deployment of revenue generating services today and tomorrow 
we sell our products to cable operators and other providers of broadband services through direct sales forces in north america  europe and asia 
we also distribute our products through resellers and system integrators 
we are structured around and our sales are derived from the following operating segments cable broadband access systems cable and telecom carrier systems telecom 
the products sold in cable consist of docsis standards based products  our proprietary s cdma products  our cherrypicker digital video management system and the multigate telephony and data access system  which are sold primarily to cable operators for the deployment of data  video and voice services over the existing cable infrastructure 
the products sold in telecom consist of our miniplex dsl multiplexer system  the iptl dslam  mainsail mmap and mainsail iad  which are sold to broadband service providers for the deployment of voice and data services over the existing copper wire infrastructure 
during fiscal  of our total revenues were derived from cable and from telecom 
our customers  which primarily consist of us and international cable operators  are currently moving towards products which are standards based or  in other words  based on a set of generally accepted industry standards 
we have been challenged to develop a new line of products that incorporate the docsis standard technologies and to establish ourselves through this our new product line as a supplier to the docsis market 
revenues from proprietary s cdma systems are declining as we are in a transitional period of launching our docsis based systems 
as a supplier of standards based products  we face a more competitive market 
these standards are shared  at no cost  with us and our competitors  which means that it will be increasingly difficult for us to differentiate our products to compete with other companies who are producing similar products 
consequently  we will need to find other ways ie price  quality  level of service to differentiate ourselves from our competitors 
in the current marketplace  we have been affected by the move to standards based products through increased competition  which has driven down average selling prices asps sharply 
these asp decreases  without a corresponding decrease in the cost of goods sold  could cause us to not be successful in transitioning to a standards based technology 
the evolution of broadband has resulted in cable television operators  providers of telephone service and other service providers seeking to provide a bundle of voice  data and video services to their residential and commercial subscribers over existing and new infrastructures 
recognizing this trend  from september through december  we acquired ten companies in the following chronological order imedia  radwiz  telegate  ane  combox  certain assets of internet telecom  ultracom  digitrans  mainsail and truechat 

table of contents the intended result of these acquisitions was to offer customers and potential customers a robust family of product offerings that integrated many of the acquired technologies 
additionally  we sought to expand our portfolio of broadband products to support high speed delivery of voice  data and video services over cable  dsl and wireless 
in order to achieve the expected integration of the products and realize the synergies of combined infrastructures  the technologies needed to be further developed  and the products needed to obtain market acceptance 
given market conditions at the time of the acquisitions  we paid high values to acquire these technologies 
although we were successful incorporating a number of these technologies into our products  significant downturns in the broadband services and telecommunication markets and our decision to suspend certain product lines and product development efforts  caused us to reassess the goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions for recoverability 
for more information relating to the acquisitions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the general economic slowdown  and the technology sector slowdown in particular  had a significant impact on our operating results 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we had experienced significant quarter over quarter growth 
however  during the first quarter of  we recognized that significantly more than company specific issues were occurring and that the general economic conditions in our industry were likely to permanently impact our ability to recover the carrying amount of intangible assets from the acquisitions on our balance sheet 
due to these economic conditions  none of the products from our acquired businesses have achieved the level of market acceptance that was forecasted at the time of their acquisitions 
additionally  certain product groups have not achieved the level of technological development needed to be marketable or to expand the market 
early in the second quarter of and again in the first and second quarter of  we reviewed impairment indicators  which were present for our acquisitions 
the overall impairment indicator was the decrease in demand for our products 
since the long lived assets were not projected to generate sufficient undiscounted cash flows to recover their value over the remaining lives of the assets  our asset impairment policy directed that the value of the assets be written down to fair value 
in the case of assets for which the expected future cash flows were negative  all intangibles were written off million in and million in 
no intangible assets remained at december  during  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan to streamline our worldwide organizational structure 
additionally  in the third quarter of fiscal  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan to scale back our business due to the significant decline in revenues in the second and third quarters of these restructuring programs included a worldwide workforce reduction throughout all departments within the company and consolidation of excess facilities 
as a consequence of our restructuring plan  we expect to continue to invest in research and development  primarily in our cable segment  at slightly reduced levels in the future 
we currently expect sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses to continue to decrease in as a result of the restructuring 
for additional information regarding the restructuring program  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on march   we initiated a worldwide reduction in force of approximately employees  or percent of the workforce  and the closure of certain remote facilities 
we expect to record total charges in the range of approximately million to million associated with the realignment and the write down of certain related assets in the quarter ending march  we had a net loss of million  million and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
we had an accumulated deficit of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a significant portion of the loss in was due to the write off of intangible assets and restructuring charges  but was partially offset by gains resulting from our buy back of a majority of our convertible debt 
our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations of future sales  and we expect that a significant portion of our expenses will be committed in advance of sales 
we anticipate that we will spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures during the year ending december  anticipated capital expenditures consist of purchases of computer hardware  furniture and leasehold improvements for our facilities  and software and equipment 
we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 

table of contents critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  bad debt reserves  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  warranty returns  restructuring  accounting for share based compensation and contingencies to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
we discuss each of our critical accounting policies  in addition to certain less significant accounting policies  with senior members of management and the audit committee  as appropriate 
use of estimates 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these policies include revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  which impacts revenue  the valuation of exposures associated with the contract manufacturing operations and estimating future warranty costs  which impact cost of goods sold and gross margins  and the valuation of certain long lived assets  especially goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  which has resulted in impairment  which impacts operating expenses 
we have other equally important accounting policies and practices which may not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria is based on management s judgments regarding the collectibility of the selling price 
should there be changes to management s judgments  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
bad debt reserves 
we evaluate our trade receivables based upon a combination of factors 
when we become aware of a customer s inability to pay  such as in the case of bankruptcy or a decline in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to an amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also record reserves for bad debt for customers based upon other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
if circumstances related to a specific customer change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further reduced 
inventory valuation 
our policy for valuation of inventory and commitments to purchase inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  generally six months or less  as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for the revenue forecast  which is also consistent with our short term manufacturing plan 
based on this analysis  we reduce the cost of inventory that it specifically identified and considered obsolete or excessive to fulfill future sales estimates 
we define obsolete inventory as inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is 
table of contents determined using our best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available 
we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories in the normal course of business 
we have increased our reserves significantly in recent periods due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines as well as fluctuations in market conditions due to changes in demand for our product 
we generally purchase our inventory through purchase orders with fixed pricing and do not have supply agreements with our vendors  which provide pricing or volume discounts 
if future demand is less favorable than projected  and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  additional inventory reserves may be required which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
impairment of long lived assets 
our long lived assets have included long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our estimate of the fair value of the long term investments was dependent on the performance of the companies in which we have invested  as well as the volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
if the companies business forecasts were not met  we had to record additional impairment charges 
during the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of impairment losses related to our long term investments as other income expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
on january  we reclassified million of assembled workforce  net of accumulated amortization  with an indefinite life  to goodwill at the date of adoption of this standard 
we test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we completed the initial goodwill impairment review as of the beginning of  and found no impairment 
during the first and second quarters of  we completed a restructuring and impairment review as further discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
due to a difficult economic environment and heightened price competition in the modem and telecom businesses during the second quarter of  we experienced a significant drop in our market capitalization and therefore proceeded to perform an interim test to measure goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
the outcome of this test resulted in a non cash charge of million to write off goodwill in both the cable and telecom segments during the second quarter of at december   we had no other intangible assets recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
the following pro forma information reflects the impact on net income loss and net income loss per share assuming the adoption of sfas no 
had occurred on january  in thousands twelve months ended pro forma pro forma reported net loss amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives pro forma net loss basic and diluted net loss per share reported net loss adjustment related to amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives pro forma net loss per share warranty reserves 
we provide a standard warranty for most of our products  generally lasting one to five years from the date of purchase 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and our expectation of future conditions 
should actual product 
table of contents failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision to the warranty liability would be required  resulting in decreased gross profits 
restructuring and other related charges 
during and  we implemented restructuring programs to focus and streamline our business and reduce operating expenses 
in connection with these programs  we reduced headcount and abandoned facilities 
as a result of these actions  we recorded restructuring and other related charges consisting of cash severance payments to be made to severed employees  lease payments related to property abandoned as a result of our facilities consolidation  and legal and other costs 
each reporting period  we review these estimates based on the status of execution of our restructuring plan and  to the extent that these assumptions change due to changes especially in real estate market conditions  the ultimate restructuring expenses could vary 
as of december   our restructuring actions related to employee severance were nearly complete and we had million remaining related to severance obligations 
the million of cash expenditures related to our restructuring liability as of december   are expected to be paid over the remaining term of our facility lease through deferred compensation 
deferred compensation for options granted to employees has been determined as the difference between the deemed fair market value of our common stock on the date options were granted and the exercise price 
deferred compensation for options granted to non employees has been determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
as the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
deferred compensation for options granted to non employees is remeasured at each reporting period as the underlying options vest 
as of december   we recorded deferred compensation on our balance sheet of  in connection with options granted to a non employee 
this deferred compensation is amortized over the two year vesting period of the related options 
during   and  we amortized million  million  and million of deferred share compensation  respectively  primarily related to option grants to non employees and grants of restricted stock to employees 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  acquisition and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters  resulting in higher net loss 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december  annual change in thousands product revenues cable revenues telecom revenues total revenues we sell our products directly to broadband service providers  and to a lesser extent  resellers and system integrators 
revenues related to product sales are recognized when persuasive evidence an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a provision is made for estimated product returns as product 
table of contents shipments are made 
our existing agreements typically do not grant return rights beyond those provided by the warranty 
revenues consist primarily of sales of products to new and existing customers providing broadband services 
our revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in revenues in north america  which includes the united states and canada decreased to million in  down from million in revenues from international locations decreased to million in down from million in one customer  cross beam networks  a subsidiary of sumitomo  accounted for more than of our total revenues for the year ended december  decrease in revenues  year over year and decrease in north american revenues were primarily due to the slowdown in the general economy  over capacity of broadband products especially in north america  and constraints on technology related capital spending  in particular cable service providers 
cable broadband access systems cable revenue 
revenues from cable were million for the year ended december   down from million in due to lower shipments of modems and head ends in than in  as well as a continued decline in average selling prices asps year over year as ongoing competitive pricing pressures affected revenue performance in several of our cable products 
telecom carrier access systems telecom revenue 
revenues from telecom were million  down from million in we have a small customer base  and revenues were impacted by significant declines in telecom industry spending 
additionally  we continue to decrease focus on our telecom segment and apply our resources to our cable segment 
during  the cable industry moved to purchasing more standards based docsis products as opposed to our proprietary modems and head ends  and we faced increasingly strong competition from multiple vendors  which unfavorably impacted revenues 
further  during and  we were unfavorably impacted by declines in average selling prices asps of our modems 
in addition  revenues from our telecom segment were impacted by declines in telecom industry spending 
the intensely competitive nature of the market for broadband products resulted in significant price erosion in we have experienced and expect to continue to experience downward pressure on our unit asps 
a key component of our strategy is to decrease the cost of manufacturing our products to offset the declines in asp 
we intend to continue to implement cost reduction efforts  including design changes and manufacturing efficiencies 
for the year ended december  annual change in thousands related party revenues rogers revenues harmonic revenues shaw revenue total revenues related party revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in related party revenues in include revenues from rogers communications  inc rogers and harmonic  inc harmonic 
alek krstajic  a member of our board of directors  was the senior vice president of interactive services  sales and product development for rogers until january effective in may  rogers will no longer be a related party to us 
lewis solomon  another member of our board of directors  is a member of the board of directors of harmonic 
the decline in related party revenues is primarily due to the same economic and competitive pressures discussed above 
in addition  shaw communications  inc shaw was a related party during the first three quarters of in the fourth quarter of  shaw was no longer determined to be a related party as they no longer exercised voting rights over their shares of our stock  and a board member that was an employee of shaw resigned from our board of directors 
accordingly  revenues from shaw were no longer included in related party revenues beginning in the fourth 
table of contents quarter of see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
none of our related parties is a supplier to us 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  annual change in thousands cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists of direct product costs as well as the cost of our manufacturing operations 
the cost of the manufacturing includes contract manufacturing  test and quality assurance for products  warranty costs and associated costs of personnel and equipment 
in  cost of goods sold decreased to million or of revenues from million or of revenues in cost of goods sold in included a reversal of approximately million in special charges taken in for vendor cancellation charges and inventory previously reserved for obsolescence 
we reversed this provision as we were able to sell inventory originally considered to be in excess 
in addition  we were able to negotiate downward certain vendor cancellation claims to terms more favorable to us 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  included special charges of million and approximately million of amortization of acquired intangible assets 
additionally  during  we recorded an inventory charge of million to reduce some of our inventory to the lower of its cost or market value as asps fell below the cost of these products 
no charge to record a lower of cost or market value was recorded by us in or in accordance with sfas no 
 there was no amortization of acquired intangible assets in gross profit for the year ended december  annual change in thousands gross profit we achieved a gross profit of million or of sales in the year ended december  compared to million or in the increase in our gross profit was primarily related to a million reversal of special charges in  in comparison to million of special charges for vendor cancellation charges and inventory obsolescence reserves incurred in excluding the reversal of special charges  gross profit for the year ended december  was of sales 
excluding special charges and amortization costs  gross profit for the year ended december  was of sales 
this decrease in gross profit excluding special charges and amortization was primarily due to decreases in asps 
additionally  we were not able to decrease our cost of goods sold as quickly as the decrease in asps 
during  we recorded an inventory charge of million to reduce some of our inventory to the lower of its cost or market value as asps fell below the cost of these products 
no charge to record a lower of cost or market value was recorded by us in or during  we anticipate further decreases in our asps and continued pressure on our margins  and we expect to see decreasing margins in unless and until we can produce lower cost products and increase sales of our higher margin head end products 
these asp decreases  without a corresponding decrease in our product costs  will likely have an adverse impact on our operating results through at least 
table of contents operating expenses for the year ended december  annual change in thousands research and development sales and marketing general and administrative goodwill amortization research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  internally designed prototype material expenditures  outside engineering consultants  equipment and supplies required to develop and enhance our products 
research and development expenses decreased to million or of sales in the year ended december  from million or of sales in the decrease of million is attributable to a million decline in spending in our cable segment  an million decline in spending in our telecom segment  and a million reduction in amortization of intangible assets 
research and development expenses in the cable segment decreased primarily due to reductions in employee related expenses and outside engineering consultants 
discontinuing the development of our digitrans product line contributed million of the cable segment expense reduction 
additionally  we have reduced research and development efforts in our telecom segment by million due to market conditions in the telecom sector 
in  we recorded amortization of acquired intangible assets of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 there was no amortization in we believe it is critical to continue to make significant investments in research and development to create innovative technologies and products that meet the current and future requirements of our customers 
accordingly  we intend to continue our investment in research and development primarily in our cable segment related to docsis standards based products 
in connection with our worldwide restructuring plan announced on march   we currently expect research and development to decrease in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for sales personnel  marketing and support personnel  and costs related to trade shows  consulting and travel 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by million to million or of sales in the year ended december  from million or of sales in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to million in decreased headcount from the restructuring and other expenses in our telecom segment  and million in decreased spending for promotional activities in our cable segment 
the decreased spending for promotional activities in the cable segment  includes a million decrease in employee salaries and related costs  a million decrease in co marketing activities  a million decrease for advertising  a million decrease for field trials  a million decrease for tradeshows  a million decrease for public relations and other consulting services  and a million decrease in promotional literature 
these spending decreases were partially offset by million of additional expenses in related to an aircraft lease obtained in early additionally  in  we recorded amortization of acquired intangible assets of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 there was no amortization in in connection with our worldwide restructuring plan announced on march   we currently expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to decrease in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits for administrative officers and support personnel  travel expenses and legal  accounting and consulting fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million or of sales in the year ended december  from million or of sales in the decrease is primarily due to lower headcount from the restructuring and reduced legal and information technology expenditures in additionally  in  general and administrative expenses included million of amortization of acquired intangible assets

table of contents goodwill amortization 
the amortization of goodwill arising from acquisitions completed during and was million for the year ended december  upon adoption of sfas no 
 effective january   we were no longer required to amortize the goodwill of assets associated with our acquisitions in and consequently  we recorded no amortization in restructuring costs and asset write offs for the year ended december  in thousands restructuring charges long lived assets written off intangible assets written off restructuring costs and asset write offs restructuring costs in the third quarter of  we initiated a restructuring program to conform our expense and revenue levels and to better position us for future growth and eventual profitability 
as part of this program  we restructured our worldwide operations including a worldwide reduction in workforce and the consolidation of excess facilities 
we incurred additional restructuring charges of million in of the total restructuring charge  million is related to employee termination costs 
the remaining million relates primarily to costs for excess leased facilities 
during  the employment of employees was terminated and we made cash payments of million against the restructuring accrual 
additionally  in  we reclassed million from employee termination costs to excess lease facility costs 
we anticipate that the remaining employee termination costs of million related to an additional employees will be paid in at december   restructuring charges of million remain accrued  primarily related to excess facility costs 
we anticipate utilizing the remaining restructuring accrual  which relates to servicing operating lease payments or negotiated buyout of operating lease commitments  through a summary of the accrued restructuring charges is as follows in millions excess leased facilities and involuntary cancelled terminations contracts total total charge cash payments reclassification balance at december  we incurred restructuring charges of million in of the total restructuring charges recorded  million related to employee termination costs covering technical  production  and administrative employees

table of contents the following table summarizes the costs and activities during  related to the restructuring in millions excess leased facilities and involuntary cancelled terminations contracts total balance at december  cash payments reclassification balance at december  asset write offs 
in connection with our restructuring in  we wrote off million of fixed assets which were determined to have no remaining useful life 
in  we wrote off million of impaired fixed assets  acquired during our acquisition of ane  which were determined to have no remaining useful life 
downturns in the broadband services and telecommunications markets created unique circumstances with regard to the assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets for recoverability during as a result of our decision to suspend certain product lines and product development efforts during the first quarter of  intangible assets totaling million related to certain acquisitions were deemed to be impaired with no future value and were written off 
further  the aforementioned downturns in the principal markets in which we continue to operate  negatively impacted the forecasted revenues and cash flows from certain other companies acquired during fiscal and in accordance with our policy and accounting standards applicable at that date  the comparison of the discounted expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the related intangible assets resulted in a write down of these assets related to both our cable and telecom segments of million during the first quarter we adopted sfas no 
on january  we reclassified million of assembled workforce  net of accumulated amortization  with an indefinite life  to goodwill at the date of adoption 
we test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the first step was completed during the second quarter of we completed the initial goodwill impairment review as of the beginning of  and found no impairment 
due to a difficult economic environment and heightened price competition in the modem and telecom businesses during the three months ended june   we experienced a significant drop in its market capitalization  and therefore proceeded to perform an interim test to measure goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at june  based on our forecast  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the goodwill would be less than its carrying amount 
we determined that the outcome of this test reflected that the fair value of the goodwill was zero 
this resulted in a non cash charge of million to write off the remaining goodwill of which million is related to the cable segment and million is related to the telecom segment 
non operating expenses for the year ended december  annual change in thousands interest income interest expense other expense gain on early retirement of debt interest income 
interest income decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower invested average cash balances due to the

revenues from telecom were million  down from million in we have a relatively small customer base  and revenues were impacted by declines in telecom industry spending 
during  the cable industry moved to purchase more standards based products  and we faced increasingly strong competition from multiple vendors  which drove down revenues through lower unit prices partially offset by higher unit volumes 
further  during  we were unfavorably impacted by declines in average selling prices asps of our modems 
in addition  revenues from our telecom segment were impacted by declines in telecom industry spending 
the intensely competitive nature of the market for broadband products resulted in significant price erosion in for the year ended december  annual change in thousands related party revenues rogers revenues shaw revenue total revenues related party revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the decline in related party revenues is primarily due to the same economic and competitive pressures discussed above 
in addition  shaw was a related party only during the first three quarters of in the fourth quarter of  shaw was no longer determined to be a related party as they no longer exercised voting rights over their shares of our stock  and a board member from shaw resigned from our board of directors 
accordingly  revenues from shaw were no longer included in related party revenues beginning in the fourth quarter of see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  annual change in thousands cost of goods sold cost of goods sold consists of direct product costs as well as the cost of our manufacturing 
the cost of the manufacturing includes contract manufacturing  test and quality assurance for products  warranty costs and associated costs of personnel and equipment 
in  cost of goods sold decreased to million from million in in and  we incurred special charges of million and million  respectively  relating to vendor cancellation charges and inventory reserves 
cost of goods sold in also included approximately million of amortization of acquired intangible assets compared to million in excluding special charges and amortization of intangible assets  cost of goods sold decreased million or due primarily to lower sales  largely offset by the usage  in the first three quarters of  
table of contents of higher priced inventories purchased in the fourth quarter of the offset due to usage of higher priced inventories results from the fact that we record cost of goods sold on a first in  first out basis

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  internally designed prototype material expenditures  non recurring outside engineering  equipment and supplies required to develop and enhance our products 
research and development expenses increased to million or of sales in the year ended december  from million or of sales in the increase of million is primarily attributable to three factors million was spent on the development of our docsis cable equipment  approximately million was spent on development efforts in our telecom segment  and we amortized million of intangible assets 
research and development expenses increased million primarily due to the development of our new line of docsis standards based products within our cable segment 
additionally  we have continued to invest in research and development efforts related to our telecom segment 
approximately million of our increase in research and development spending is attributable to increases in our telecom research and development efforts primarily related to development of integrated access devices acquired from our mainsail acquisition in the third quarter of also included in research and development costs is the amortization of intangible assets of approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cost of product development assistance agreement 
in march  we entered into a one year product development assistance agreement with rogers 
under the terms of the development agreement  rogers was obligated to assist us with the characterization and testing of our subscriber end and head end voice over cable equipment 
in addition  rogers was obligated to provide us with technology to assist us with our efforts to develop high quality  field proven technology solutions that are docsis compliant and packet cable compliant 
the development agreement had a term of one year 
in consideration of rogers entering into the development agreement  we issued rogers two fully vested and non forfeitable warrants  each to purchase million shares of our common stock on a cashless basis 
one warrant had a exercise price of 
table of contents per share and one warrant had an exercise price of per share 
the fair value of the two warrants was approximately million and resulted in a non cash charge included in operations over the one year term of the development agreement 
as a result of the development agreement  our results for the year ended december  included a non cash charge of million 
in march  rogers purchased  shares of our common stock on a net exercise basis  resulting in no proceeds to us 
in process research and development 
there were no charges for in process research and development in the year ended december  we incurred charges of million in the year ended december   related to research and development projects in process at companies that we acquired 
in chronological order of acquisition  the companies were  imedia  radwiz  telegate  ane  combox  certain assets of internet telecom  ultracom  digitrans and mainsail 
on the date of each acquisition  the projects identified as in process research and development required additional efforts in order to establish technological feasibility 
in process technology acquired relating to the acquisitions of telegate  combox  internet telecom  ultracom and digitrans  all in  and imedia corporation and radwiz ltd  in  was valued at approximately million  million  million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
during  we decided not to pursue any further development efforts on these projects for the following reasons imedia 
market interest in the capabilities represented by imedia s in process research and development changed after our acquisition 
in process research and development concentrated on improvements to the internet and on interactive services 
during  as we realized the market opportunities for internet video delivery and interactive services were significantly less than anticipated  we redirected our engineering resources into improving the existing developed technology 
radwiz 
we continued the development of radwiz s in process research and development throughout by the fourth quarter of  it was becoming apparent that engineering issues were proving to be more difficult to resolve than originally expected 
during  we refocused engineering efforts on satisfying particular customer requirements  rather than completing the development efforts underway in telegate 
we continued the development of in process research and development acquired in connection with the telegate acquisition throughout during the first quarter of  telegate s largest customer indicated that they would be significantly decreasing future purchases 
further  in april  circuit switch based cable over telephony systems were no longer considered viable 
we elected to concentrate future research and development resources on sustaining engineering activities and not to pursue in process research and development projects related to telegate technology 
ane 
development of in process technology acquired in connection with the ane acquisition  valued at approximately million  was completed during the second quarter of combox 
the success of the combox acquisition was primarily based on the success of one key customer 
during the first quarter of  this customer decided to no longer resell the combox system as the customer was unable to achieve sufficient profitability on its sales 
at this point  we elected to abandon all future development efforts related to the combox technology 
internet telecom 
in process research and development activities related to internet telecom were focused on creating a voice over ip system  a market that at the time of our acquisition  many considered poised to grow quickly in the near future 
during  we re assessed the economic viability of the cost of development of the in process research and development  the strength of other competitors systems  and the lack of demand from potential customers  and determined that further development would not produce a commercially viable product 
over several quarters in  the internet telecom engineering resources were redeployed to focus on projects based on developed other technologies 
ultracom 
during the first quarter of  we determined  due to manufacturing and production issues  the ultracom wireless chip would be difficult and expensive to produce 
meanwhile  competitors had reached the market with alternative wireless technologies  further reducing the available market potential for the ultracom chip 
after investigating engineering solutions  we determined we would have to create a new design 
table of contents concept  which would require several years of effort 
given this  we chose to abandon the in process research and development related to the ultracom technology 
digitrans 
during  we recognized that the product roadmap for digitrans products would not be on the timetable originally established at the time of the digitrans acquisition 
in an effort to ensure returns from engineering resources  we chose to focus development efforts on roadmap deliverables that were based on developed technologies and therefore did not continue investing in in process research and development efforts related to the digitrans technology 
mainsail 
in process technology acquired relating to the acquisition of mainsail in was valued at approximately million and consisted primarily of additions to mainsail s core technology  which was related to mainsail s planned development of new features 
the resultant technology provides a high capacity cpe and a low cost gateway 
this development was completed in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for sales personnel  marketing and support personnel  and costs related to trade shows  advertising  consulting and travel 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million to million or of sales in the year ended december  from million or of sales in the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to million related to increased headcount  as well as increased spending for promotional activities  including a million increase for tradeshows and field trials  a million increase for consulting services for public relations  a million increase for advertising  a million increase for administrative fees  and a million increase in other sales and marketing expenses 
also  amortization of intangible assets included in sales and marketing expenses accounted for approximately million in  an increase of million compared to million in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salary and benefits for administrative officers and support personnel  travel expenses and legal  accounting and consulting fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million or of sales in from million or of sales in the increase is primarily due to amortization of intangible assets of million in compared to only million in as well as increased headcount to support our operations 
goodwill amortization 
the amortization of goodwill arising from acquisitions completed during and decreased to million in compared to million in this decrease was due to the write down of million of acquired intangible assets during upon adoption of sfas no 
effective january   we were no longer required to amortize the goodwill assets associated with our acquisitions in and non operating expenses for the year ended december  annual change in thousands interest income interest expense other expense gain on early retirement of debt interest income 
interest income decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates as well as lower invested average cash balances due to the use of cash to repurchase convertible subordinated notes notes in and usage of cash for operations 
interest expense 
interest expense is primarily related to the sale in july of million of notes due in august interest expense increased to million during compared to 
table of contents million in primarily due to a full year of debt related to the notes in during  we repurchased approximately million in principal of the notes 
other expense 
other expense for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million in we accounted for an equity investment in accordance with sfas no 
 and sab no 
 which provides guidance in determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
in applying this guidance we evaluated  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of the investment was less than its cost  the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including factors such as industry and sector performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow  available financial information  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
during  we estimated the fair value of the long term investment  which was included in our cable segment as defined by sfas no 
 disclosures about segment of an enterprise and related information  based on these criteria  and consequently wrote down approximately million of an investment in a privately held company  which was determined to be impaired 
there were no write downs of investments in gain on early retirement of debt 
in  we repurchased approximately million of our convertible subordinated notes notes for million in cash and million in stock  resulting in a gain of approximately million net of related unamortized issuance costs of million 
in april  we adopted sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 

prior to the adoption of sfas no 
we had reported the gain from early retirement of our debt as an extraordinary item 
accordingly  we now report our gain from retirement of our notes in operations 
all prior periods reflect the adoption of sfas no 
no debt was repurchased in income taxes for the year ended december  in thousands income tax expense benefit we have generated operating losses since our inception 
in  we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million  which represented the write off of deferred tax assets  and remaining net deferred tax liabilities previously recorded for purchased acquired intangibles  net of miscellaneous foreign income taxes 
there was no provision for income taxes in stock option accounting we have elected to continue using the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based awards granted to employees until a uniform method of valuing and expensing stock options is promulgated 
accordingly  we have not recognized compensation expense for the fair value of our stock based awards to employees in our consolidated statements of income 
companies electing to remain with the intrinsic value method accounting in apb must make pro forma disclosures  as if the fair value based method of accounting had been applied

the plaintiff in the first of these lawsuits purported to represent a class whose members purchased our securities between february  and april  the complaint alleged that the defendants had violated the federal securities laws by issuing materially false and misleading statements and failing to disclose material information regarding our technology 
the allegations in the other lawsuits were substantially the same and  on august   all of these lawsuits were consolidated in the united states district court  northern district of california 
the court hearing the consolidated action has appointed lead plaintiffs and lead plaintiffs counsel pursuant to the private securities litigation reform act 
on september   the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint containing factual allegations nearly identical to those in the original lawsuits 
the consolidated class action complaint  however  alleged claims on behalf of a class whose members purchased or otherwise acquired our securities between november  and april  on october   defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint 
on march   after defendants motion had been fully briefed and argued  the court issued an order granting in part defendants motion and giving plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint 
on april   plaintiffs filed their first amended consolidated class action complaint 
on june   defendants moved to dismiss this new complaint and oral argument on the motion occurred on december  on march   the court denied the defendants motion to dismiss 
the parties are now in the discovery process 
in addition  the court has certified the plaintiffs proposed class and scheduled trial to begin on november  the lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of damages  in addition to other forms of relief 
we consider the lawsuits to be without merit and intend to defend vigorously against these allegations 
however  the litigation could prove to be costly and time consuming to defend  and there can be no assurances about the eventual outcome 
on october   a lawsuit was filed against us and the individual defendants zaki rakib  selim rakib and raymond fritz in the california superior court  san luis obispo county 
this lawsuit is titled bertram v 
terayon communications systems  inc bertram 
the bertram complaint contains factual allegations similar to those alleged in the federal securities class action lawsuit 
the complaint asserts causes of action for unlawful business practices  unfair and fraudulent business practices  and false and misleading advertising 
plaintiffs purport to bring the action on behalf of themselves and as representatives of all persons or entities in the state of california and such other persons or entities outside california that have been and are adversely affected by defendants activity  and as the court shall determine is not inconsistent with the exercise of the court s jurisdiction 
plaintiffs seek equitable and injunctive relief 
defendants removed the bertram case to the united states district court  central district of california and  on january   filed a motion to dismiss the complaint 
a hearing on defendants motion was held march  and the court granted defendants motion to dismiss the action and denied plaintiffs motion requesting remand 
on april   defendants moved for an order requiring further proceedings  if any to take place in the northern district of california 
plaintiffs did not oppose this motion and eventually entered into a stipulation to go 
table of contents forward in the northern district 
on july   a status conference was held in this case before judge patel 
plaintiffs did not appear for the conference  and the court requested that defendants submit an order dismissing the bertram action with prejudice  which the defendants have submitted to the court 
on august   the court held another conference at which it entered an order dismissing the bertram case 
the court s order permits the individual plaintiffs in the bertram case to pursue any claims that they may have as members of the purported class in the related  consolidated class action discussed above 
plaintiffs have appealed this order  and the court of appeals has set a briefing schedule for the appeal 
we believe that the allegations in the bertram case  as with the allegations in the federal securities case  are without merit and intend to contest the matter vigorously 
on may   a shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit purportedly on behalf of us against five of its current directors  two former directors and two former officers 
this lawsuit is titled campbell vs 
rakib  et al  and is pending in the california superior court  santa clara county 
we are a nominal defendant in this lawsuit  which alleges claims relating to essentially the same purportedly misleading statements that are at issue in the pending securities class action 
in that litigation  we dispute making any misleading statements 
the derivative complaint also alleges claims relating to stock sales by certain of the director and officer defendants 
on july   a shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit purportedly on behalf of us against three of our current directors  one former officer and three former investors 
this lawsuit is titled o brien vs 
rakib  et al  and is pending in the california superior court  san francisco county 
we are a nominal defendant in this lawsuit  which alleges claims relating to essentially the same purportedly misleading statements that are at issue in the pending securities class action 
in that litigation  we dispute making any misleading statements 
the derivative complaint also alleges claims relating to stock sales by certain of the director and officer defendants 
the plaintiff in the o brien case has dismissed the investor defendants without prejudice 
since the campbell and o brien cases were filed  the parties have taken steps to have these cases consolidated in the california superior court  county of santa clara 
on october   the california superior court  county of san francisco entered an order providing for the transfer of the o brien case 
on october   plaintiff in the o brien case submitted certain materials to the california superior court  county of santa clara to effectuate that transfer  which is now complete 
the o brien case is now consolidated with the campbell case 
we believe that there are many defects in the campbell and o brien derivative complaints 
on january   omniband group limited  a russian company  omniband filed a request for arbitration with the zurich chamber of commerce  claiming damages in an amount of  allegedly caused by our breach of an agreement to sell to omniband certain equipment pursuant to an agreement between omniband and radwiz ltd  our subsidiary  dated february  on february   the president of the zurich chamber of commerce appointed the chairman of a three member panel to preside over the arbitration proceedings 
we believe that the allegations are without merit and intend to present a vigorously defense in the arbitration proceedings 
on september   uniscor ltd 
an israeli company under voluntary liquidation and flextronics israel ltd  an israeli company flextronics filed a claim with the tel aviv district court in israel against us and radwiz  our subsidiary  alleging that damages of nis  approximately million us dollars were caused to them by our alleged failure to comply with its contractual obligations to accept and pay for components manufactured by flextronics in the first quarter of pursuant to projections it had received from radwiz 
we filed a statement of defense denying the allegations  after which the parties accepted the court s recommendation to transfer the case to non binding mediation 
we are currently a party to various other legal proceedings  in addition to those noted above and may become involved from time to time in other legal proceedings in the future 
while we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these other proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties 
were an unfavorable ruling to occur in any of our legal proceedings  there exists the possibility 
table of contents of a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurs 
the estimate of the potential impact on our financial position or overall results of operations for any of the above legal proceedings could change in the future 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
in july  we issued million of notes  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the notes are our general unsecured obligation and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness and to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share at any time on or after october  through maturity  unless previously redeemed or repurchased 
interest is payable semi annually 
debt issuance costs related to the notes were approximately million 
through december   we had repurchased approximately million of the notes for million in cash and million in stock  resulting in a gain on early retirement of debt of approximately million net of related unamortized issuance costs of million 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million used in in  significant uses of cash from operating activities included our losses from operations  as well as a decrease in accounts payable of million 
net cash used in operating activities were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of million in net cash used in operating activities in were primarily due to losses from operations as well as a decrease in accounts payable of million  partially offset by decreases in inventory and other current assets of million and million  respectively 
cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to a usage of million in investing activities consisted primarily of net purchases of short term investments in and cash used by financing activities was million in compared to million in in  we paid approximately million to repurchase a portion of the notes 
we received a total of million from the exercise of stock options 
in  we paid approximately million to repurchase a portion of the notes and million to retire short and long term debt 
we received a total of million in from the exercise of stock options

the obligations require us to purchase minimum quantities of the suppliers products at a specified price 
as of december   we had approximately million of purchase obligations  of which million is included in the consolidated balance sheets as accrued vendor cancellation charges  and the remaining is attributable to open purchase orders 
the remaining obligations are expected to become payable at various times through other commercial commitments  primarily required to support operating leases  are as follows in millions amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than over committed year years years years deposits standby letters of credit total commercial commitments during the third quarter of  we received approximately million shares of net servicos de comunicacao sa net servicos  a customer  valued at approximately million as settlement for all outstanding accounts receivables due from net servicos to us 
the shares of net servicos are traded on the sao paulo stock exchange  and the share price has traditionally been volatile and subject to significant price fluctuations 
at december   we had sold million shares for million 
the remaining million shares are classified as available for sale and are included in the consolidated balance sheets as short term investments 
the volatility of the share price could result in potential future losses to the market value of the remaining million shares unless and until we are able to sell them 
on february   we entered into an agreement with solectron corporation solectron to settle all outstanding obligations under two manufacturing agreements between us and solectron 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we paid solectron approximately million  and each party released any and all claims that it may have had against the other party 
additionally  terayon received selected inventory from solectron 
we previously accrued the million settlement as a vendor cancellation in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
this estimate is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results may vary as a result of a number of factors  including those discussed under the risk factor our operating results may fluctuate below and elsewhere 
we may need to raise additional funds in order to support more rapid expansion  develop new or enhanced services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements 
we may seek to raise additional funds through private or public sales of securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  financing under leasing arrangements or otherwise 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the 
table of contents percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to continue operations  develop our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
on march   we announced a worldwide reduction in force of approximately employees  or percent of the workforce  and the closure of certain remote facilities 
we expect to record total charges in the range of approximately million to million associated with the realignment and the writedown of certain related assets in the quarter ending march  we anticipate realizing annualized savings of approximately to million from these actions combined with related operational savings including the curtailment of certain program and discretionary expenditures

table of contents risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business could be harmed 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we have a history of losses and may continue to incur losses in the future 
it is difficult to predict our future operating results 
we began shipping products commercially in june  and we have been shipping products in volume since the first quarter of as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we believe that we will continue to experience difficulties in selling our products at a profit and continue to operate with net losses for the foreseeable future 
moreover  we have had declining revenue since in the twelve month period ended december   our revenues decreased from the same period in additionally  we generally are unable to reduce our expenses significantly in the short term to compensate for any unexpected delay in generating  or decrease in anticipated revenues 
for example  we have fixed commitments with some of our suppliers that require us to purchase minimum quantities of their products at a specified price irrespective of whether we can subsequently use such quantities in our products 
because in the past  we have been unable to use all of the products that we purchased from our suppliers  we have taken charges as a result of these fixed commitments  and we may have to take additional charges in the future if we are unable to use all of the products that we purchase from our suppliers 
during  we recorded an inventory charge of million to reduce some of the inventories to the lower of cost or market as average selling prices fell below the cost of these products 
in addition  we have significant operating lease commitments for facilities and equipment that generally cannot be cancelled in the short term without substantial penalties 
our business may be adversely affected by delays in  or our failure to  commercialize new products or cost reduce our current products 
moreover  given the conditions in the broadband equipment market  the profit potential of our business remains unproven 
we may experience fluctuations in our operating results and face unpredictability in our future revenues 
our quarterly revenues have and are likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that affect our revenues include  among others  the following variations in the timing of orders and shipments of our products  variations in the size of the orders by our customers and pricing concessions on volume sales  new product introductions by competitors  delays in our introduction of new products  delays in our introduction of added features to our products  delays in reducing the cost of our products  delays in commercialization of products that are competitive in the marketplace  delays in our receipt of and cancellation of orders forecasted by customers  variations in capital spending budgets of cable operators and other broadband service providers  international conflicts  including war with iraq  and acts of terrorism and the impact of adverse economic  market and political conditions worldwide  and ability of our products to be qualified or certified as meeting industry standards 

table of contents a variety of factors affecting our gross margin include  among others  the following the sales mix of our products  the volume of products manufactured  the type of distribution channel through which we sell our products  the asps of our products  the costs of manufacturing our products  and the effectiveness of our cost reduction measures 
the unit asps of our products have declined considerably in  and we anticipate that unit asps of our products will continue to decline in the future 
this has caused and will continue to cause a decrease in our gross margins if we are unable to off set the decline in asps with cost reduction measures 
in addition  the gross margins we realize from the sale of our products are affected by the mix of product sales between higher margin  lower volume head end equipment  such as cable modem termination systems cmtss  and lower margin  higher volume customer premise equipment cpe  such as modems 
in we expect that sales of our low margin cpe will continue to make up a significant portion of our revenues 
our operating expenses generally vary from quarter to quarter depending on the level of actual and anticipated business activities 
however  a significant percentage of these operating expenses are fixed due to operating leases for our facilities and equipment 
also  we have fixed commitments with some of our suppliers that require us to purchase minimum quantities of their products at a specified price 
as of december   million of purchase obligations are outstanding 
moreover  our research and development expenses fluctuate in response to new product development  changing industry requirements and customer demands 
we are dependent on a small number of customers and our business could be harmed by the loss of any of these customers or reductions in their purchasing volumes 
the markets we serve have and are continuing to undergo significant consolidation in both north america and internationally  as a limited number of cable operators control an increasing number of systems 
for example  the top ten cable operators in the united states own and operate systems that service approximately of homes that receive cable services in the united states  and the top ten cable operators in europe own and operate systems that service approximately of homes that receive cable services in europe 
as a result of the consolidation among cable operators  our revenue has been and will continue to be dependent on sales to the few leading cable operators worldwide and the continued consolidation may also reduce the number of potential customers 
for example  one of our customers accounted for more than of our total revenues for the twelve months ended december  and in the same period  four of our customers accounted for of our total revenues 
we may not succeed in attracting new customers as many of our potential customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors and the continued consolidation of the cable industry reduces the number of potential customers 
to attract new customers  we may be faced with intense price competition which may affect our gross margins 
moreover  we do not typically require our customers to purchase a minimum quantity of our products  and our customers can generally cancel their orders on short notice without significant penalties 
the loss of any of our customers can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
further  any reduction in orders from a given customer can likewise have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
the sales cycle for certain of our products is lengthy  which makes forecasting of our customer orders and revenue difficult 
the sales cycle for certain of our products  such as our cmts  is lengthy  often lasting nine months to more than a year 
our customers generally conduct significant technical evaluations  including customer trials  of our products as well as competing products prior to making a purchasing decision 
in addition  purchasing decisions may also be delayed because of our customers internal budget approval processes 
because of the lengthy sales cycle and the size of customer orders  if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular 
table of contents period do not occur in that period  our revenues and operating results for that particular quarter could suffer 
moreover  a portion of our expenses related to an anticipated order is fixed and difficult to reduce or change  which may further impact our revenues and operating results for a particular period 
there are many risks associated with our participation in industry standards 
in connection with the development of the docsis specification by cable television laboratories  inc a cable industry consortium that establishes cable technology standards and administers compliance testing cablelabs  we entered into an agreement with cablelabs whereby we licensed to cablelabs on a royalty free basis any of our intellectual property rights  including rights to our proprietary s cdma technology  to the extent that such rights may be asserted against a party desiring to design  manufacture or sell docsis based products  including docsis based products 
this license agreement grants to cablelabs the right to sublicense our intellectual property  including our intellectual property rights in our s cdma patents  to manufacturers that compete with us in the marketplace for docsis based products 
as a result of this license to cablelabs  our competitors that produce docsis based products have access to our technology without having to pay us any royalties or other compensation for the use of our technology 
as a result of our contribution of technology to the docsis intellectual property pool  we may have foregone significant revenue from the potential licensing of our proprietary technology  and we may be unable to recoup the investment in the research and development efforts to develop the intellectual property contributed to the docsis technology pool 
additionally  the agreement that we signed with cablelabs to participate in the docsis intellectual property pool may make it difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights against other companies 
certain cable equipment vendors manufacture and sell docsis based and docsis certified and qualified product without sublicensing from cablelabs the technology in the cablelabs intellectual property pool 
due to the interests of cable operators in having as many equipment vendors as possible  we may feel constrained by competitive pressures from pursuing the enforcement of our intellectual property rights against our competitors that have not entered into sublicenses with cablelabs 
moreover  if we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights against other equipment manufacturers that access technology from the cablelabs intellectual property pool  our license to the technology in the pool may be jeopardized 
certain contributors of technology to the cablelabs intellectual property pool are our competitors and may elect to revoke our license to their technology if we attempt to enforce our intellectual property rights against them 
we may have lost any competitive advantage that our proprietary s cdma technology may have provided us in the marketplace by licensing it to cablelabs  and we may face increased competition because our competitors have the ability to incorporate our technology into their products 
we believe that this increased competition could come from existing competitors or from new competitors who enter the market and that such competition is likely to result in lower product asps  which could harm our revenues and gross margins 
additionally  because our competitors will be able to incorporate our technology into their products  our current customers may choose alternate suppliers or choose to purchase docsis compliant products from multiple suppliers 
we may be unable to effectively compete with the other vendors if we cannot produce docsis compliant cable products more quickly or at lower cost than our competitors 
docsis specifications have not yet been accepted in europe and asia  although an increasing number of asian cable operators are requiring product to be docsis qualified or certified 
an alternate specification for cable products  called the euro docsis specification  has been formalized by tcomlabs for european cable operators  and some european and asian cable operators have embraced it 
we intend to develop and sell products that comply with the euro docsis specification  which may require the contribution of certain of our technologies  including our proprietary s cdma technology  to the euro docsis specification 
we may be unsuccessful in these efforts  and even if we are successful  we may face some of the same risks associated with our contribution of intellectual property to cablelabs docsis intellectual property pool 

table of contents we need to certify and qualify our new and existing products to meet industry specifications in order to remain competitive 
major cable operators worldwide have endorsed the docsis and packetcable specifications and rarely purchase equipment that is not certified or qualified as compliant with these specifications 
cable operators have chosen to purchase only product meeting industry specifications because the specifications enable interoperability among products from multiple vendors  which leads to increased competition among equipment manufacturers and consequently lowers product asps 
consequently  our future success depends on our ability to compete effectively in this marketplace by developing  marketing and selling products that are certified and qualified to industry standards in a timely fashion 
the docsis and packetcable specifications are promulgated by cablelabs 
currently these specifications have been widely adopted by cable operators in north america and by some cable operators in asia  latin america and europe 
the euro docsis specifications has been developed by tcomlabs  a cable technology consortium of european cable operators  specifically to meet the requirements of european operators  and has found some acceptance in china as well 
there is no guarantee that our products will be docsis  eurodocsis or packetcable certified or qualified 
if we are unable to certify or qualify our products as docsis  eurodocsis or packetcable compliant in a timely manner  we may be unable to sell our products and may lose some or all of any advantage we might otherwise have had  and our future operating results may be adversely affected 
though we sell docsis certified and qualified products  there have been and may continue to be instances where our existing customers and potential new customers elect to purchase docsis products from one or more of our competitors rather than from us 
in response to this situation  we have reduced our prices and continue to experience customer demand to further reduce our prices in order to promote sales of our current products 
this has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our revenues  operating results and gross margin 
developing products to meet these various industry specifications has several risks 
the first is the cost and effort to engineer standards based products and to then prepare them for compliance testing 
not only do we have to certify or qualify new products  but any of our currently certified or qualified products must be re certified or re qualified should they be changed in any way 
second  there is no guarantee that these products will be certified or qualified as meeting these specifications in a timely fashion  if ever 
because most cable operators purchase only those products that have been certified or qualified as meeting these specifications  it is highly unlikely that we will be able to sell our products until they achieve certification or qualification  which can be a lengthy process 
as a result  we may incur significant research and development expenses to develop new products that may not receive certification or qualification and we cannot recoup the costs of these research and development expenses by marketing uncertified or unqualified products 
moreover  a consequence of cable operators only purchasing products certified or qualified as meeting industry specifications is the increased competition between equipment vendors  which has resulted in a steady and ongoing decline in equipment prices as vendors compete for cable operators business 
third  there is no guarantee that we will be able to support all future cable industry specifications  which will likely have an adverse impact on future revenues 
average selling prices of broadband equipment continue to decline  which is decreasing our gross margins 
the broadband equipment market has been characterized by erosion of product asps 
we expect this erosion to continue 
the asps for our products are likely to continue to decline due to competitive pricing pressures  promotional programs and customers possessing strong negotiating positions who require price reductions as a condition of purchase 
in addition  we believe that the widespread adoption of industry specifications  such as the docsis and eurodocsis specifications  is further eroding asps as cable modems and other similar cpe become commodity products 
decreasing asps could result in decreased revenues even if the number of units sold increases 
decreasing asps may also require us to sell our products at much lower gross margin than in the past  and in fact  we may sell products at a loss 
the primary reason 
table of contents that our gross profits have declined year over year is the decline in product s asps 
as a result  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future revenue  gross margin and operating results due to asp erosion 
therefore  we must continue to develop and introduce on a timely basis and a cost effective manner new products or next generation products with enhanced functionalities that can be sold at higher gross margins 
our failure to do this could cause our revenues and gross margin to decline 
we must achieve cost reductions to attain profitability 
as product asps and revenue have declined in recent years  we have not sufficiently decreased our costs  including operating expenses and the costs associated with our products  to offset declining asps and revenue 
this has resulted in increased losses making it difficult for us to attain profitability 
during  we saw an increase in the unit sales of our products  however  we experienced a decrease in revenue of from the same period in  which was  in large part  due to declining product asps 
in order to achieve profitability  we must significantly reduce our operating expenses and the cost of our products 
we have made several attempts to lower our operating expenses 
although we have implemented expense reduction and restructuring plans in the past  including the latest restructuring in march  that have focused on cost reductions and operating efficiencies  we have not been successful in lowering our operating expenses to keep pace with the decline in revenues  and we cannot be certain that our future efforts implementing operating expense reduction will be successful 
a large portion of our expenses  including rent  and operating lease expenditures  is fixed and difficult to reduce or change 
accordingly  if our revenue does not meet our expectations  we may not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in revenue 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as product asps rapidly decline  we need to reduce the cost of our products through design and engineering changes 
we may not be successful in redesigning our products  and  even if we are successful  our efforts may be delayed or our redesigned products may contain significant errors and product defects 
in addition  any redesign may not result in sufficient cost reductions to allow us to reduce significantly the list price of our products or improve our gross margin 
reductions in our product costs will require us to use lower priced components that are highly integrated in future products and may require us to enter into high volume or long term purchase or manufacturing agreements 
volume purchase or manufacturing agreements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and we could incur significant expenses without related revenues if we cannot use the products or services offered by such agreements 
we have incurred significant cancellation charges related to volume purchase and manufacturing agreements in the past and may incur such charges in the future 
broadband services delivered by cable operators have not achieved widespread market penetration  and other competing service providers exist 
our success will depend upon the widespread penetration of broadband services delivered by cable television operators 
the markets for these services are growing  but are not fully developed nor exploited 
additionally  these markets may not grow as cable operators have a limited amount of available bandwidth over which they can offer new services  such as high speed internet access and telephony 
cable operators may elect not to provide any or all of these new services to their customers or may not aggressively market these services to their customers 
if cable operators elect not to deploy such new services or if customers elect not to subscribe to such services  it may affect our ability to sell products to cable operators as their existing equipment may meet their current infrastructure demands 
we depend on cable operators to provide new services and maintain their infrastructure in such a manner that allows us to continue to sell products to them 
cable operators must also compete with other service providers in the delivery of services to their customers 
clecs  ilecs  satellite tv and broadband service providers are aggressively competing with the cable industry to deliver broadband services via dsl or satellite broadcast technologies 
we cannot accurately predict the future growth rate or the ultimate size of the market for broadband services delivered via cable 
the success of clecs  ilecs  satellite tv and other broadband service providers may slow or hamper the 
table of contents continued acceptance of cable operators broadband services  which in turn may impact demand for our products by cable operators 
we need to develop additional distribution channels to market and sell our products 
we presently market our products primarily to cable operators worldwide 
to increase worldwide sales of our products  we need to establish new distribution channels 
we face many challenges in establishing these new distribution channels 
these challenges include  among others  the following the ability to hire additional personnel necessary to establish and enhance these new distribution channels  the extent to which consumer electronics companies enter the cable modem market  as their retail distribution capabilities would provide them with a significant competitive advantage  the ability to find and train channels to effectively market our more complex products  such cmtss and cherrypickers  the ability to maintain acceptable margins for our low margin products  such as cable modems  when sold through a distributor  and our potential distribution partners are likely to prefer purchasing products from larger  more established manufacturers 
the vast majority of our sales are to large cable operators 
however  we currently have limited access to smaller or geographically diverse cable operators 
although we intend to establish strategic relationships with leading distributors worldwide to access these customers  we may not succeed in establishing these relationships 
even if we do establish these relationships  the distributors may not succeed in marketing our products to their customers 
some of our competitors have already established  long standing relationships with these cable operators that may limit our and our distributors ability to sell our products to those customers 
even if we were to sell our products to those customers  it would likely not be based on long term commitments  and those customers would be able to terminate their relationships with us at any time without significant penalties 
in addition  we anticipate that the north american cable modem market may at some point shift to a consumer purchase model 
in this occurs  our success will depend on our ability to effectively sell our products in the consumer market 
we may not have the capital required or the necessary personnel or expertise to develop these distribution channels 
also  some of our competitors  including motorola and thomson consumer electronics  have well established retail distribution capabilities and existing brands with market acceptance that would provide them with a significant competitive advantage 
reduced capital spending by cable operators could impact sales of our cable products 
our success and future growth will be subject to economic and other factors affecting cable operators  particularly their ability to finance substantial capital expenditures 
capital spending levels in the cable industry in the united states and internationally have fluctuated significantly in the past  and we believe that such fluctuations will occur in the future 
we are currently experiencing reduced levels of spending by cable operators 
the capital spending patterns of cable operators are dependent on a variety of factors  including the following the availability of financing  annual budget cycles  as well as the typical reduction in upgrade projects during the winter months  the status of federal  local and foreign government regulation and deregulation of the telecommunications industry  overall demand for broadband services  
table of contents competitive pressures including the availability of alternative data transmission and access technologies  discretionary consumer spending patterns  and general economic conditions 
in recent years  the cable market has been characterized by consolidation 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that such consolidation will have on overall capital spending patterns by cable operators 
the effect on our business of further industry consolidation also is uncertain 
we may fail to accurately forecast customer demand for our products 
the nature of the cable industry makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast demand for our products 
our inability to forecast accurately the actual demand for our products may result in too much or too little supply of products or an over under capacity of manufacturing or testing resources at any given point in time 
the existence of any one or more of these situations could have a negative impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we had purchase obligations of approximately million as of december   primarily to purchase minimum quantities of materials and components used to manufacture our products 
we must fulfill these obligations even if demand for our products is lower than we anticipate 
we may have financial exposure to litigation against our directors and officers 
we and or our directors and officers are defendants in a number of lawsuits  including securities litigation lawsuits 
as a result  we may have financial exposure to litigation as a defendant and because we are obligated to indemnify our officers and members of our board of directors for certain actions taken by our officers and directors on our behalf 
in order to limit financial exposure arising from litigation and or our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors  we have historically purchased directors and officers insurance d o insurance 
however  the availability of d o insurance is becoming more difficult for companies to attain as a number of insurance underwriters no longer offer d o insurance and the remaining insurance underwriters offering d o insurance have significantly increased the premiums of such coverage 
during  we experienced a significant increase in the cost of our d o insurance  and there can be no assurance that d o insurance will be available to us in the future or  if d o insurance is available  it may be prohibitively expensive 
additionally  some insurance underwriters who offered d o insurance in the past have been placed into liquidation or may be  at some future point  placed into liquidation 
in october  one of the insurance underwriters from which we purchased d o insurance  reliance insurance co 
reliance  was placed into liquidation by the state of pennsylvania 
reliance was the underwriter for one excess layer of our d o insurance for the period covering the claims made against us and our officers in the pending securities litigation 
because reliance is in liquidation  we will be responsible for the amount insured under the reliance policy  which is approximately million 
we are dependent on key third party suppliers and any failure by them to deliver components could limit our ability to satisfy customer demand 
we manufacture all of our products using components or subassemblies procured from third party suppliers 
some of these components are available from a sole source and others are available from limited sources 
a majority of our sales are from products containing one or more components that are available only from sole source suppliers 
additionally  some of our components are custom parts that are produced to our specifications  and it may be difficult to move the manufacturing of such components from one vendor to another vendor 
any interruption in the operations of our vendors of sole source or custom product parts could adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to customers 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components from our current sources  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays or reductions in product 
table of contents shipments could damage customer relationships and expose us to potential damages that may arise from our inability to supply our customers with products 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could harm our gross margin or operating results 
we may be unable to migrate to new semiconductor process technologies successfully or on a timely basis 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to develop products that utilize new semiconductor process technologies 
these technologies change rapidly and require us to spend significant amounts on research and development 
we continuously evaluate the benefits of redesigning our integrated circuits using smaller geometry process technologies to improve performance and reduce costs 
the transition of our products to integrated circuits with increasingly smaller geometries will be important to our competitive position 
other companies have experienced difficulty in migrating to new semiconductor processes and  consequently  have suffered reduced yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels 
moreover  we depend on our relationship with our third party manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully 
our ability to directly control product delivery schedules and product quality is dependent on third party contract manufacturers 
most of our products are assembled and tested by contract manufacturers using testing equipment that we provide 
currently  our modems are sole sourced from our manufacturer in thailand 
as a result of our dependence on these contract manufacturers for the assembly and testing of our products  we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality 
any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacturing  assembling or testing our products 
in addition  as manufacturing volume increases  we will need to procure and assemble additional testing equipment and provide it to our contract manufacturers 
the production and assembly of testing equipment typically requires significant lead times 
we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are unable to provide this testing equipment to our contract manufacturers in a timely manner 
there are many risks associated with international operations 
we expect sales to customers outside of the united states to continue to represent a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
in fiscal  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our net revenues were from customers outside of the us international sales are subject to a number of risks  including the following changes in foreign government regulations and communications standards  export license requirements  tariffs and taxes  trade barriers  difficulty in protecting intellectual property  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  currency fluctuations difficulty in managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 
if our customers are affected by currency devaluations or general economic downturns  such as the economic downturns affecting many asian  european and latin american economies  their ability to purchase our products could be reduced significantly 
payment cycles for international customers typically are longer than those for customers in north america 
foreign countries may decide to prohibit  terminate or delay the construction of new cable infrastructures for a variety of reasons 
these reasons include environmental issues  economic downturns and availability of favorable pricing for other communications services or the 
table of contents availability and cost of related equipment 
any action like this by foreign countries would reduce the market for our products 
while we generally invoice our foreign sales in us dollars  we invoice the majority of our sales in europe in euros 
since we have also elected to take payment in euros from our customers in europe and may elect to take payment in other foreign currencies  we are exposed to losses as the result of foreign currency fluctuations 
we currently do not engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
we may choose to limit our exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts or through similar hedging strategies 
no currency hedging strategy can fully protect against exchange related losses 
in addition  if the relative value of the us dollar in comparison to the currency of our foreign customers should increase  the resulting effective price increase of our products to those foreign customers could result in decreased sales 
our business may be affected by conditions in israel 
we have significant operations in israel 
our operations in israel consist primarily of research and development  and to a lesser extent sales and manufacturing 
revenues generated by our business in israel were million  million and million for the twelve months ending december   and  respectively 
our research and development operations may be significantly affected by conditions in israel 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
hostilities within israel have continued to escalate over the past year  which could disrupt some of our operations 
we could be adversely affected by any major hostilities involving israel 
as a result of the hostilities and unrest presently occurring within israel  the future of the peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors is uncertain 
a number of our employees based in israel are currently obligated to perform annual military reserve duty and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
we cannot assess the full impact of these requirements and the hostilities on our workforce  business or operations if conditions should change  and we cannot predict the effect of any expansion or reduction of these obligations or the hostilities 
we may be unable to provide adequate customer support 
our ability to achieve our planned sales growth and retain current and future customers will depend in part upon the quality of our customer support operations 
our customers generally require significant support and training with respect to our products  particularly in the initial deployment and implementation stages 
spikes in demand of our support services may cause us to be unable to serve our customers 
we may not have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers may require during initial product deployment or on an ongoing basis especially during peak periods 
our inability to provide sufficient support to our customers could delay or prevent the successful deployment of our products 
in addition  our failure to provide adequate support could harm our reputation and relationships with our customers and could prevent us from selling product to existing customers or gaining new customers 
our industry is highly competitive with many established competitors 
the market for our products is extremely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change 
our direct competitors include cisco systems  adc  arris  bigband networks  juniper networks  com  motorola  thomson consumer electronics which markets products under the brand name rca  scientific atlanta and toshiba 
we also compete with companies that develop integrated circuits for broadband products  such as broadcom  conexant and texas instruments 
the principal competitive factors in our market include the following product performance  features and reliability  price  size and stability of operations  breadth of product line  
table of contents sales and distribution capabilities  technical support and service  relationships with providers of service providers  and compliance with industry standards 
some of these factors are outside of our control 
conditions in the market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements 
the development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete 
our competitors may introduce products that are less costly  provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution  customer support and other resources  as well as better name recognition and access to customers than we do 
the widespread adoption of docsis and other industry standards has and is likely to continue to cause increased price competition 
we believe that the adoption of these standards have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in lower asps for our products 
any increased price competition or reduction in sales of our products  particularly our higher margin head end products  has and will continue to result in decreased revenue and downward pressure on our gross margin 
these competitive pressures have and are likely to continue to adversely impact our business 
we are dependent on key personnel 
due to the specialized nature of our business  we are highly dependent on the continued service of  and on the ability to attract and retain  qualified engineering  sales  marketing and senior management personnel 
the competition for some of these personnel is intense 
the loss of any of these individuals may harm our business 
in addition  if we are unable to hire qualified personnel as needed  we may be unable to adequately manage and grow our business 
highly skilled employees with the education and training that we require  especially employees with significant experience and expertise in both data networking and radio frequency design  are in high demand 
we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we do not have key person insurance coverage for the loss of any of our employees 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
our employees are not bound by non competition agreements with us 
our business is subject to the risks of product returns  product liability and product defects 
products like ours are very complex and can frequently contain undetected errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
despite testing  errors may occur 
the occurrence of errors could result in product returns and other losses to us and or our customers 
this occurrence could result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products 
we have limitation of liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale 
however  these terms and conditions may not be effective as a result of federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions in the united states or other countries 
the sale and support of our products entails the risk of product liability claims 
in addition  any failure by our products to properly perform could result in claims against us by our customers 
we maintain insurance to protect against certain claims associated with the use of our products  but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any claim asserted against us 
in addition  even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and management time and resources 
we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products 
even though we seek to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products  there are risks 
our pending patent applications may not be granted 

table of contents even if they are granted  the claims covered by the patent may be reduced from those included in our applications 
any patent might be subject to challenge in court and  whether or not challenged  might not be broad enough to prevent third parties from developing equivalent technologies or products without a license from us 
we also believe that companies may be increasingly subject to infringement claims as distressed companies and individuals attempt to generate cash by enforcing their patent portfolio against a wide range of products 
we have received a letter from a company claiming that our technology and products infringe on its patents 
we have consulted with our patent counsel and are in the process of reviewing the allegations made by such company 
there can be no assurance that  if the issue were to be submitted to a court  such court would not find that our products infringe the patents  nor that the company will not continue to allege infringement 
if we are found to have infringed such company s patents  we could be subject to substantial damages and or an injunction preventing us from conducting our business 
additionally  there can be no assurance that other third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
any such claim  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees  and we enter into non disclosure agreements with many of our suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
these contractual arrangements  as well as statutory protections  may not prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our trade secrets or technology or deter independent third party development of similar technologies 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
cablelabs docsis specification includes two modulation techniques  s cdma and a tdma 
in connection with the development of the docsis specification by cablelabs  we entered into an agreement with cablelabs  on a royalty free basis  whereby we licensed to cablelabs many of our intellectual property rights to the extent that such rights may be asserted against a party desiring to design  manufacture or sell docsis based products  including docsis based products 
this license agreement grants to cablelabs the right to sublicense our intellectual property  including our intellectual property rights in our s cdma patents  to manufacturers that compete with us in the marketplace for docsis based products 
we pursue the registration of our trademarks in the united states and have applications pending to register several of our trademarks throughout the world 
however  the laws of certain foreign countries might not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
effective trademark  copyright  trade secret and patent protection may not be available in every country in which our products may be manufactured  marketed or sold 
our business and our customers are subject to regulation 
our business and customers are subject to varying degrees of regulation by regulatory bodies in the united states and foreign countries 
although these regulations have not materially restricted our operations to date or the operations of our customers  future regulations applicable to our business or customers could be adopted 
the adoption of future regulations may adversely affect our customers  our ability to sell our products and therefore our operating results 
our products are subject to safety approvals and certifications 
in the united states  our products are required to meet certain safety requirements 
for example  we are required to have our products certified by underwriters laboratory in order to meet federal requirements relating to electrical appliances to be used inside the home 
outside the united states  our products are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which the products are manufactured or sold 
these 
table of contents requirements are likely to vary widely 
we may be unable to obtain on a timely basis or at all the regulatory approvals that may be required for the manufacture  marketing and sale of our products 
we are vulnerable to earthquakes  labor issues and other unexpected events 
our corporate headquarters  as well as the majority of our research and development activities and some manufacturing operations are located in california  an area known for seismic activity 
in addition  the operations of some of our key suppliers are also located in this area and in other areas known for seismic activity  such as taiwan 
an earthquake  or other significant natural disaster  could result in an interruption in our business or the operations of one or more of our key suppliers 
our business may also be impacted by labor issues related to our operations and or those of our suppliers  service providers  or customers 
such an interruption could harm our operating results 
we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate for any losses that we may sustain as a result of any natural disasters or other unexpected events 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition  we may incur substantially more debt 
as of december   we had approximately million of indebtedness outstanding 
this level of indebtedness may adversely affect our stockholders by making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our growth strategy  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt 
we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
the terms of our outstanding debt do not fully prohibit us from doing so 
if new debt is added to our current levels  the related risks described above could intensify 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
our stock price could be subject to extreme fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the broadband services industry  changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of internet  online service or broadband service industries  our announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  adoption of industry standards and the inclusion or compatibility of our technology with such standards  
table of contents adverse or unfavorable publicity regarding us or our products  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of common stock  and other events or factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq national market and the stock price for broadband services and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume volatility and a significant cumulative decline since the second quarter of this volatility and decline has affected many companies irrespective of or disproportionately to the operating performance of these companies 
additionally  industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
the current war with iraq and threatened terrorist attacks may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
the current war with iraq and the events of september   as well as future events occurring in response to or in connection with them  including  without limitation  future terrorist attacks against united states targets  or military or trade disruptions impacting our domestic or foreign suppliers of components required for the manufacturing of our products  may cause delays or losses of customer orders 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economic 
they also could result in economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs 
we may not be able to raise additional funds to continue operating our business 
our main source of liquidity continues to be our unrestricted cash on hand 
in addition and as a result of our history of operating losses  we expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash to fund operating losses in the future 
we believe that our current unrestricted cash on hand should be adequate to fund our working capital needs through however  if our operating losses are more severe than expected or continue longer than expected  we may find it necessary or desirable to seek other sources of financing to support our capital needs and provide available funds for working capital 
given the current state of the telecommunications industry including equipment manufacturers that supply product to the telecommunications industry and the capital markets  there are few available sources of financing 
commercial bank financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms 
accordingly  any plan to raise additional capital  if available to us  would likely involve an equity based or equity linked financing  such as the issuance of convertible debt  common stock or preferred stock  which would be dilutive to our stockholders 
if we are unable to procure additional working capital  as necessary  we may be unable to continue operations 
our restructuring efforts could result in the erosion of employee morale  legal actions against us and management distractions  and could impair our ability to respond rapidly to growth opportunities in the future 
as a result of the significant economic downturn and the related uncertainties in the technology sector  we have implemented a number of restructuring plans  including the most recent in march  which has resulted in personnel reduction 
these reductions could result in an erosion of morale  and affect the focus and productivity of our remaining employees  including those directly responsible for revenue generation  which in turn may affect our revenue in the future 
additionally  employees directly affected by the reductions may seek future employment with our business partners  customers or competitors 
although all employees are required to sign a proprietary information agreement with us at the time of hire  there can be no assurances that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
additionally  we may face wrongful termination  discrimination  or other claims from employees affected by the reduction related to their employment and termination 
we could incur substantial costs in 
table of contents defending ourselves or our employees against such claims  regardless of the merits of such actions 
furthermore  such matters could divert the attention of our employees  including management  away from our operations  harm productivity  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
we cannot assure you that our restructuring efforts will be successful  and we may need to take additional restructuring efforts  including additional personnel reduction  in the future 
we may dispose of existing product lines  which may adversely impact our future results 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our various product offerings in order to determine whether any should be discontinued or  to the extent possible  divested 
moreover  the worldwide downturn in the telecommunications industry led us to reassess our business strategy  which in turn caused us to discontinue investment in certain product lines 
for example  we have reduced our investment in the telecom and satellite spaces and discontinued our internet over satellite product line 
we cannot assure you that we correctly forecasted the right product lines to discontinue or that our decision to discontinue various investments and product lines is prudent if market conditions change 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the discontinuance of various product lines will reduce our operating expenses 
furthermore  future plans to discontinue existing product lines entail various risks  including the risks that we will not be able to find a buyer for a product line or the purchase price obtained will not be equal to the book value of the assets for the product line 
products currently under development may fail to realize anticipated benefits 
the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and relatively short product life 
the pursuit of necessary technological advances and the development of new products require substantial time and expense 
for example  we made ten acquisitions during the period between and due to various economic conditions  none of the products from our acquired businesses have achieved the level of market acceptance that was forecasted at the time of their acquisitions 
additionally  certain product groups have not achieved the level of technological development needed to be marketable or to expand the market 
as a result  we recorded various impairment charges and wrote off significant amounts of in process research and development related to the acquired technologies  both of which negatively impacted our operating results 
we cannot assure you that technologies currently under development will achieve feasibility or that even if we are successful  the developed product will be accepted by the market 
we may not be able to recover the costs of existing and future product developments and our failure to do so may materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets  which could result in material losses 
most of our sales are on an open credit basis  with payment terms of days typically in the united states  and because of local customs or conditions  longer in some markets outside the united states 
we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such an open credit arrangement  seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts 
beyond our open credit arrangements  we have also experienced a request for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements  which we have not provided to date and do not expect to provide in the future 
we expect demand for enhanced open credit terms  for example  longer payment terms  customer financing and leasing arrangements to continue and believe that such arrangements are a competitive factor in obtaining business 
our decision not to provide these types of financing arrangements may adversely affect our ability to sell product  and therefore  our revenue  operations and business 
because of the current slowdown in the global economy  our exposure to credit risks relating to sales on an open credit basis have increased 
although we monitor and attempt to mitigate the associated risk  including monitoring customers located in certain geographic areas  there can be no assurance that our efforts will be effective in reducing credit risk 
additionally  there have been significant insolvencies and bankruptcies among our customers  which have and may continue to cause us to incur economic and financial losses 
there 
table of contents can be no assurance that additional losses would not be incurred and that such losses would not be material 
although these losses have generally not been material to date  future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we have and we may seek to expand our business through acquisitions  acquisitions could disrupt our business operations and harm our operating results 
in order to expand our business  we may make strategic acquisitions of other companies 
we plan to continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions from time to time  and may make an acquisition at some future point 
however  the current volatility in the stock market and the current price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to make such acquisitions 
any acquisition that we make involves substantial risks  including the following difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired company  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in process research and development  difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
acquisitions may also cause us to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  assume liabilities  record goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges  incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets  incur large and immediate write offs  or become subject to litigation 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way 
even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products  there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that all pre acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 
we made ten acquisitions during the period between and due to various economic conditions  none of the products from our acquired businesses have achieved the level of market acceptance that was forecasted at the time of their acquisitions 
additionally  certain product groups have not achieved the level of technological development needed to be marketable or to expand the market 
we recorded impairment losses of approximately million and million of intangible assets related to these acquisitions in december  and as of december   no intangible assets from these acquisitions remain 

table of contents we have adopted a stockholder rights plan  which  together with provisions in our charter documents and delaware law  may delay or prevent an acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of our stock 
we adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which we distributed one right for each outstanding share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of february  because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting a take over of us  even if such a change in control is beneficial to our stockholders  without the approval of our board of directors  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock  without first negotiating with our board of directors 
additionally  provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our board of directors  and we have also opted out of the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could also have the effect of delaying or preventing our acquisition by a third party 
various export licensing requirements could materially and adversely affect our business or require us to significantly modify our current business practices 
various government export regulations may apply to the encryption or other features of our products 
we may have to make certain filings with the government in order to obtain permission to export certain of our products 
in the past  we may have inadvertently failed to file certain export applications and notices  and we may have to make certain filings and request permission to continue exportation of any affected products without interruption while these applications are pending 
if we do have to make such filings  we cannot assure you that we will obtain permission to continue exporting the affected products or that we will obtain any required export approvals now or in the future 
if we do not receive the required export approvals  we may be unable to ship those products to certain customers located outside of the united states 
in addition  we may be subject to fines or other penalties due to the failure to file certain export applications and notices 
item a 
market risk disclosure information interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which mature within the next twenty four months 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decline less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
foreign currency risk 
a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activity are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions from belgium  united kingdom  hong kong  canada  and israel 
a hypothetical adverse change of in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of approximately million 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions at december  actual results may differ materially
