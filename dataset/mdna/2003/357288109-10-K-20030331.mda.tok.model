additionally  there are certain corporate revenues and expenses  comprised primarily of investment income  interest expense and certain general and administrative expenses  that are not allocated by fremont to fgcc or to the discontinued insurance operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented under item and the business section presented under item results of operations the following table presents a summary of the company s income loss before taxes and net after tax income loss for the years ended december   and year ended december  thousands of dollars income loss before taxes financial services unallocated corporate interest and other expenses income before income taxes income tax expense net income from continuing operations discontinued insurance operations  net of tax extraordinary gains on extinguishment of debt  net of tax net income loss the financial services segment recorded income before taxes of million for  as compared to million and million for and  respectively

the increase in income before taxes for  as compared to  is primarily related to a significant increase in gains from the whole loan sales of residential real estate loans and an approximate increase in average interest earning assets 
offsetting this in was a significant increase in the provision for loan losses and higher levels of loans on non accrual status 
see the financial services operation section herein for additional detail 
the company  based upon the results of its year end actuarial evaluations which reflected adverse loss development  determined that the financial position of its discontinued insurance operations had experienced further deterioration 
as a result  the company no longer expects to recover any of its current investment in its discontinued insurance operations and that a write down of the entire amount was warranted 
the company s net investment in its discontinued insurance operations  prior to the write down  was million as of december  in addition  based on the level of financial deterioration in the discontinued insurance operations indicated at december   the company also accrued a charge for all of its potential future capital contributions to its discontinued insurance operations 
these future contributions include both mandatory and contingent capital contributions as per the company s july agreement with the california department of insurance doi 
the total amount of these future contributions is million and are payable ratably at million annually for the next six years 
the million 
table of contents represents the company s maximum amount of liability for capital contributions to its discontinued insurance operations under its agreement with the doi 
further  as a result of the restrictions in the july agreement with the doi  the additional adverse loss development  and other actions taken by the doi during the fourth quarter of  including placing further restrictions on the discontinued insurance operation s ability to direct the activities of the run off of the discontinued insurance operations  the company no longer has effective control of these operations and its activities are done at the consent and under the direction of the doi 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of the discontinued insurance operations as of december   have been removed from the consolidated balance sheet of fremont 
the total discontinued insurance operations impairment charge is million before taxes and is comprised of the write down of the million net investment and a loss accrual of million for the net present value of the million in future capital contributions 
the million loss results in an after tax charge of million which is reported separate from net income from continuing operations 
the substantial net loss for the year ended december  for the discontinued insurance operations is predominantly the result of the recognition of an increase of million in the gross liability for loss and loss adjustment expense lae reserves during the quarter ended june   and the recognition of million in certain charges during the quarter ended december  associated with the restructuring of the workers compensation insurance operation 
unallocated corporate interest and other expenses during the year ended december  consisted primarily of investment income revenue  offset by unallocated corporate expenses consisting primarily of interest expense and general and administrative expenses 
the unallocated corporate interest and other expense loss before taxes for the year ended december   was million as compared to million and million  for and  respectively 
the increase in  as compared to  is due primarily to increased incentive compensation expenses  and to a lesser degree  lower investment income due to a lower interest rate environment 
this was offset by reductions of million in interest expense due to the reduced level of principal outstanding under the company s publicly traded senior notes due and senior notes due together the senior notes 
the increase in  as compared to  is due primarily to decreased intercompany revenues at fremont 
management fees comprised of the allocation of certain costs incurred by fremont for the rendering of various services to its subsidiaries  substantially all from the discontinued workers compensation insurance subsidiaries  decreased approximately million  as the size of the workers compensation insurance operation was reduced and  under an agreement dated november  with the doi  a significant amount of these fees were deferred  and not recognized by fremont as income due to the uncertainty of their ultimate collection 
fremont has historically not charged applicable management fees in any significant amount to fgcc 
lower interest rates on investments resulted in investment income declining million in from as discussed further in this paragraph  there was no affiliate interest income in  compared to million in this was offset by reductions of million in interest expense due to the reduced level of principal outstanding under the senior notes and million in other corporate expenses 
the lower affiliate interest income resulted from the conversions on january  and april  of approximately million and million  respectively  in notes receivable due from these subsidiaries to common equity in the subsidiaries  thereby establishing capital contributions to them 
the january  conversion transaction affected fgcc  the downstream holding company subsidiary that holds the industrial bank subsidiary 
the april  conversion transaction impacted the downstream holding company subsidiary that holds the discontinued insurance subsidiaries 
with these debt conversions  beginning january   and to a larger extent april   the unallocated corporate interest expense is  and will continue to be  higher 
after these conversions  there is no affiliate debt due from the downstream holding company subsidiaries

during the year ended december   fremont extinguished million in principal amount of its senior notes due during the year ended december   fremont extinguished million and million  respectively  in principal amount of its senior notes due and senior notes due during the year ended december   fremont extinguished million and million  respectively  in principal amount of its senior notes due and senior notes due 
table of contents in addition  during each of and  fremont extinguished million of principal amount at maturity of its publicly traded liquid yield option notes due the lyons 
after tax gains of million  million and million  respectively  were recognized from these extinguishments during  and the after tax gain is reported as an extraordinary item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
income tax expense of million  million and million for   and  represents effective tax rates of  and  respectively  on income before taxes from continuing operations 
the effective tax rates for the three periods presented are different than the federal enacted tax rate of  due mainly to higher state income tax provisions within the financial services operation 
the significant change in effective tax rates in  as compared to and  is a result of a decision to increase by million an accrual for certain pending state tax issues 
in  million of the accrued amount was reversed as a result of the expected favorable resolution of certain of these matters

financial services operation year ended december  thousands of dollars financial services interest and fee income on loans interest income on investment securities total interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses gain on sale of residential real estate loans other non interest income operating expenses income before income taxes the financial services operation s income before taxes was million for the year this is a increase when compared to s income before taxes of million 
this increase in earnings is a result of the following net interest income increased to million in from million in on an increase in net interest earning assets 
net interest earning assets averaged billion in  up from an average of billion in net interest income  as a percentage of average net interest earning assets  increased significantly in to from in the primary reasons for the increase in the average net interest earning assets for were a increase in the average balance of residential real estate loans in the portfolio and held for sale combined and an increase in the average balance of commercial real estate loans in the portfolio 
the increase in net interest income  as a percentage of average net interest earning assets  is due to wider spreads between the cost of funds and the yields on commercial and the significant increase in the average residential real estate loans  which generally have wider margins than the commercial real estate loans 
net gains on the sales of residential real estate loans increased significantly from million in to million in this increase was due to a significant increase in the amount of loans sold and an increase in the prices realized on the sale of these loans 
loans sold in totaled 
table of contents billion  up from billion in this is reflective of a significant increase in total residential real estate loans originated 
during  billion in residential real estate loans were originated  as compared to billion in loans held for sale also increased from million at december  to billion at december  the gross premium on loan sales during was  up from in this is reflective of improved market conditions  a lower interest rate environment and increased acceptability of the loans originated by the company 
the increase in earnings in was partially offset by significantly increased provisions for loan losses 
the provision for totaled million  up from million in the increase in the provision is due in part to an increase in the loan portfolio outstanding excluding loans held for sale from billion at december  to billion at december   but is primarily due to the company incurring increased net loan charge offs and non accrual loans during  and increasing its allowance for loan losses in response to its evaluation of expected  and often uncertain  future trends in general economic conditions and their impact upon the commercial real estate market in particular 
non accrual loans in the loan portfolio excluding loans held for sale increased during from million at december  to million at december  net loan charge offs increased significantly to million for  as compared to million for of the million in net charge offs in  million were related to commercial real estate loans  million to syndicated commercial loans and million to residential real estate loans 
this is compared to net loan charge offs in of million for commercial real estate loans  million for syndicated commercial loans and million to residential real estate loans 
loan charge offs for commercial real estate increased as a result of weakened economic conditions in general 
the largest individual net charge off on a commercial real estate loan in was million 
of the million in total commercial real estate net loan charge offs for  approximately were related to loans with properties located in california  as compared to approximately of the total commercial real estate loan portfolio being secured by properties located in california 
the increase in net charge offs from the syndicated loan portfolio occurred primarily from the company s decision to begin to significantly downsize this business during and from the effect of economic conditions in on this portfolio

includes loans held for sale and other consumer loans 
the net interest margin as a percentage of average interest earning assets increased to for  as compared to for the increase in the net interest margin is due primarily to higher net spreads between commercial and residential real estate loan yields and the effective cost of funds employed to fund these assets  as well as the effect of a higher yielding mix of interest earning assets ie  an increased average balance of higher yielding residential real estate loans and lower average balances of lower yielding syndicated commercial loans and investment securities 
interest yields on deposits and federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings declined on a year to year comparison more than the yields on commercial and residential real estate loans did 
this is due in part to the presence of interest rate floors ie  the total of the variable base rate  such as six month libor  plus the related spread on a commercial real estate loan will not contractually drop below a certain absolute level  such as on a significant number of the company s commercial real estate loans  as well as various economic and market factors 

table of contents the net interest margin as a percentage of average interest earning assets decreased to for  as compared to for the decrease for is due primarily to the effect of an increase in non interest accruing loans and the differential between the repricing of variable rate loans receivable and the deposits which fund the loans when interest rates were declining during loans receivable  non performing assets and reserve activity

the level of non performing assets fluctuates and specific loans can have a material impact upon the total 
as of december   non performing commercial real estate loans and reo were comprised of non accrual loans and four reo properties  as compared to non accrual commercial real estate loans and three reo properties at december  and non accrual commercial real estate loans and two reo properties at december  consideration must be given that  due to the secured nature of the company s loans and the presence of larger balance loans  the classification  and the timing thereof  of an individual loan as non performing or reo can have a significant impact upon the level of total non performing assets  without necessarily a commensurate increase in loss exposure 
as of december   non accrual residential real estate loans 
table of contents including loans held for sale and reo had decreased to million from million at december  and million at december  the decrease in non accrual loans is primarily the result of a concerted and ongoing effort by the company to reduce these non performing assets through sales to other financial institutions 
the syndicated loan group had four loans in non performing status at december   and only one each at december  and  with balances of million  million and million  respectively 
see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail on non performing assets 
during the year ended december   there were commercial real estate loans with a total balance of million that were modified in connection with loan restructurings and remained on accrual status 
of these loans  one total balance of million was ultimately foreclosed upon and in reo status at december  and three loans were paid off in full 
the remaining nine loans  with a total balance of million as of december   were performing within their contractual terms and were in accrual status at december  the company incurred a total of million in net loan charge offs related to the restructuring of these loans during  of which million was related to one individual loan

the ratio of net charge offs to average total loans receivable increased in to from in and in the increase in the ratio for is primarily a result of increased commercial real estate net loan charge offs  as well as  to a lesser degree  increased syndicated commercial loan net charge offs 
substantially all of the increase in the ratio for is due to million in net charge offs for the syndicated commercial loan portfolio during the syndicated commercial loan portfolio had no net charge offs during the net charge off ratio for commercial real estate loans for increased to as compared to for and for the following table summarizes the amounts of residential real estate loan sales  and related net gain  net of reductions in the carrying valuations of loans held for sale  during the years of  and  by type of sale thousands of dollars residential real estate loan sales whole loan sales securitizations total residential real estate loan sales net gains recognized on residential real estate loan sales discontinued insurance operations the property and casualty insurance operation  which was primarily represented by the underwriting of workers compensation insurance policies  was classified as discontinued during the fourth quarter of the intention at that time was to allow the liabilities primarily loss and lae reserves related to the discontinued insurance business to run off and  as a result  the property and casualty insurance operation was accounted for as a discontinued operation using the liquidation basis of accounting 
accordingly  the company s operating results for and prior periods were restated to reflect reporting in this manner for all periods presented 
in july  fremont executed a definitive agreement with the doi that would allow the company s discontinued workers compensation insurance subsidiary  with the oversight of the doi  to self administer the run off of policies currently in force by paying claims and operating expenses in the ordinary course of business and also preserve fremont s net operating loss carryforwards attributable to its discontinued workers compensation insurance subsidiary 
the agreement also obligates fremont to make certain additional 
table of contents capital contributions to its discontinued workers compensation insurance subsidiary 
further  as a result of the restrictions in the july agreement with the doi  the additional adverse loss development  and other actions taken by the doi during the fourth quarter of  including placing further restrictions on the discontinued insurance operation s ability to direct the activities of the run off of the discontinued insurance operations  the company no longer has effective control of these operations and its activities are done at the consent and under the direction of the doi 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of the discontinued insurance operations as of december  have been removed from the consolidated balance sheet of fremont 
for additional detail on the discontinuance of the property and casualty insurance operation see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements 
market risk the company is subject to market risk resulting primarily from fluctuations in interest rates arising from balance sheet financial instruments such as investments  loans and debt 
changes in interest rates can affect loan interest income  gains or losses on loan sales  interest expense  loan origination volume  net investment income  and total stockholders equity 
the objective of the asset and liability management activities is to provide the highest level of net interest and investment income and to seek cost effective sources of capital  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk 
no derivative financial instruments were owned at december  and  consequently  the company is not subject to market risk for such off balance sheet financial instruments 
furthermore  there is no exposure to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
financial services operation interest rate risk the financial services operation is subject to interest rate risk resulting from differences between the rates on  and repricing characteristics of  interest earning loans receivable and loans held for sale and the rates on  and repricing characteristics of  interest bearing liabilities used to finance its loans such as thrift deposits and debt 
interest rate gaps may arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals or different market indices to which the instruments interest rate is tied and to this degree earnings will be sensitive to interest rate changes 
additionally  interest rate gaps could develop between the market rate and the interest rate on loans in the financial services loan portfolio  which could result in borrowers prepaying their loan obligations 
while the company attempts to match the characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the effect of fluctuations in interest rates  it does not currently utilize derivative financial instruments to meet these objectives 
for the financial services operation  the expected maturity date does not necessarily reflect the net market risk exposure because certain instruments are subject to interest rate changes before expected maturity 
as part of its residential real estate mortgage banking operations  the company enters into commitments to originate loans interest rate lock commitments  which represent commitments that have been extended by the company  generally for the period of days  at a stated interest rate to its potential borrowers 
the company determined that its interest rate lock commitments have met the definition of derivatives under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  however  the impact of the change in fair value of such derivative instruments is not material to the company s results of operations 
typically  the company hedges the risk of overall changes in the fair value for its loans held for sale through entering into forward loan sale commitments

the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the existing portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loss 
table of contents based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio  the composition of the portfolio  specific impaired loans and current economic conditions 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans on which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  management s estimate of probable loan losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance 
income taxes the company currently has significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realization of the deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income as the assets arise primarily from the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
management s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  loan loss experience  and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances
