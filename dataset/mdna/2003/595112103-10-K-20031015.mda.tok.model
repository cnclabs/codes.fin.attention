forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements such as those made in gross margin regarding manufacturing cost reductions in future periods  the estimated amount of write down remaining in inventory at the end of the first quarter of and relative gross margins on tech products in the first quarter of  in research and development regarding expenses related to  and initial product qualifications of  the company s mm production line  in restructure and other charges regarding the effect of the restructure and the estimated cost savings in future periods  income taxes regarding taxes from the company foreign operations and in liquidity and capital resources regarding achievement of certain milestones associated with the intel investment and regarding capital spending in the company s actual results could differ materially from the company s historical results and those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  those identified in certain factors 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis 
all tabular dollar amounts are in millions 
the company s fiscal year is the or week period ending on the thursday closest to august fiscal years  and each contained weeks and ended on august   august   and august   respectively 
the company s fiscal  which ends on september   contains weeks and the first quarter of fiscal  which ends on december   contains weeks 
all period references are to the company s fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions 
the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
contingencies the company is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies 
an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 
income taxes the company is required to estimate its provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world 
estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex 
resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 
the company is also required to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap  which requires the assessment of the company s performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets 
realizability of deferred tax assets is dependent on the company s ability to generate future taxable income 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value 
cost includes labor  material and overhead costs  including product and process technology costs 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories 
to project average selling prices and sales volumes  the company reviews recent sales volumes  existing customer orders  current contract prices  industry analysis of supply and demand  seasonal factors  general economic trends and other information 
when these analyses reflect estimated market values below the company s manufacturing costs  the company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold 
differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of write down recorded 
due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry  actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and  as a result  the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 
for example  a variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated fair value of the company s inventory by approximately million at the end of the fourth quarter of us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values 
the amount of any inventory write down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories 
a majority of the company s inventory has been categorized as volatile primarily dram or non volatile flash 
the major characteristics the company considers in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 
product and process technology costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by the company are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over periods currently ranging up to years 
the company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents filed 
capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of i the estimated useful life of the technology  ii the patent term or iii the term of the technology agreement 
property  plant and equipment the company reviews for impairment the carrying value of property  plant and equipment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and or disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by the company  including  but not limited to  future use of the assets for company operations versus sale or disposal of the assets  future selling prices for the company s products and future production and sales volumes 
in addition  judgment is required by the company in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 
research and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development when incurred 
determining when product development is complete requires judgment by the company 
the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability and is internally qualified for sale to customers 
subsequent to product qualification  product costs are valued in inventory 
results of operations amounts in millions and as a percent of net sales net sales    gross margin selling  general and administrative research and development restructure and other charges operating loss   the company s operating results in recent periods have been significantly affected by the timing of inventory write downs and restructure charges 
in the second quarter of  the company announced a series of cost reduction initiatives including the shutdown of its mm wafer fabrication line in virginia  the discontinuance of certain product lines  including sram and tcam products  and an approximate reduction in its worldwide workforce 
in connection with its restructure plan  the company s results of operations for include restructure and related charges of million 
see restructure and other charges and item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements restructure and other charges 
the following table summarizes the company s operating losses absent the inventory write downs and the estimated aggregate effects of previous write downs and restructure charges 
these adjusted amounts have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  however the company believes this information may be useful in assessing the effects of inventory write downs and the restructure and related charges on the company s operating loss and analyzing the company s operating loss trends

the company granted toshiba an option to require the company to repurchase on october   all of these shares for million cash 
toshiba has exercised the option and the company will redeem these shares in the first quarter of see item financial statements notes to consolidated financial statements redeemable common stock  and acquisition of toshiba corporation dram assets 
net sales net sales for increased by as compared to  primarily due to a increase in megabits of memory sold 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices in as compared to for the company s semiconductor memory products following a decrease in average selling prices in as compared to the average selling price for the company s primary product  the meg ddr  decreased approximately comparing the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of ddr products constituted of the company s megabits sold in megabits produced increased in compared to principally due to completion of the company s process technology migration to nanometer nm and continuing transition to nm geometries and improved manufacturing yields 
megabits sold in slightly outpaced production resulting in lower levels of finished goods inventories at the end of as compared to the end of average selling prices for the fourth quarter of increased by approximately as compared to the third quarter of net sales for decreased by as compared to  primarily due to the decline in average selling prices for the company s semiconductor products 
megabits sold increased by approximately in as compared to gross margin the company s gross margin has been significantly affected by the timing of inventory write downs 
in recent periods  average selling prices for the company s semiconductor products have been below costs  and accordingly  the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition have been adversely affected 
if the estimated market values of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date are below the company s manufacturing cost of these products  the company recognizes a charge to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of inventories to their estimated market values 
in recent years  the company recorded charges to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of its inventories to their estimated market values 
as these charges are recorded in advance of when inventory subject to the write down is sold  gross margins in the period of sale are higher than they would be absent the effect of the previous write downs 
the following table sets forth adjusted gross margins absent the inventory write downs and the estimated net effect of previous write downs 
these adjusted amounts have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  however the company believes this information may be useful in assessing the effects of inventory write downs on the company s gross margin and analyzing the company s gross margin trends 
amounts in millions and as a percent of net sales gross margin as reported period end inventory write down estimated net effect of previous write downs as adjusted the company s reported gross margin for improved as compared to  primarily due to a decrease in per megabit manufacturing costs  partially offset by the decrease in average selling prices for the company s semiconductor products and the net effects of current and previous period inventory write downs 
the company was able to significantly reduce per megabit manufacturing costs in through improvements in manufacturing efficiencies 
during  the company completed its migration to nm process technology and continued to transition to nm technology 
the company expects to achieve further manufacturing cost reductions over the next several quarters in connection with the continued transition to nm devices 
the company s gross margin for the fourth quarter of of million benefited from the approximate increase in average selling prices as compared to the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a write down of million to record work in process and finished goods inventories  consisting primarily of flash products  at their estimated market values 
the company s reported gross margin for decreased as compared to  primarily due to the decrease in average selling prices per megabit of memory  partially offset by the effects of inventory write downs and reductions in per megabit manufacturing costs for the company s semiconductor products 
of the cumulative inventory write downs recognized  the company estimates that approximately million is associated with product remaining in inventory as of august  the company estimates that approximately half of this amount will remain in inventory at the end of the first quarter of subject to specific terms and conditions  the company has agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by its joint venture memory manufacturing operation  tech semiconductor singapore pte 
ltd 
tech 
tech supplied approximately  and of the total megabits of memory produced by the company in  and  respectively 
the company generally purchases semiconductor memory products from tech at prices determined quarterly  based on a discount from average selling price realized by the company for the immediately preceding quarter 
the company performs assembly and test services on product manufactured by tech 
the company also provides certain technology  engineering and training support to tech 
all of these transactions with tech are recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from tech 
depending on market conditions  the gross margin from the sale of tech products may be higher or lower than the gross margin from the sale of products manufactured by the company s wholly owned facilities 
the company realized significantly higher gross margin percentages on sales of tech products than for products manufactured by its wholly owned facilities in and and lower gross margins on sales of tech products for the company expects gross margins on sales of tech products in the first quarter of to be higher than gross margins realized on products manufactured by the company s wholly owned facilities 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in as compared to  primarily due to costs associated with outstanding legal matters 
sg a decreased in as compared to sg a for included a contribution charge of million for the market value of the company s equity interest in interland  which was contributed to the micron technology foundation  and million from the company s web hosting operations  which were disposed of in august in addition  technical and professional fees associated with the implementation of the company s business software and legal costs were lower in as compared to see item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements contingencies 
research and development research and development r d expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed  the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development  and personnel costs 
the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability and is internally qualified for sale to customers 
because of the lead times necessary to manufacture the company s products  the company typically begins to process a significant volume of product before it is internally qualified 
as a result  r d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 
product development costs are recorded as r d expense 
the company s r d expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
r d expenses related to the company s mm production line are expected to increase in the first quarter of as additional development wafers are processed 
r d expenses related to the company s mm production line are expected to decrease after initial product qualification  which is expected to occur by the end of calendar the company s process technology r d efforts are focused on its nm  nm and nm line width process technologies  which are designed to facilitate the company s transition to next generation products 
additional r d efforts include processes to support mm wafer manufacturing  flash  cmos imagers  and new memory manufacturing materials 
in addition to its process technology efforts  the company continues to emphasize product designs that utilize advanced process technology 
efforts toward the design and development of new products are concentrated on the company s meg and gig ddr  ddr  gddr  flash memory products  cmos imagers and other dram products  including reduced latency dram rldram and cellular ram 
restructure and other charges as a result of the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor memory industry and the company s recent operating losses  in the second quarter of the company announced a plan to restructure its operations 
the restructure plan included the shutdown of the company s mm production line in virginia  the discontinuance of certain memory products  including sram and tcam products  and an approximate reduction of the company s worldwide workforce 
in connection with the plan  the company recorded a restructure charge of million in in addition  the company recorded other restructure related charges of million to write down the carrying value of raw materials and work in process inventories associated with discontinued products 
these other charges are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated summary of operations 
the company has substantially completed the restructure plan 
the components of the restructure and other charges were as follows restructure charge write down of equipment severance and other termination benefits write down of intangible assets other total restructure charge other charges to write down raw materials and work in process inventories total restructure and other charges through august   the company had paid essentially all of the severance and other termination benefits and million of other costs incurred in connection with the restructure plan 
as of august   the company s accounts payable and accrued expenses included million for remaining costs accrued in connection with the restructure plan 
the company expects its restructure efforts to result in a lower overall cost structure  to provide better focus on products with greater potential for growth and profitability and to allow continuing investment in new technology 
the company expects to realize annualized cost savings in excess of million as a result of this restructure plan 
other operating expense other operating expense for includes losses net of gains on write downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of million and losses from changes in currency exchange rates of million 
other operating expense for is net of million in receipts from the us government in connection with anti dumping tariffs 
other operating expense for includes losses net of gains on write downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of million 
other operating expense for includes losses of million from the write off of certain costs related to the company s lehi facility and losses net of gains on write downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of million 
income taxes the income tax provision for was million  which primarily reflects taxes on non us operations 
income tax benefit for and was million and million  respectively 
the company recognized no tax benefit on its domestic net operating losses in in  the company recorded a million charge to the provision for income taxes to establish a valuation allowance against its us deferred tax assets 
as of august   the company had aggregate us tax net operating loss carryforwards of billion and unused us tax credits of million  which expire in various years through the company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of billion for tax purposes which expire in various years through and unused state tax credits of million for tax and financial reporting purposes which expire in various years through until the company utilizes these net operating loss carryforwards and unused tax credits  the company expects its income tax provision will primarily reflect taxes from the company s non us operations

on its future results of operations and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources as of august   the company had cash and marketable investments totaling million  compared to  million as of august   which included million of marketable investments with maturities of more than one year 
during  the company received net financing proceeds of million from the issuance of seven year convertible subordinated notes the notes and net proceeds of million from the issuance of other debt 
in conjunction with the issuance of the notes  the company spent million to purchase call spread options 
during  expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million and payments on equipment purchase contracts and debt were million 
the company received income tax refunds of million in the first quarter of on september   the company received million from intel corporation intel in exchange for the issuance of stock rights exchangeable into approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
in conjunction with the issuance of the stock rights  the company agreed to achieve operational objectives through may  including certain levels of ddr production and mm wafer processing capacity  and dedication of resources to advanced product development 
in the event the company fails to achieve certain milestones and the company s common stock price is then below intel s purchase price of  the company could be obligated to pay intel amounts not to exceed million  a substantial portion of which is payable  at the company s election  in the company s common stock 
the operational objectives are in line with the company s business plans and currently the company is confident that each associated milestone will be met 
the company believes that to develop new product and process technologies  support future growth  achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality  it must continue to invest in manufacturing technology  facilities and capital equipment  research and development  and product and process technology 
the company expects capital spending to approximate billion in capital spending estimates include expenditures for ongoing equipment upgrades and expenditures for the company s mm production line 
as of august   the company had commitments extending into of approximately million for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment 
the company has historically utilized external sources of financing to fund a portion of operations and since april has had a shelf registration statement in place pursuant to which the company may from time to time issue debt or equity securities of up to billion 
the company may also seek to raise funds through issuing securities not covered by the existing shelf registration statement  by increasing the size of the existing shelf registration statement or pursuing other external sources of financing 
the company has pledged million as cash collateral for tech s credit facility 
in the event the cash collateral is used to discharge obligations of tech that are unpaid and due under the tech credit facility  certain shareholders of tech have agreed to indemnify the company for approximately one half of the amount of the cash collateral used to satisfy such obligations 
in connection with the acquisition of the virginia facility from toshiba  the company issued million shares of common stock 
the company granted toshiba an option to require the company to repurchase on october   all of these shares for million cash 
toshiba has exercised the option and the company will redeem these shares in the first quarter of fiscal in february  the company issued million of notes 
the issuance costs associated with the notes totaled million and the net proceeds to the company from the offering of the notes were million 
holders of the notes may convert all or some of their notes at any time prior to maturity  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  into the company s common stock at a conversion rate of shares for each  principal amount of notes 
this conversion rate is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
the company may redeem the notes at any time after february   at declining premiums to par 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  the company purchased call spread options the call spread options covering million shares of the company s common stock  which is the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the notes in full 
the call spread options have a lower strike price of  a higher strike price of  may be settled at the company s option either in cash or net shares and expire on january  settlement of the call spread options in cash on january   the expiration date  would result in the company receiving an amount ranging from zero if the market price per share of the company s common stock is at or below to a maximum of million if the market price per share of the company s common stock is at or above 
settlement of the call spread options in net shares on the expiration date would result in the company receiving a number of shares of the company s common stock  not to exceed million shares  with a value equal to the amount otherwise receivable on cash settlement 
should there be an early unwind of the call spread options  the amount of cash or net shares potentially received by the company will be dependent upon then existing overall market conditions  and on the company s stock price  the volatility of the company s stock and the amount of time remaining on the call spread options 
the call spread options therefore have the potential of limiting the dilution associated with the conversion of the notes from million shares to as few as million shares 
the call spread option transactions  including fees and costs of million  are accounted for as capital transactions 
as of august   maturities of notes payable  future minimum lease payments under capital leases and minimum commitments under operating leases were as follows fiscal year notes capital leases operating leases and thereafter certain factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form k  the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our memory products which have adversely affected our business 
in six of the last seven fiscal years  we experienced decreases in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products as follows in  in  in  in  in and in in recent periods  average selling prices for our semiconductor products have been below our costs 
if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per megabit costs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if average selling prices of semiconductor products do not improve relative to our costs  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments 
our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold  average selling prices and per megabit manufacturing costs 
in recent periods  average selling prices have been below our costs 
to develop new product and process technologies  support future growth  achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality  we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology  facilities and capital equipment  research and development  and product and process technology 
if average selling prices do not improve relative to our costs  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations or make adequate capital investments 
in addition to cash provided by operations  we have historically utilized external sources of financing 
however  depending on general market and economic conditions or other factors  we may not be able to access capital markets for funds on acceptable terms 
increased worldwide dram production or lack of demand for semiconductor products could lead to further declines in average selling prices for dram 
the transition to smaller geometries and mm wafers in the industry could  depending upon the rate of transition  lead to a significant increase in the worldwide supply of dram 
increases in worldwide supply of dram also result from dram fab capacity expansions  either by way of new facilities  increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to dram production 
some of our competitors may receive government support to withstand downturns in the semiconductor memory market and to invest in technology resulting in higher levels of worldwide supply than would otherwise exist 
increases in worldwide supply of dram  if not offset by increases in demand  could lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
depressed pricing for semiconductor memory products may lead to future losses and inventory write downs 
we recorded inventory write downs aggregating million in  million in and million in as a result of the significant decreases in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products 
if average selling prices are below our costs in future periods  we expect to continue to incur losses on product sales and our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if the estimated market values of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date are below the manufacturing cost of these products  we recognize charges to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of our inventories to market value 
if the growth rate of either computers sold or the amount of semiconductor memory included in each computer decreases  sales of our semiconductor products could decrease 
we are dependent on the computing market as most of the semiconductor products we sell are used in computers  servers or peripheral products 
approximately of our sales of semiconductor products for was to the computing market 
drams are the most widely used semiconductor components in computers 
in recent years  the growth rate of computers sold has slowed or declined 
if we experience a sustained reduction in the growth rate of either computers sold or the average amount of semiconductor memory included in each computer  sales of our semiconductor products could decrease  and our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 
we face intense competition from a number of companies  including elpida memory  inc  hynix semiconductor  inc  infineon technologies ag and samsung electronics  inc some of these competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete  invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities 
these competitors seek to increase silicon capacity  improve yields  reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs 
these factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices 
historically  various governments have provided economic assistance to international competitors  which has enabled  or artificially supported  competitors production of semiconductor memory  particularly dram 
this factor is expected to lead to a continued increase in the supply of dram and other semiconductor products in future periods 
current economic and political conditions may harm our business 
global economic conditions and the effects of military or terrorist actions may cause significant disruptions to worldwide commerce 
if these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  a decrease in corporate spending on information technology or our inability to effectively market  manufacture or ship our products  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if  for any reason  we are unable to access the capital markets over an extended period of time  we may be unable to make property  plant and equipment expenditures  implement our research and development efforts or fund our operations  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if any one of our major computing customers significantly reduces its purchases of dram from us  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
aggregate sales to two of our computing customers approximated of our net sales in if any one of our major computing customers significantly reduces its purchases of dram from us  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if our tech joint venture experiences financial difficulty  or if our supply of semiconductor products from tech is disrupted  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
tech supplied approximately  and of our total megabits of memory produced in  and  respectively 
we have agreements to purchase all of the products manufactured by tech subject to specific terms and conditions 
any reduction in supply could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have pledged million as cash collateral for tech s credit facility 
in the event the cash collateral is used to discharge obligations of tech that are unpaid and due under the tech credit facility  certain shareholders of tech have agreed to indemnify us for approximately one half of the amount of the cash collateral used to satisfy such obligations 
as of august   we had remaining unamortized costs of million in intangible assets relating to the supply arrangement to purchase product from tech 
in the event that our supply of semiconductor products from tech is reduced or eliminated  we may be required to write off part or all of these assets and our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we may be unable to maintain or reduce per megabit manufacturing costs at the same rate as we have in the past 
historically  we have decreased per megabit manufacturing costs through improvements in our manufacturing processes  including reducing the die size of our existing products 
in future periods  we may be unable to maintain our per megabit manufacturing costs or reduce costs at historical rates 
our ability to maintain or reduce per megabit manufacturing costs in future periods may be affected by our ability to successfully implement product and process technology upgrades  specifically our ongoing transition to nm process technologies and future transitions to nm and nm process technologies  our manufacturing wafer output or yields  which may decrease as we implement more complex technologies  including our transition to mm wafer processing  and our ability to ramp the latest reduced die size versions of existing devices or new generation devices 
if we are unable to respond to customer demand for diversified semiconductor memory products or are unable to do so in a cost effective manner  we may lose market share and our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in recent periods  the semiconductor memory market has become relatively segmented  with diverse memory needs being driven by the different requirements of desktop and notebook computers  servers  workstations  handheld devices  and communications  industrial and other applications that demand specific memory solutions 
we currently offer customers a variety of products  including ddr  sdram  flash and cmos image sensors 
in addition  we are designing and developing other semiconductor products  including ddr  gddr  reduced latency dram  cellularram and cmos image sensors 
we need to dedicate significant resources to product design and development to respond to customer demand for the continued diversification of semiconductor products 
if we are unable to invest sufficient resources to meet the diverse memory needs of customers  we may lose market share 
in addition  as we diversify our product lines we may encounter difficulties penetrating certain markets  particularly markets where we do not have existing customers 
if we are unable to respond to customer demand for market diversification in a cost effective manner  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
an adverse determination that our products and processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries  from time to time  others have asserted  and may in the future assert  that our products or processes infringe their product or process technology rights 
we are currently engaged in litigation with rambus  inc rambus relating to certain of rambus patents and certain of our claims and defenses 
on august   we filed a declaratory judgment action against rambus  inc rambus in us district court for the district of delaware 
on february   we amended our complaint 
pursuant to our amended complaint  we are seeking relief under the federal antitrust laws for violations by rambus of section of the sherman act  a declaratory judgment a that certain rambus patents are not infringed by us  are invalid  and or are unenforceable due to  among other reasons  rambus fraudulent conduct in misusing and enforcing those patents  b that we have an implied license to those patents and c that rambus is estopped from enforcing those patents against us because of its conduct in the joint electron device engineering council  a standard setting organization  and damages and declaratory relief for rambus breach of contract  fraud  deceptive trade practices  negligent misrepresentation  and conduct requiring the application of equitable estoppel 
on february   rambus filed an answer and counterclaim against us in delaware denying we are entitled to relief  alleging infringement of the eight rambus patents named in our declaratory judgment claim  and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief 
a number of other suits between rambus and us have been filed in europe 
on september   rambus filed suit against micron semiconductor deutschland gmbh in the district court of mannheim  germany  alleging that certain sdram and ddr sdram products infringe german patent and utility model counterparts to european patent on september   rambus filed suit against micron europe limited in the high court of justice  chancery division in london  england  alleging that certain sdram and ddr sdram products infringe the uk counterpart to european patent on september   rambus filed a complaint against us and reptronic a distributor of our products in court of first instance of paris  france  alleging that certain sdram and ddr sdram products infringe the french counterpart to european patent on september   we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of milan  italy  alleging invalidity and non infringement of the italian counterpart to european patent on september   rambus filed a preliminary proceeding against us and ebv a distributor of our products in the civil court of monza  italy  alleging that certain sdram products infringe the italian counterpart to european patent  and seeking the seizure of certain materials and the entry of a preliminary injunction as to products manufactured at our avezzano  italy  site 
on december   an appeals panel of the court of monza held that the monza trial court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate the seizure matter 
the monza trial court order that technical review proceedings continue with respect to the issue of preliminary injunction 
on may   the trial court rejected rambus assertions of infringement and denied its request for a preliminary injunction 
rambus appeal from the trial judge s ruling was rejected by the monza appeals panel on july  on december   we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of avezzano  italy  alleging invalidity and non infringement of the italian counterpart to european patent on august   rambus filed suit against us and assitec an electronics retailer in the civil court of pavia  italy  alleging that certain ddr sdram products infringe the italian counterpart to european patent in its various european suits against us  rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief 
we are unable to predict the outcome of these suits 
a court determination that our manufacturing processes or products infringe the product or process rights of others could result in significant liability and or require us to make material changes to its products and or manufacturing processes 
any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements 
some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments 
we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future 
we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 
allegations of anticompetitive practices 
on june   we received a grand jury subpoena from the us district court for the northern district of california seeking information regarding an investigation by the antitrust division of the department of justice the doj into possible antitrust violations in the dynamic random access memory or dram industry 
we are cooperating fully and actively with the doj in its investigation 
subsequent to the commencement of the doj investigation  a number of purported class action lawsuits were filed against us and other dram suppliers 
sixteen cases were filed between june   and september   in the following federal district courts one in the southern district of new york  five in the district of idaho and ten in the northern district of california 
each of the federal district court cases purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who purchased dram directly from the various dram suppliers during a specified time period commencing on or after october  the complaints allege price fixing in violation of the sherman act and seek treble monetary damages  costs  attorneys fees  and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct 
the foregoing federal district court cases have been transferred to the us district court for the northern district of california san francisco for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings 
eight additional cases were filed between august   and march   in the following california state superior courts five in san francisco county  one in santa clara county  one in los angeles county and one in humbolt county 
each of the california state cases purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchased dram during a specified time period commencing december  the complaints allege violations of california s cartwright act and state unfair competition law and unjust enrichment and seek treble monetary damages  restitution  costs  attorneys fees  and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct 
the foregoing california state cases have been transferred to san francisco county superior court for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings 
we are unable to predict the outcome of these suits 
based upon our analysis of the claims made and the nature of the dram industry  we believe that class treatment of these cases is not appropriate and that any purported injury alleged by plaintiffs would be more appropriately resolved on a customer by customer basis 
we can give no assurance that the final resolution will not result in significant liability and will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if we are unable to successfully transition our operations to mm wafer processing at the appropriate time  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we have in the past reduced our per megabit manufacturing costs by transitioning to larger wafer sizes 
by transitioning to larger wafers  we should be able to produce significantly more die for each wafer  ultimately resulting in substantially reduced costs for each die 
our transition to mm wafer processing across a significant portion of our operations will require us to make substantial capital investments  which will depend on our ability to generate funds from operations or to obtain additional funds from external sources 
we may also experience disruptions in manufacturing operations and reduced yields during our transition to larger wafer sizes 
if we are unable to successfully transition to mm wafer processing at the appropriate time  we could be at a cost disadvantage with respect to our competitors and our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
new product development may be unsuccessful 
we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology 
we anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years 
there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful  that we will be able to cost effectively manufacture these new products  that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will recover costs of development efforts 
we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
sales to customers outside the united states approximated of our consolidated net sales in in addition  we have or support manufacturing operations in italy  japan  puerto rico  scotland and singapore 
our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  export duties  changes to import and export regulations  and restrictions on the transfer of funds  political and economic instability  problems with the transportation or delivery of our products  issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  and compliance with trade and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions 
these factors may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if our manufacturing process is disrupted  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance 
difficulties in the manufacturing process can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per megabit manufacturing costs 
from time to time  we have experienced minor disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages 
if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason  manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers 
this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships  which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 
disruptions in our supply of raw materials could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards 
we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials 
however  only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards 
various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers  photomasks  chemicals  gases  lead frames and molding compound 
shortages may occur from time to time in the future 
in addition  any transportation problems could delay our receipt of raw materials 
lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past 
if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to achieve certain milestones  we could be obligated to pay intel corporation amounts up to million 
in conjunction with the issuance of stock rights to intel in september  we agreed to achieve operational objectives through may  including certain levels of ddr production and mm wafer processing capacity  and dedication of resources to advanced product development 
if we fail to achieve certain milestones and our common stock price is then below intel s purchase price of  we could be obligated to pay intel amounts up to million  a substantial portion of which is payable  at our election  in our common stock 
products that do not meet specifications or that contain  or are perceived by our customers to contain  defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex  it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications  contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses 
if  despite design review  quality control and product qualification procedures  problems with nonconforming  defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products  we could be adversely affected in the following ways we may need to replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product  and we may encounter adverse publicity  which could cause a decrease in sales of our products 
we expect to make future acquisitions where advisable  which involve numerous risks 
we expect to make future acquisitions where we believe it is advisable to enhance our market position 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including increasing our exposure to changes in average selling prices for semiconductor memory products  difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities  increasing debt to finance any acquisition  diverting management s attention from normal daily operations  managing larger operations and facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  and hiring and retaining key employees 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and future acquisitions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk substantially all of the company s investments are at fixed interest rates  therefore  the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of investments is minimal as the company s investments generally mature within one year 
all of the company s debt is at fixed interest rates  therefore  the fair value of the debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates 
the estimated fair market value of the company s debt as of august  and august   approximated billion and million  respectively 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement the swap that effectively converts  beginning august   the fixed interest rate on the company s million convertible subordinated notes the notes to a variable interest rate based on the month london interbank offering rate libor less basis points 
the swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the swap is expected to be highly effective at offsetting the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the notes attributable to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the functional currency for substantially all of the company s operations is the us dollar 
the company held aggregate cash and other assets in foreign currency valued at us million as of august   and us million as of august  including deferred income tax assets denominated in japanese yen valued at us million as of august   and us million as of august  
the company also held aggregate foreign currency liabilities valued at us million as of august   and us million as of august  including debt denominated in japanese yen valued at us million as of august   and us million as of august  
foreign currency receivables and payables as of august   were comprised primarily of japanese yen  euros  singapore dollars and british pounds 
the company estimates that  based on its assets and liabilities denominated in japanese yen as of august   a one yen change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately million
