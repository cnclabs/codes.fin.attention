our actual growth  results  performance and business prospects and opportunities in and beyond could differ materially from what is expressed in  or implied by  any such forward looking statements 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
background and overview we are a provider of private  for profit postsecondary education with campuses throughout the united states  canada  france  the united kingdom and the united arab emirates 
we also offer online programs through american intercontinental university online  our e learning division 
including the impact of our february   acquisition of the inseec group  our total student population as of january   would have been approximately  students 
our schools enjoy long operating histories and offer a variety of master s degree  bachelor s degree  associate degree  and diploma programs in career oriented disciplines within our core curricula of visual communication and design technologies information technology business studies culinary arts health education we have invested significant amounts of capital in the hiring of additional personnel and increased marketing and capital improvements at each of the schools we have acquired 
the increased costs of personnel and marketing are expensed as incurred and are reflected in general and administrative expenses 
additional depreciation expense is a result of capital improvements 
increased amortization expense during and is a result of additional goodwill recorded in connection with and acquisitions 
decreased amortization expense during is primarily a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization in connection with our january  adoption of statement of accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas 
we have experienced significant growth both internally and through acquisitions with our net revenue increasing from million in to million in in addition  our net income has increased from million in to million in in addition  we believe that earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  while not a substitute for generally accepted accounting principles measures of operating results  is an important measure of our financial performance and that of our schools 
for the year ended december   ebitda was million  a percent increase from ebitda of million for the year ended december  we believe that ebitda is particularly meaningful due principally to the role acquisitions have played in our development 
historically  our rapid growth through acquisitions has resulted in significant non cash depreciation and amortization expense  because a significant portion of the purchase price of a school acquired by us is generally allocated to fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
however  as a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization expense in connection with our january   adoption of sfas  amortization expense decreased significantly in our principal source of revenue is tuition collected from our students 
the academic year is at least weeks in length but varies both by individual school and program of study 
the academic year is divided by term  which is determined by start dates  which vary by school and program 
payment of each term s tuition may be made by full cash payment  financial aid and or an installment payment plan 
if a student withdraws from school prior to the completion of the term  we refund the portion of tuition already paid which is attributable to the period of the term that is not completed 
tuition revenue and one time fees  such as application fees  are recognized on a straight line basis over the length of the applicable program and are reflected net of bad debt expense 
the portion of tuition payments received but not earned is recorded as deferred revenue 
our campuses charge tuition at varying amounts  depending not only on the particular school but also upon the type of program and the specific curriculum 
on average  our campuses increase tuition one or more times annually 
other revenue consists primarily of bookstore sales  dormitory revenue  student laptop computer sales  placement revenue  contract training revenue  rental income  cafeteria revenue  and restaurant revenue 
other dormitory and cafeteria revenues are recognized upon delivery 
other student laptop computer sales  bookstore sales  placement revenue  restaurant revenue  rental income  and contract training revenue are recognized as services are performed or goods are delivered 
educational services and facilities expense includes costs directly attributable to the educational activity of our schools  including salaries and benefits of faculty  academic administrators and student support personnel 
educational services and facilities expense also includes costs of educational supplies and facilities  including rents on school leases  distance learning costs  certain costs of establishing and maintaining computer laboratories  costs of student housing and owned facility costs 
general and administrative expense includes salaries and benefits of personnel in recruitment  admissions  accounting  personnel  compliance and corporate and school administration 
costs of promotion and development  advertising and production of marketing materials  and occupancy of the corporate offices are also included in this expense category 
depreciation expense includes costs associated with the depreciation of  among other things  purchased computer laboratories  equipment  furniture and fixtures  courseware  owned facilities  capitalized equipment leases 
depreciation is recognized using the straight line method over the useful lives or lease terms of the related assets for financial reporting purposes and an accelerated method for income tax purposes 
amortization expense includes the amortization of intangible assets 
through december   goodwill related to each acquisition completed before june   was amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  and goodwill related to each acquisition completed after june   was not amortized  in accordance with sfas beginning january   pursuant to our january   adoption of sfas  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization 
however  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment by applying a fair value based test on at least an annual basis 
acquisitions all of our acquisitions to date were accounted for as purchases

we are currently in the process of allocating the purchase price to the fair market values of acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities as of february  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  the recoverability of long lived assets  accrued liabilities  contractual obligations  revenue recognition and contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  assessment of current conditions  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and are not readily apparent from other sources 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments by management and uncertainties  and that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
although  historically  actual results have not deviated significantly from those determined using management s estimates  as discussed below  our consolidated financial position or results of operations could be materially different if we were to report under different conditions or using different assumptions in the application of our critical accounting policies 
we believe that the following accounting policies are most critical to us  in that they represent the primary areas where financial information is subject to the application of management s estimates  assumptions and judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies discussed herein are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in the application of such principles 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result from the result derived from the application of our critical accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition revenue is derived primarily from programs taught at our schools 
tuition revenue and one time fees  such as application fees  are recognized on a straight line basis over the length of the applicable program 
dormitory and cafeteria revenues charged to students are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of a student s dormitory and cafeteria use 
other dormitory and cafeteria revenues are recognized upon delivery 
other revenue  such as student laptop computer sales  bookstore sales  placement revenue  restaurant revenue  rental income and contract training revenue  is recognized as services are performed or goods are delivered 
revenue is reflected net of bad debt expense of approximately million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the portion of payments received but not earned is recorded as deferred revenue and reflected as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheets  as such amount represents revenue that we expect to earn within the next year 
refunds are calculated and paid in accordance with applicable federal  state and accrediting agency standards and company policy 
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon past experience and judgment  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to tuition receivables 
in establishing our allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider  among other things  a student s status in school or out of school  whether or not additional financial aid funding will be collected from title iv programs or other sources  whether or not a student is currently making payments  and overall collections history 
changes in trends in any of these areas may impact the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the receivable balances of withdrawn students with delinquent obligations are fully reserved in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical bad debt expense as a percentage of gross school revenue for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from title iv programs  any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under title iv programs or the ability of our students or schools to participate in title iv programs could have a material effect on the realizability of our receivables 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill related to each acquisition completed before june   has been amortized through december   on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
goodwill related to acquisitions completed after june   has not been amortized  as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
effective january   pursuant to our adoption of sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization 
however  these assets are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
during the second quarter of  we completed the transitional intangible asset impairment test required under sfas and  based on the results of the test  concluded that no impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets had occurred 
therefore  no impairment loss was recorded in connection with our adoption of sfas in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under sfas if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line or accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives 
recoverability of long lived assets on an ongoing basis  we review property and equipment  definite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
to date  no such events or changes in circumstances have occurred 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  we will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or acquired business are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of such assets 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes based upon the tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the expected future tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carry forwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates or future taxable income levels could materially impact the our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated

net tuition and registration fee revenue increased million or  from million in to million in the increase was due primarily to a million or percentage point improvement in net tuition and registration fee revenue on a same school basis ie  schools acquired or opened on or prior to january  
this same school revenue increase was attributable to an approximate percentage point increase in the average student population during at the schools we acquired or opened on or prior to january   and an approximate percentage point revenue increase associated with tuition price increases and a shift in student enrollment mix toward higher priced programs 
the remainder of the increase in net tuition and registration fee revenue was due to additional revenue of million generated by schools acquired or opened after january  tca  pci  orlando culinary academy  brooks college sunnyvale  ca and missouri college 
this additional revenue accounted for percentage points of the total percentage point increase in net tuition and registration fee revenue during bad debt expense increased million or  from million in to million in  and bad debt expense as a percentage of gross school revenue increased from during to during this anticipated increase in bad debt expense as a percentage of gross school revenue is primarily attributable to a greater number of students taking higher priced programs  which results in lower government funding for students as a percentage of cash receipts 
this requires many of our students to enter into payment arrangements with larger monthly payments and balances due that may extend beyond their scheduled graduation dates 
in addition  a higher rate of attrition caused a larger portion of our receivables to be due from students who did not complete their programs 
these students represent a poorer credit risk than do those who complete their programs 
other net revenue increased million or  from million in to million in this increase is attributable to an approximate million or percentage point improvement in other net revenue on a same school basis  caused primarily by the increase in student population mentioned above  and additional other revenue of million generated by schools acquired or opened after january  the disproportionate growth of other revenue relative to net tuition and registration fee revenue growth was primarily a result of a higher concentration of other net revenue at our newly acquired schools

this additional revenue accounted for percentage points of the total percentage point increase in net tuition and registration fee revenue during bad debt expense increased million or  from million in to million in  and bad debt expense as a percentage of gross revenue increased from during to during we estimate that a significant portion of this increase in bad debt expense as a percentage of gross revenue was attributable to the implementation of the doe s return of title iv funds policy

net income 
net income increased million or  from million in to million in  as a cumulative result of the factors discussed above 
seasonality our results of operations fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in the level of student enrollment at our schools 
our schools experience a seasonal increase in new enrollments in the fall  traditionally when the largest number of new high school graduates begins postsecondary education 
furthermore  although we encourage year round attendance at all schools  some schools have summer breaks for some of their programs 
as a result of these factors  total student enrollment and net revenue are typically highest in the fourth quarter october through december and lowest in the second quarter april through june 
however  our costs and expenses do not fluctuate as significantly on a quarterly basis  except for admissions and advertising costs  as these are typically higher in the second and third quarter in support of seasonally high enrollments 
we anticipate that these seasonal trends will continue

our domestic subsidiaries  jointly and severally  have guaranteed repayment of obligations under the credit agreement 
under the credit agreement  we are limited in our ability to take certain actions  including  among other things  consummating acquisitions or mergers  paying cash dividends  selling or disposing of certain assets or subsidiaries  incurring other debt in excess of specified amounts  prepaying other debt  and making certain investments 
we are also required to satisfy certain financial covenants on a periodic basis  including the maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of during the current period  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of  a minimum level of consolidated net worth  and a minimum annual consolidated department of education financial responsibility composite score of 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of our credit agreement 
we rent most of our facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through we also finance the acquisition of certain equipment through capital lease agreements 
at december   the principal balance of outstanding capital lease obligations was approximately million 
in  we recorded a million liability representing our preliminary estimate of the present value of payments due  beginning in  under a pre existing long term contractual obligation for which we will receive no future benefit 
during  we recorded a purchase accounting adjustment of million and interest accretion of million to increase the total reserve to million 
as of december   future minimum cash payments due under contractual obligations  including our credit agreement  non cancelable operating and capital lease agreements and other arrangements  are as follows in thousands thereafter total revolving loans   capital lease obligations   other long term debt operating lease obligations     other long term obligations  total contractual cash obligations    the doe requires that we keep unbilled title iv program funds that are collected in separate cash accounts until the students are billed for the program portion related to those title iv program funds 
in addition  all funds transferred to our schools through electronic funds transfer program are held in a separate cash account until certain conditions are satisfied 
as of december   we held nominal amounts of such funds in separate accounts 
the restrictions on any cash held in these accounts have not significantly affected our ability to fund daily operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  to provide guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
sab outlines basic criteria that must be met before registrants may recognize revenue  including persuasive evidence of the existence of an arrangement  the delivery of products or services  a fixed and determinable sales price  and reasonable assurance of collection 
prior to the release of sab  our revenue recognition policy was in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles 
through december   we recognized application and registration fees as revenue upon receipt 
effective january   we adopted a change in accounting principle to comply with the specific provisions and guidance of sab as a result  we recognized a cumulative charge of million  net of taxes 
sab requires us to recognize revenue related to application and registration fees over the program period 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and that the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of acquired intangible assets apart from goodwill 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization over their estimated useful life 
rather  these assets are subject to  at least  an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
effective january   we adopted a change in accounting principle to comply with the specific provisions and guidance of sfas and sfas our adoption of sfas resulted in a million decrease in amortization expense and a million increase in net income during during the second quarter of  we completed the transitional intangible asset impairment test required under sfas and  based on the results of the test  concluded that no impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets had occurred 
therefore  no impairment loss was recorded in connection with our adoption of sfas in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas supercedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of sfas and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas also retains the requirement under apb to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
our january   adoption of sfas has not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with disposal activities sfas 
under sfas  liabilities for costs associated with a plan to dispose of an asset or to exit a business activity must be recognized in the period in which the costs are incurred 
sfas is effective for disposal activities initiated after december  we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas amends sfas and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas is effective for financial statements for annual periods ending after december  and interim periods beginning after december  we have adopted the amendments to sfas disclosure provisions required under sfas but will continue to use intrinsic value method under opinion to account for stock based compensation 
as such  our adoption of this statement has not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation 
interpretation requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if the company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns 
the interpretation also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
interpretation is immediately effective for variable interest entities created after january   and effective june   with respect to variable interest entities created on or prior to january  we do not believe that the adoption of this interpretation will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
risks related to our business the following risks  uncertainties and other factors could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  operating results and growth prospects 
failure to comply with extensive regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business failure of our us schools to comply with extensive regulations could result in financial penalties  restrictions on our operations or loss of external financial aid funding 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from us federal student financial aid programs administered by the us department of education 
to participate in these programs  a us institution must obtain and maintain authorization by the appropriate state agencies  accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the department of education  and certification by the department of education 
as a result  our us schools are subject to extensive regulation by these agencies 
these regulations cover virtually all phases of our operations  including our educational programs  facilities  instructional and administrative staff  administrative procedures  marketing and recruiting  financial operations  including the payment of refunds to students who withdraw  and financial strength 
they also affect our ability to acquire or open additional schools  add new educational programs or change our corporate structure 
these regulatory agencies periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements 
if one of our schools were to violate any of these regulatory requirements  we could suffer a financial penalty 
a regulatory agency could also place limitations on our schools operations or terminate the schools ability to grant degrees and certificates or their eligibility to receive federal student financial aid funds 
we cannot predict with certainty how all of these requirements will be applied  or whether each of our schools will be able to comply with all of the requirements in the future 
some of the most significant regulatory requirements and risks that apply to our us schools are described in the following paragraphs 
please also see business financial aid and regulation for more detailed information on the regulations and other requirements that apply to us 
the us congress may change the law or reduce funding for federal student financial aid programs  which could harm our business 
the us congress periodically revises the higher education act and other laws governing the federal student financial aid programs and annually determines the funding level for each of these programs 
during  congress is expected to devote significant attention to reauthorizing the higher education act  which will likely result in numerous legislative changes 
any action by congress that significantly reduces funding for the federal student financial aid programs or the ability of our schools or students to participate in these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 
legislative action may also increase our administrative costs and require us to modify our practices in order for our schools to comply fully with applicable requirements 
if we or our schools do not meet financial responsibility standards  our schools may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs  which could harm our business 
to participate in the federal student financial aid programs  an institution must either meet specific numeric measures of financial responsibility or post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in the federal student financial aid programs 
currently  none of our schools is required to post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education or accept other conditions on its participation in the federal student financial aid programs due to failure to satisfy the numeric measures of financial responsibility 
we or our institutions may not satisfy the numeric standards in the future 
under a separate requirement  an institution must post a letter of credit if it makes more than a certain proportion of student refunds beyond the regulatory time period 
twenty one of our institutions have outstanding letters of credit in favor of the department of education in the amount of million due to late student refunds 
our schools may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if their student loan default rates are too high 
an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the federal student financial aid programs if defaults by its students on their federal student loans exceed specified rates 
if any of our institutions  depending on its size  loses eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs because of high student loan default rates  that loss could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our schools may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of their revenue derived from those programs is too high 
a proprietary institution loses its eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs if it derives more than of its revenue from these programs in any fiscal year 
if any of our institutions  depending on its size  loses eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs  that loss could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if regulators do not approve our acquisition of schools from third parties  our ability to participate in federal student financial aid programs at the acquired institution would be limited 
when we acquire an institution  the department of education and most applicable state agencies and accrediting agencies consider that a change of ownership or control of the institution has occurred 
a change of ownership or control of an institution under the standards of the department of education may result in the temporary suspension of the institution s participation in the federal student financial aid programs until the department of education issues a temporary certification document 
if we were unable to promptly reestablish the state authorization  accreditation or department of education certification of an institution we acquired  depending on the size of that acquisition  that failure could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if regulators do not approve transactions involving a change of control or change in our corporate structure  we may lose our ability to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
if we experience a change of control under the standards of applicable state agencies  accrediting agencies or the department of education  we or the schools governed by such agencies must seek the approval of the relevant agencies 
the failure of any of our schools to reestablish its state authorization  accreditation or department of education certification would result in a suspension or loss of federal student financial aid funding  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the department of education  applicable state agencies or applicable accrediting agencies may consider other transactions or events to constitute a change of control 
some of these transactions or events  such as a significant acquisition of our common stock  may be beyond our control 
if our schools do not maintain their state authorizations and accreditations  they may not operate or participate in federal student financial aid programs 
a school that grants degrees  diplomas or certificates must be authorized by the relevant agencies of the state in which it is located and  in some cases  other states where the school is deemed to be operating 
state authorization and accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the department of education are also required for an institution to participate in the federal student financial aid programs 
requirements for authorization or accreditation vary substantially among the applicable agencies  and some of our schools must satisfy highly detailed standards regarding their educational programs  facilities  faculty and other matters to maintain the necessary approvals 
loss of state authorization or accreditation by any of our campuses  depending on the size of the campus  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
regulatory agencies or third parties may commence compliance reviews  bring claims or initiate litigation against us 
because we operate in a highly regulated industry  we are subject to compliance reviews  claims of non compliance or lawsuits by government agencies or third parties 
if the results of such reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us or if we are unable successfully to defend against third party lawsuits or claims  we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines  limitations  loss of federal funding  injunctions or other penalties 
even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a third party lawsuit or claim  we may have to devote significant money and management resources to address these issues  which could harm our business 
failure to comply with extensive canadian regulations could affect the ability of our canadian schools to participate in canadian financial aid programs 
we derive a majority of our canadian schools revenue from canadian governmental financial aid programs 
depending on their province of residence  canadian students may receive loans under the canada student loans program  the ontario student loans plan and the quebec loans and bursaries program 
there are students attending the canadian schools who receive government sponsored financial assistance from provinces other than ontario and quebec 
our canadian schools must meet eligibility standards to administer these programs and must comply with extensive statutes  rules  regulations and requirements 
each of our ontario schools will be required to share the cost of student loan defaults if defaults by its students on their ontario student assistance plan loans exceed specified rates 
our international academy of design and technology and softtrain schools in toronto currently do not have a default rate that exceeds the applicable threshold of 
however  our international academy of design and technology school in ottawa had an overall default rate of in and has received a letter from the ontario ministry of training  colleges and universities indicating that it may have to share in the costs of defaults and post an additional bond with the ministry 
if our canadian schools cannot meet these and other eligibility standards or fail to comply with applicable requirements  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the canadian  ontario and quebec governments continuously review the legislative  regulatory and other requirements relating to student financial assistance programs due to political and budgetary pressures 
although we do not anticipate a significant reduction in the funding for these programs  any change that significantly reduces funding or the ability of our schools to participate in these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks specific to our business could have a material adverse effect on us failure to effectively manage our growth could harm our business 
we have grown rapidly since our incorporation in january our rapid growth may place a strain on our management  operations  employees or resources 
we may not be able to maintain or accelerate our current growth rate  effectively manage our expanding operations or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if students fail to pay their outstanding balances  our business will be harmed 
we offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expense not covered by financial aid programs 
these balances are unsecured and not guaranteed 
losses related to unpaid student balances in excess of the amounts we have reserved for bad debts could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to effectively identify  pursue and integrate acquired schools could harm our business 
we expect to continue to rely on acquisitions as a key component of our growth 
from time to time  we engage in  and we are currently engaged in  evaluations of  and discussions with  possible acquisition candidates 
we may not continue to be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or to acquire any such schools on favorable terms 
furthermore  we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired schools into our operations profitably 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks and challenges  including the diversion of management s attention  difficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired schools  adverse short term effects on reported operating results  possible loss of key employees and difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image 
continued growth through acquisition may also subject us to unanticipated business or regulatory uncertainties or liabilities 
acquired schools may not enhance our business and may ultimately have a material adverse effect on us 
opening additional new schools and adding new services could be difficult for us 
we have also grown by opening new schools  primarily as additional branches of existing schools 
establishing new schools poses unique challenges and requires us to make investments in management  capital expenditures  marketing expenses and other resources different  and in some cases greater  than those required with respect to the operation of acquired schools 
when opening a new school  we may be required to obtain appropriate state or provincial and accrediting agency approvals 
in addition  to be eligible for federal student financial aid programs  such a school has to be certified by the department of education 
our failure to effectively manage the operations of newly established schools or service areas  or any diversion of management s attention from our core career oriented school operating activities  could harm our business 
failure to keep pace with changing market needs and technology could harm our business 
prospective employers of our graduates increasingly demand that their entry level employees possess appropriate technological skills 
educational programs at our schools  particularly programs in visual communications and information technology  must keep pace with these evolving requirements 
if we cannot respond to changes in industry requirements  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract students 
competitors with greater resources could harm our business 
the postsecondary education market is highly competitive 
our schools compete with traditional public and private two year and four year colleges and universities and other proprietary schools  including those that offer distance learning programs 
some public and private colleges and universities  as well as other private career oriented schools  offer programs similar to those of our schools 
although tuition at private nonprofit institutions is  on average  higher than tuition at our schools  some public institutions are able to charge lower tuition than our schools  due in part to government subsidies and other financial sources not available to proprietary schools 
some of our competitors in both the public and private sectors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
expansion outside of the us  canada  france  the united kingdom and dubai could adversely affect our business 
although we currently operate in the us  canada  france  the united kingdom and dubai  we intend to explore opportunities outside those markets 
there may be difficulties and complexities associated with our expansion into these other international markets  and our strategies may not succeed beyond our current markets 
international operations present inherent risks  including currency fluctuations  varying political and economic conditions  unanticipated changes in regulation  trade barriers  staffing and management problems and adverse tax consequences 
also  in further expanding internationally  we would be required to comply with different  and potentially more onerous  regulatory requirements 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to obtain additional capital in the future could reduce our ability to grow 
we believe that funds from operations  cash  investments and borrowings under our million credit facility pursuant to our credit agreement will be adequate to fund our current operating plans for the foreseeable future 
however  we may need additional debt or equity financing in order to carry out our strategy of growth through acquisitions 
we may also need additional debt or equity financing in the future to carry out our growth strategy 
the amount and timing of such additional financing will vary principally depending on the timing and size of acquisitions and the sellers willingness to provide financing themselves 
to the extent that we require additional financing in the future and are unable to obtain such additional financing  we may not be able to fully implement our growth strategy 
our credit agreement limits our ability to take various actions 
our credit agreement limits our ability to take various actions  including paying dividends and disposing of assets 
accordingly  we may be restricted from taking actions which management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders 
the credit agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy specified financial tests 
a breach of any covenants contained in the credit agreement could result in an event of default under that agreement and allow the lenders to pursue various remedies  including accelerating the indebtedness outstanding thereunder  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
the loss of our key personnel could harm our business 
our success to date has depended  and will continue to depend  largely on the skills and efforts of john m 
larson  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  patrick k 
pesch  our executive vice president  chief financial officer  treasurer and secretary  nick fluge  president of our online education group and jacob p 
gruver  president of our colleges  schools universities group and our other key personnel 
our success also depends  in large part  upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified faculty  school presidents and administrators and corporate management 
due to the nature of our business  we may have difficulty locating and hiring qualified personnel  and retaining such personnel once hired 
none of our employees is subject to an employment or noncompetition agreement other than mr 
larson 
we do not maintain life insurance on any of our employees 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  a limited number of our faculty members are represented by unions  although they are not currently subject to collective bargaining agreements 
if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements  our flexibility in making human resources decisions could be impaired 
terrorist attacks and other acts of wider armed conflict may have an adverse effect on the us and world economies and may disrupt our provision of educational services 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war  such as those that took place on september   could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or its businesses or interests 
attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact our physical facilities or ability to recruit foreign students could significantly affect our ability to provide educational services to our students and thereby impair our ability to achieve our expected results 
further  the adverse effects that such violent acts and threats of future attacks could have on the us and world economies could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
finally  further terrorist acts could cause the united states to enter into a wider armed conflict which could further impact our operations and result in prospective students  as well as our current students and employees  entering the armed forces 
these factors could cause significant declines in our enrollment and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law and our stockholders rights plan could make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our by laws contain provisions that may delay  defer or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of directors 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in connection with the transaction 
for example  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock with such voting  conversion and other rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions as it determines  without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation divides our board of directors into three classes having staggered terms 
we are also subject to the provisions of delaware law that could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of our company 
one of these provisions prevents us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person becomes an interested stockholder  unless specified conditions are satisfied 
we have also implemented a stockholders rights plan  also commonly called a poison pill  that would substantially reduce or eliminate the expected economic benefit to an acquirer from acquiring us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors 
these and other impediments to a third party acquisition or change of control could limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
risks specific to our aiu online s business could have a material adverse effect on our business 
aiu online intends to continue increasing the number of its students and more resources will be required to support this anticipated growth  including additional faculty  and enrollment  academic and financial counselors 
this exceptional growth has placed  and future growth is expected to place  a significant strain on aiu online s operational resources 
the continued development of awareness of the programs offered by aiu online is critical to the continued acceptance and growth of aiu online s programs 
if aiu online is unable to continue to develop awareness of the programs offered by it  this could limit its enrollments and negatively impact its ability to increase revenues and profitability 
aiu online s success depends in part on its ability to expand the content of its programs  develop new programs in a cost effective manner  and meet its students needs in a timely manner 
the expansion of aiu online s existing programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by its students or the online education market 
the performance and reliability of aiu online s program infrastructure is critical to the reputation of aiu online and its ability to attract and retain students 
any system error or failure  or a sudden and significant increase in traffic  may result in the unavailability of aiu online s computer networks 
individual  sustained  or repeated occurrences could significantly damage the reputation of aiu online and result in a loss of potential or existing students 
additionally  aiu online s computer systems and operations are vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond its control  including natural disasters and telecommunications failures 
any interruption to aiu online s computer systems or operations could have a material adverse effect on the ability of aiu online to attract and retain students 
aiu online s computer networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer hackers  computer viruses  and other security problems 
a user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations 
due to the sensitive nature of the information contained on aiu online s networks  such as students grades  its networks may be targeted by hackers 
as a result  aiu online may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
we have not entered into interest rate caps or collars or other hedging instruments
