overview ecollege is a leading provider of technology and services that enable colleges  universities  k schools  and corporations to offer an online environment for distance  on campus and hybrid learning 
our technology enables our customers to reach a large number of students who wish to take courses at convenient times and locations via the internet 
our customers can also use our technology to supplement their on campus courses with an online learning environment 
additionally  we offer services to assist in the development of online programs  including online course and campus design  development  management and hosting  as well as ongoing administration  faculty  and student support  training  evaluation and consulting services 
our primary source of revenue is through student technology service fees we charge to our customers for each student enrolled in a distance education course delivered on our course management platform 
our customers typically guarantee a minimum amount of stud ent technology service fees for each year they are under contract with us  and benefit from volume discounts based on the success of their distance programs 
we were founded and began delivering our products and services in as of december   we had customers under contract 
since our inception  our customers have had approximately  student enrollments in online courses or course supplements and have purchased or ordered more than  unique online courses and course supplements 
of those courses and course supplements  we ve provided course development services for  unique online courses and received applicable fees from our customers 
our objectives are to continue to expand our presence within our target market of colleges  universities and k schools in the united states and canada that offer online distance education and to add international customers as the potential arises 
the key elements of our growth strategy are to increase online programs  course offerings and enrollments with existing customers  add additional colleges and universities from our target market  increase on campus adoptions to solidify and grow distance education relationships  and add additional k customers and evaluate international opportunities as they arise 
one key metric that we use to measure our success as well as our data center capacity is the number of students our customers have enrolled in online courses and course supplements delivered on our course management system 
since our customers offer traditional  as well as quarterly  bi monthly and monthly course terms to their students  we typically host more courses during the spring academic term than in the summer or fall terms 
as a result  consecutive academic term enrollment results are not directly comparable 
the following table presents the number of student enrollments our customers had in online courses and our lower priced course supplements during the  and academic terms 
distance course enrollments on campus course supplement enrollments total student enrollments academic term spring january may summer may august fall august december total student enrollments our top customers in averaged a increase in their distance course enrollments during the student fee revenue we earned from those same customers grew at a rate of in due primarily to volume discounts on pricing 
as a result of our growth strategy to increase adoption of our cms by offering our on campus products and services at significantly reduced prices  the number of students enrolled in on campus course supplements increased  but the amount of revenue recognized from such enrollments actually decreased during the number of customers for which we provide development  licensing and hosting services of their online campuses increased by approximately during and during however  the number of orders for new online courses to be developed by our professionals decreased by approximately in and in there were  new ecourses developed on our platform in  of which were developed by our professio nals 
this compares to  and  respectively in as we look at these important trends in our business  we expect to see continued growth in revenue in  but we expect that a greater percentage of that growth will be driven by the growth in student fee revenue as our other service line revenue remains stable  based on the following factors we expect our customers distance student enrollments for the spring term to be greater than in the spring term and we also believe our customers student enrollments will grow substantially during the remainder of however  our pricing provides discounts to our customers as their programs grow 
therefore  although we expect our student fee revenue to show a strong increase  the increase will likely not be directly proportional to the anticipated increase in student enrollments  we expect to see our course development revenue continue to decrease as more customers elect to self develop courses 
while we continue to introduce new course development services  we do not expect these to completely offset the decrease in our traditional course development service revenue  and we expect our campus fee revenue will remain flat during and we expect to see a moderate increase in our revenue from other services  such as our technology consulting  instructional design consulting and evaluation service lines 
this increase should offset the expected decrease in course development revenue 
therefore  we are expecting revenue growth of for and expect revenue to accelerate over the year based on historical seasonal patterns and the anticipated growth of our customer s online programs 
we also expect total expenses to be flat to a slight increase from and therefore we expect positive net income for the year based on generally accepted accounting principles  although there can be no guarantee thereof 
we have invested in our service capabilities by expanding our infrastructure to accommodate our current and future customer needs 
our expenditures have exceeded our revenue since our inception and our accumulated losses have increased as a result of our growth strategy 
any future increases in our cost of revenue should be significantly less than any increases in our revenue 
we expect to see gross profits improve as revenue from student fees increase and we utilize existing capacity in our data center 
we expect our operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the future  as we utilize our resources efficiently to support anticipated revenue growth 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition  accounting for software development costs  stock based compensation and income taxes are all critical accounting policies for our company 
these policies have been discussed with  and continually evaluated by  our board of directors audit committee and independent auditors and are consistent with the policies in effect during each of the policies is discussed in detail in the following section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue since inception  we have primarily generated revenue from three sources enrollment fees for students enrolled in online courses and online course supplements  design and development  licensing and hosting services fees for online campuses  and design and development services fees to build online courses 
our other revenue sources have primarily been professional consulting and research grant activities 
the success of our business model is based upon a number of factors  including increasing online learning among colleges  universities  and k schools  adding new customers  adding new programs and developing additional courses for our existing customers  and selling new products and services to our customers 
although no one customer accounted for or more of our revenue during  our top customers accounted for of our total revenue 
the loss of one or more of these customers without the addition of comparable new customers could have an impact on our ability to sustain our revenue growth 
one of our largest customers has notified us that it does not intend to renew its guaranteed minimum contract with us when it expires in april we expect this customer to generate approximately of our revenue in  however  we believe that we will be able to sustain our revenue growth in and based on the addition of new customers and the expected growth from our other existing customers 
from our inception through december   the majority of our revenue was generated by development and design services fees for building online campuses and courses  and  to a lesser extent  student enrollment fees 
campus and course revenue continued to grow in  and  however  student fees have become a majority of total revenue as the number of online courses offered by our customers and the number of students enrolled in those courses delivered on our course management platform continue to increase at an even greater pace 
we expect this trend in our revenue mix to continue 
further  during  our course development fees declined as our customers developed more courses on their own using our proprietary tools 
while this negatively impacted our course development revenue  we believe it has positively impacted the higher margin student fee revenue due to the availability of more online courses conducted by our customers on the ecollege system 
as our pricing and prod uct mix change  and as our customers online programs grow and mature  we anticipate that student enrollments will increase  with resulting increases in student fee revenue 
however  due to volume discounts that we offer and competitive pricing in our industry  we expect that the increases in student fee revenue will likely not be directly proportional to the anticipated increases in student enrollments 
in order to enhance our current customer relationships and further penetrate the distance education market  we feel it is important to develop a greater presence in the lower margin  on campus market for key customers 
we have begun offering a pricing scenario that is designed to make our offerings more attractive for both on campus and distance education programs 
it will also encourage further familiarity of our cms with faculty that may wish to teach online 
we have begun offering our on campus product and service offerings at significantly reduced prices for customers who demonstrate a commitment to building or maintaining a large distance education program 
as evidenced by the growth in our enrollments in on campus course supplements in from  some customers have adopted our platform as their on campus online learning solution in addition to their distance education learning solution 
our core online products include teaching solutions and program administrative solutions 
teaching solutions includes ecourse  an online version of a traditional classroom course delivered to students who might not otherwise have access to the course  and ecompanion  an online teaching supplement designed to enhance classroom based courses 
we also offer a suite of services and products designed to assist our customers in creating and delivering high quality online programs 
as part of our teaching solutions  we partner with leading textbook and new media publishers to provide educators and students academically focused content resources 
program administrative solutions  consisting of gateway campus and campusportal  offer online community  academic and administrative functions similar to a physical college campus while incorporating the customer s unique look and feel 
these online campuses allow a customer to access and manage online courses and supplements  and provide access to the on line community and organizations 
program administrative solutions also includes program consulting  delivery and operational support services  and our evaluation solutions  which are comprehensive internet based products that automate the entire course and instructor evaluation process we enter into non exclusive contracts with our customers to provide our online learning products and services 
our contracts typically have initial terms of one to five years  with the average being approximately three years 
each contract specifies the type and price of the online campus purchased and the number and price of online courses purchased  as well as the fees for student enrollments and any other services purchased 
since our customer contracts are generally applicable campus wide  colleges and universities can add new online programs and schools without the need to negotiate new contract terms 
the majority of our revenue is earned by charging a per enrollment student technology service fee to our customers for access to their ecourses  and our help desk 
we also offer a pricing model for our ecompanion product under which we charge an annual license fee 
for our program administrative solutions  we generally charge a one time set up and design fee to implement an online campus  and an annual license  hosting and maintenance fee for access to our software 
historically  we have sold our course development services on a per course basis while our other professional consulting services were based on our standard hourly rates 
in  we began offering our customers the option to purchase blocks of course development service hours  based on our standard hourly rates 
during we expanded and improved our teaching solutions and program administrative solutions product lines  including the release of the next generation of our cms  ecollege au 
ecollege au increased the efficiency of assignment management  introduced new capabilities for content authoring  and integrated all course calendars into a single downloadable calendar 
we also added more robust self authoring tools to our course management system in the past two years which are designed to allow customers to easily develop their own online courses without needing html or other programming knowledge 
in addition  we launched our publisher toolkit sm in  providing publishers with an infrastructure to deliver their content online as well as personal identification number pin technology  and end user support 
finally  we have begun an open platform initiative for easier integration with other applications  such as off line exam authoring capabilities and student information s ystems or other administrative back office data sources 
in october  we were awarded a grant by the national institute of standards and technology nist  a department of the us department of commerce 
we were entitled to receive payments under the grant as research was performed related to automated course content creation and organization  and tutoring delivery systems 
this revenue was recognized as we or our subcontractors performed the work 
the grant expired in january  however  we were granted an extension until april to complete the necessary documentation of our research 
through december   we had applied for and received payments totaling approximately  the maximum available under the nist grant 
we recognized  of revenue relating to the nist grant from its inception through december  the remaining receipts from the grant represent cost reimbursements for equipment purchased in connection with the nist research 
in october  we received a letter from the us department of co mmerce requesting additional support for a portion of the expenditures reimbursed under the grant 
we subsequently provided the appropriate additional information 
we believe that we have performed our work in full compliance with the terms of the nist grant  and that a favorable audit resolution determination letter will be issued by nist 
if we receive an adverse audit resolution determination letter  we could be required to reimburse nist for disallowed expenditures  and such amount of reimbursement could be material 
revenue recognition revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy for our company  as it primarily affects the timing of when we recognize the fees we charge our customers for our services 
student fees are recognized on a straight line basis over each course s specific academic term or over the length of the student fee license purchased by the customer  depending upon contract terms 
campus license  hosting and maintenance fees  including the design and development of a customer s campus  are recognized on a straight line basis from the campus launch date through the end of the relevant contract period or the expected life of the customer relationship  whichever is greater 
the average recognition period for these campus fees is approximately three years 
course development fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the approximate period over which our services are provided and our obligation to the customer is fulfilled 
during and prior periods  this performance period for course development services was estimated to be twelve months from the date the course was ordered by the customer 
effective january   we began to recognize such fees over a nine month recognition period  based upon changes in our experience of providing such services 
we believe that this change more accurately reflects the period over which the services are currently delivered 
the period over which we perform the services and therefore recognize the revenue may change in the future as our actual experience in completing development obligations continues to evolve 
changes in our contract terms and expected customer life may also affect the period over which campus and course development fees are recognized in the future 
all other revenue sources are recognized over the period of the performance of the service eg  instructional design and technical consulting or over the length of the service period eg  annual evaluation solutions license fees 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of employee compensation and benefits for our account management  online campus development  course design  technical personnel  and help desk departments as well as sales commissions 
our cost of revenue also includes software  hardware  and other direct costs associated with maintaining our data center operations  our web servers and our network infrastructure 
non marketing related costs of our grant program  as discussed below  are also included in cost of revenue 
amortization of capitalized software development costs is also included in our cost of revenue 
we also allocate a portion of our occupancy and infrastructure costs to cost of revenue 
sales commissions are recorded as revenue is recognized  but are generally paid after we have received an initial payment from the customer 
sales representatives also receive additional commissions for achieving significant goals such as signing large customers and increasing program offerings within current customers 
these additional commissions are recorded upon contract signing 
accounting for software development costs is a critical accounting policy for our company 
the determination of the point at which capitalization of qualifying costs properly commences is subject to a high degree of management judgement 
on april   we started to capitalize software development costs related to our campusportal product 
the technology developed for this product serves as the infrastructure to our campus and course management systems  thereby supporting our student technology service fee line 
as of march   we had capitalized  of costs related to development of this product 
in april  the software was determined to be ready for its intended use  and accordingly  we began amortizing the capitalized costs over a useful life of three years 
we did not capitalize any additional software development costs during through december   we had recorded  of accumulated amortization  and therefore have  of capitalized softwa re development costs remaining to be amortized 
we anticipate that the remaining capitalized software development costs will be fully amortized as of march   unless a review of the asset indicates that the remaining capitalized costs are impaired and an earlier write down is appropriate 
amortization expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
we expect a decrease in cost of revenue of approximately  per quarter  beginning in april  assuming no additional software development costs are capitalized between now and then 
realization of the capitalized software development costs is dependent upon generating sufficient revenue from the related software products and services during the useful life of such capitalized software 
it is reasonably possible that a review of the recorded amount of capitalized software development costs in the future could indicate that they are impaired  and the amount of impairment could be significant 
additionally  the technology we use internally and to support our customers can be subject to significant changes as new technology and software products are introduced into the marketplace by others 
it is reasonably possible that a change in our technology strategy could result in a conclusion that all or a portion of the recorded balance is impaired 
we expect that our cost of revenue will continue to decline in the future as a percentage of revenue 
we anticipate experiencing this decline as we achieve operating efficiencies  because many of our costs do not increase as rapidly as our revenue 
specifically  we anticipate experiencing this decline as our revenue mix changes to be more heavily weighted towards student fees  which have a lower incremental cost than revenue derived from our other product and service offerings 
grant program we implemented a grant program in late designed to increase the market for distance education by assisting new and existing customers in increasing the quality and number of online courses they offer and the number of students pursuing online degrees 
seventy two grants were awarded  at our discretion  to institutions based on demonstrated commitment to a quality online degree program  the number of current and potential students  the college or university s unique approach to online learning and other factors 
the grant program was substantially complete at december  and we do not anticipate offering new grant awards 
funds granted consist of both educational support funds and marketing funds 
we originally granted approximately million  which consisted of million in educational support funds and million in marketing funds 
as grant contracts have been completed  a total of thousand of the original grant awards have been forfeited by the recipients 
since the inception of the grant program  we have recorded million in total expenses  including million in cost of revenue for educational support funds and million in sales and marketing for marketing funds 
the estimated remaining costs of revenue for educational support funds we have yet to record under the grant program are immaterial at december   and we do not expect to incur any additional marketing expense related to the grant program in the future 
pursuant to the terms of the grants  funds are paid to the grant recipients after they have provided evidence of payment for appropriate expenditures to third parties 
customer expenditures for our services are not reimbursable under terms of the grants 
educational support funds consist of faculty stipends to encourage the generation of re usable digital course content  hardware technology  and travel funds  and are considered contract costs 
educational support funds are paid only after the grant recipient has provided evidence that they have expended funds in compliance with the grant contract 
if estimated total contract costs  including direct and indirect costs to perform our obligations under the contract  as well as the appropriate educational support funds  are in excess of the revenue guaranteed under the related agreement  such excess is expensed in the quarter in which the excess is first identified 
we recognized such a loss of million and recorded the liability as a contract loss accrual in this contract loss was recorded as a component of cost of revenue in as we recognize course development revenue under the grant recipients contracts and recognize the cost of educational support funds and other contract costs  the contract loss accrual is reduced such that the gross margin related to this revenue is zero 
in addition  the contract loss accrual is increased or decreased periodically based upon our best estimate of the costs including educational support funds to be incurred on uncompleted contracts and the related guaranteed revenue 
these estimates may change and affect the reported amounts of the liability on the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period 
including the effect of reductions to the contract loss accrual for costs actually incurred on completed contracts  as well as the effect of reductions to the contract loss accrual for changes in our expectations with regard to the costs related to uncompleted contracts  we recorded a reduction of  to cost of revenue in related to educational support funds  and an increase of  and  to cost of revenue related to educational support funds in and  respectively 
marketing funds are reimbursed to grant recipients based on demonstration of payment to third parties for approved marketing activities which promote their online programs 
these expenses are recorded as marketing expenses in the consolidated statement of operations when we estimate they are incurred by the grant recipients 
since the grant program s inception  grant payments have totaled million for reimbursements of educational support funds and million for reimbursements of marketing funds 
the estimated remaining disbursements under the grant program for reimbursed educational support and marketing funds are approximately  and  respectively  for a total of  at december   all of which are expected to be paid during management continually evaluates the grants for compliance 
it is possible that there may be individual grants that do not require the company to reimburse the full grant award  and thus a portion of the accrued expenses may be reversed and the related liability reduced in future reporting periods 
gross margin as our product mix continues to change and diversify  we expect that the mix of our cost of revenue will change accordingly 
we have been able to achieve increases in our revenue without increasing our cost of revenue proportionally 
in  our revenue increased and our cost of revenue decreased 
we expect our cost of revenue to remain relatively stable in the future due to operating efficiencies  increased utilization of our current infrastructure and personnel  current excess capacity in our data centers  as well as the expiration of the grant program and related expenses 
because we expect our revenue to increase  we expect continued improvement in our gross margin 
product development product development includes costs of maintaining  developing and improving our software products 
these costs consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits  consulting fees  occupancy and depreciation expenses 
we expect our development costs to increase slightly in from the level incurred in  as we continue to develop new products to respond to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers 
product development costs in the future may be reduced by any software development costs which are capitalized in accordance with relevant accounting standards  although we did not capitalize any such costs in selling and marketing the principal components of our selling and marketing expenses are employee compensation and benefits  advertising  industry conferences  and travel 
other significant components include marketing collaterals and direct mailings  consulting fees  occupancy and depreciation expenses 
our grant program includes reimbursement of approved third party expenditures to grant recipients for marketing their online degree programs 
these funds are recorded as marketing expense as we estimate that the grant recipients incur them and we incur the obligation to reimburse them 
based on actual results of the completed contracts and our current expectation with regard to uncompleted contracts  we recorded a reduction of marketing expenses of  for the year ended december  resulting from decreases in our accrued grant marketing liabilities 
marketing expenses related to the company s grant program were  and  in and  respectively 
we do not expect to record any additional marketing expenses related to our grant program 
we expect an increase in total selling and marketing expenses in as we attempt to grow our customer base 
general and administrative our general and administrative departments include finance  legal  human resources  corporate facilities  internal technical network administration and support  management information systems  and executives 
employee compensation and benefits represent the most significant component of general and administrative expense 
other components include rent  depreciation  communications  professional and consulting fees  and stock based compensation 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will not change significantly in terms of absolute dollars for the year stock based compensation stock based compensation is a critical accounting policy for our company 
current generally accepted accounting principles provide two methods for accounting for employee stock option plans and other employee stock based compensation arrangements 
companies may recognize stock based compensation expense under the intrinsic value based method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations apb opinion no 
or under a fair value based method prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and related interpretations sfas no 

we account for our employee stock option plans and other employee stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of apb opinion no 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
as required by sfas no 
 we present pro forma disclosures of our net loss using the fair valued based a ccounting model  as shown below as well as in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
under apb opinion no 
 we generally do not record any stock based compensation expense for options granted to employees  provided the options have an exercise price equal to or above the market price of our common stock and the ultimate number of shares to be issued upon exercise are fixed on the day the option is granted 
under sfas no 
 we would determine the fair value of the options granted using the black scholes option pricing model  and would recognize the value as stock based compensation expense over the period the options vest 
the united states financial accounting standards board the fasb is currently reconsidering the generally accepted accounting principles for stock based compensation arrangements and may adopt new standards that may have a material impact on our financial statements 
as of april   we entered into an employment agreement with mr 
oakleigh thorne  our chief executive officer 
as part of the agreement  in lieu of an annual salary  on april   mr 
thorne was granted an option to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  the closing price of the company s common stock on the grant date 
this option has a year term and vests monthly in twelve equal installments beginning january  in addition  on april   mr 
thorne was granted a performance option with a year term to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the performance option vested with respect to  shares as a result of the company meeting interim targets in our corporate bonus plan as of june  and with respect to an additional  shares as a result of the company meeting a portion of the year end financial targets in our corporate bonus plan 
the remaining  shares of the performance option did not vest pursuant to the corporate bonus plan and were forfeited as of december no compensation expense was recorded upon the issuance of the options granted to mr 
thorne due to the fact that the grant price was equal to the exercise price on the date of the grant 
however  the performance option was subject to variable accounting due to its performance based terms 
as a result  we were required to re measure compensation expense at each reporting date until each portion of the performance option vested or was forfeited 
since the closing price of the company s common stock on each interim and final compensation measurement date was less than the exercise price of  the amount of compensation expense was determined to be zero  and we did not record any stock based compensation expense for these options during the year ended december  we are currently considering adopting sfas no 
in to account for all of our stock based compensation plans 
if we had accounted for all of our stock based compensation plans in accordance with sfas no 
in the past  our net loss would have been reported as follows net loss applicable to common stockholders as reported apb opinion no 
expense recorded pro forma sfas no 
expense related to options pro forma sfas no 
expense related to employee stock purchase plan pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share as reported pro forma income taxes income taxes consist of federal  state and local taxes 
due to the judgement involved in accounting for income taxes and any related valuation allowance  it is a critical accounting policy for our company 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  resulting in net tax loss carryforwards 
we expect to realize net taxable income in the future  and therefore we expect to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards at some point 
however  utilization of such prospective net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations 
significant changes in ownership such as our public offering in may also limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses 
in addition  income taxes may be payable during this time  due to operating income in certain tax jurisdictions which cannot be offset by operating loss carryforwards 
if we achieve net taxable income and the net operating loss carryforwards are not available  because they have been exhausted or have expire d  we may experience significant tax expense 
we have recorded no provision or benefit for federal and state income taxes because we have incurred net operating losses from inception through december  as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income  which expire in varying amounts beginning in we have established a valuation allowance against the entire amount of our deferred tax asset as of december   because we have not been able to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the deferred tax asset  due primarily to our history of operating losses 
should we conclude that these deferred tax assets are  at least in part  realizable  the valuation allowance will be reversed to the extent of such realizability 
the reversal of the valuation allowance  if any  would be recognized as deferred income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations and would increase our earnings per share in the period of reversal 
in future years  we will continue to assess our deferred tax assets for recoverability  which will require significant judgement on behalf of our management  if we generate net income 
results of operations we have incurred significant losses since our inception  resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we believe that our revenue growth will continue in the year primarily based upon growth in student fees  as our current customers add more online students and we add new customers from our target market 
at the same time  we intend to continue to make investments in technology which may involve the development  acquisition or licensing of technologies that complement or augment our existing services and technologies 
our selling and marketing expense should increase slightly as part of our strategy in we also intend to utilize our existing administrative resources and operating efficiencies to continue to support our company 
our operating loss decreased significantly during and we expect this trend to continue 
we expect to have positive net income in  although there can be no guarantee thereof 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the  increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase in the number of student enrollments in online courses 
student enrollments in ecourses increased to  from  in the prior year 
student enrollments in our lower priced ecompanion course supplements increased to  from  in the prior year  however total revenue recognized from such supplements decreased during due primarily to a special pricing program offered to customers with committments to significant online distance education programs 
student fees represented  and  of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of 
campus and course fees represented  and  of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
we recognized revenue from developing  licensing and hosting online campuses for different customers during  up from the customers that had online campuses in there were  new ecourses developed on our platform in  of which were developed by our professionals 
this compares to  and  respectively in with the ease of use features and improved self authoring functionality of our products  we have seen and may continue to see more customers self design and develop online courses  resulting in lower revenue from our course development services 
other revenue includes technical and instructional design consulting revenue of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
nist grant revenue decreased to  from  for these same periods  respectively  due to the expiration of our research grant in april we expect to see continued growth in revenue in  but we expect that a greater percentage of that growth will be driven by the growth in student fee revenue as revenue from other product and service lines remain relatively stable 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
our cost of revenue decreased primarily due to a reduction in the total costs under our grant program and the related decrease in our grant program liabilities  reduced personnel costs for our operations and account management groups and reduced outside consulting expenses 
the grant program resulted in a net reduction of cost of revenue expenses of  for the year ended december  compared to a net increase in cost of revenue expenses of  for grant program activities for the year ended december  our average number of personnel in the operations and account management areas decreased to for the year ended december  from in the same period in  as we were able to improve on our operating efficiencies of our course development  help desk and consulting ser vices while also concluding our nist research program 
personnel costs were  less in than in while external consulting decreased by  commission expense increased  however  by  from to amortization expense related to our capitalized software costs for years ended december  and was  and  respectively  all of which is included in cost of revenue 
we expect our cost of revenue to remain relatively stable in due to operating efficiencies and current excess capacity in our data centers  as well as the expiration of the grant program and related expenses 
gross margin 
we realized a gross profit of  for the year ended december  as compared to a gross profit of  for year ended december  the favorable increase of  was primarily due to the increase in our student fees  which have a higher contribution margin than most of our other revenue sources  improved utilization of our professional services and consulting staff as we continue to improve the technology and business processes used to develop campuses and courses for our customers  and realization of operating leverage on the generally fixed nature of our data center expenses as our revenue increased 
also contributing to the increased gross profit was the reduction of estimated total costs related to our grant program and the expiration of our nist research program 
since we expect our revenue to increase in and our cost of revenue to remain consistent with levels  we expect continued improvement in our gross margin in product development 
product development expenses of  for the year ended december  were higher than the  expenses incurred for the year ended december  as we continue to design and develop enhanced features for our course management system and other product and hosting offerings  our personnel costs in the development group have increased by  however  the increase in personnel costs was partially offset by a  decrease in external consulting expense incurred during the year ended december   as compared with the same period in our development staff remained consistent with an average of employees for and we expect our development costs to increase slightly in from the level incurred in as we continue to develop new products to respond to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease was partially due to decreases in direct mail and trade conference expenses of  which were somewhat offset by increased promotion costs of  as we focused on more activities directed at key decision makers within our target markets 
marketing expenses associated with the grant program for the year ended december  were  less than those in the same period last year 
our marketing personnel costs decreased  as we were staffed with an average of marketing related employees during the year ended december   down from an average of such employees in we also had a decrease in outside consulting services of  in the year ended  while depreciation expense associated with our sales and marketing groups decreased  from the same period last year 
our sales staff decreased to an average of employees in from in as we eliminated our internal telemarketing sales department in january we expect an increase in total selling and marketing expenses in as we attempt to grow our customer base 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in executive compensation  severance and amortization of deferred compensation  as well as other cost savings due to improved efficiencies 
total administrative salaries and other benefits decreased  and amortization of deferred compensation for our executives and board of directors decreased by approximately  these savings outweighed moderate increases in corporate insurance and building occupancy costs during we also incurred  of expenses related to our corporate headquarters move during the year ended december  our executive and administrative personnel decreased to an average of in from during we record deferred compensation in connection with the grant of stock options and restricted common stock to employees  officers  directors and former executives in accordance with our stock based compensation accounting policy 
the deferred charge is being amortized over the relevant vesting period of such options or restricted stock  which ranges from to years 
of the total deferred compensation we have recorded to date   was amortized in the year ended december   while  was amortized in the year ended december  all of the compensation expense related to such options and restricted stock in is included in general and administrative expense since it related to awards granted to executives  former executives and directors 
in a portion of such compensation expense was allocated to cost of revenue  selling and marketing expense and product development expense  as appropriate  based on the recipients of the awards vesting during we have  of deferred compensation recorded at december   of which we expect to amortize approximately  during we expect that our general and administrative expenses will not change significantly in terms of absolute dollars in other income expense 
interest and other income  which consists primarily of interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash invested in interest bearing securities as a result of the use of such cash in our operations 
interest expense  primarily related to our capital lease lines of credit  was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other expense of  during the year ended december  is primarily due to the net realized losses on sales of our short term investments 
as a result of a change in our investment policy during the third quarter of to limit risk exposure  all of our invested cash has been in money market accounts since october  therefore we do not anticipate incurring such losses in the future 
net loss 
our net loss decreased to  or per share  from  or per share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase in the number of student enrollments in online courses 
student enrollments in ecourses increased to  from  in the prior year 
student enrollments in our lower priced ecompanion course supplements increased to  from  in the prior year 
student fees represented  and  of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of campus and course development fees represented  and  of total revenue for the year ended december  and  respectively 
we recognized revenue from developing  licensing and hosting virtual campuses for different customers during  up from the customers that had virtual campuses in there were  new ecourses developed on our platform in  of which were developed by our professionals 
this compares to  and  respectively in with the ease of use features and improved self authoring functionality of our products  customers are able to update their own online campuses and self design and develop online courses  which resulted in lower development revenue from our campus and course development services 
other revenue includes professional consulting revenue of  and  and revenue from the nist grant of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  our cost of revenue increased primarily due to the amortization of  of software development costs related to our campusportal product previously capitalized and additional depreciation and occupancy costs related to cost of revenue of  we also had an increase in information technology expenses associated with hosting our customers programs 
the amount of expenses related to our grant program included in cost of revenue also increased by  to  from  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these increases were somewhat offset by decreases in personnel costs  as we were able to support our revenue growth through increased operating efficiencies 
our operations and account management personnel decreased to an average of in from during  with most of the reductions coming in march total cost of revenue was approximately and of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margin 
we experienced a positive gross margin of  or of revenue  for the year ended december  as compared to a negative gross margin of  for the year ended december  the favorable increase of  in gross margin was primarily due to the increase in our student fees resulting from our increased student enrollments  which have a higher contribution margin than our other revenue sources  as well as improved utilization of our professional services staff and realization of operating leverage on our fixed expenses as our revenue increased 
product development 
during the year ended december   we expanded and improved our teaching solutions product line  including the release of the next generation of our cms  ecollege au 
the new platform provided enhanced features with increased customization capabilities  usability and accessibility for our customers 
additionally  due to the significant investments we made in to improve our efficiency in developing online campuses and courses  we were able to reduce our overall product development costs in product development expenses decreased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to our decreased use of external consulting for product development during staffing levels of our product development personnel remained consistent with the prior year  averaging in and in we also capitalized  of internal use software development c osts related to our campusportal product during the year ended december   compared to the  capitalized during the year ended december  therefore  we had a total of  and  in product development expenditures during and  respectively 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to decreases in advertising and marketing personnel salaries and benefits expense  as we averaged and marketing related employees during and  respectively 
marketing costs associated with our grant program in were  less than in external advertising expenses also decreased  during the year ended december   as we focused our marketing strategy on more efficient methods 
the decrease in selling and marketing expenses also reflects decreases in amounts spent on marketing collaterals  trade show participation and other promotional activities 
our sales personnel decreased slightly to an average of employees in from in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease was due in large part to a decrease in amortization of deferred compensation due to employee terminations  as well as decreases in executive compensation and severance  consulting services and other cost savings due to improved efficiencies in our administrative departments 
we recorded  and  of stock based compensation expense in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of compensation expense related to such options is included in general and administrative expense in each of these years 
however  a portion of such compensation expense has been allocated to cost of revenue  selling and marketing expense and product development expense as appropriate 
our executive and administrative personnel decreased to an average of in from during  including the termination of our president and chief operating officer 
other general and administrative expense 
additional non cash general and administrative expenses of  reflect the fair market value of fully vested options issued during the third quarter of to a non employee investment partnership in exchange for the services of our chief executive officer in lieu of salary  benefits and other compensation 
this expense was not incurred during the year ended december  other income expense 
interest and other income  which consists primarily of interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash invested as a result of the use of such cash in our operations 
interest expense decreased slightly during compared to other expense of  is primarily due to the net realized losses on sales of our short term investments during the year ended december  net loss 
our net loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle decreased to  or per share  from  or per share  for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december  effective january   the company recorded a  one time cumulative adjustment in connection with the adoption of sab therefore  our net loss decreased to  or per share  from  or per share  for the years ended december   as compared with the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents decreased  to  at december  from  at december  this decrease from december  was primarily due to cash used in operating activities of  and cash used for investment in software and equipment of  partially offset by cash provided by financing activities of  including net borrowings under our line of credit of  in we expect to have more cash provided by our operating activities in than the net amounts expected to be used for investment and financing activities 
therefore  we anticipate our cash and cash equivalents at december  to be greater than the recorded balance at december   without raising additional capital 
we have financed the majority of our operations through the issuance of equity securities 
we have sold common stock and preferred stock generating aggregate proceeds of  from inception through december   including our initial public offering 
we used the net proceeds from our equity financings for funding capital expenditures and supporting sales  marketing  product development activities  expanding our data centers  investing in short term marketable securities with maturities of one year or less  enhancing financial information systems and for other expenses associated with our growth 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and working capital  together with cash generated from operations  are sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
through december   we have leased  of equipment under a series of draws on a sale leaseback agreement entered into in the second quarter of at the end of the initial month lease term  we are required to purchase the equipment for of the amount drawn 
through december   we have leased  of equipment under a series of draws on a separate sale leaseback agreement entered into in the second quarter of at the end of the initial month lease term  we are required to purchase the equipment for of the amount drawn under the second sale leaseback agreement 
these leases are treated as capital leases for accounting purposes 
as of december  and  the company leased  and  of equipment  respectively 
accumulated depreciation on leased equipment was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
our total capital lease obligations  including interest  as of december  and  were  and  respectively 
we have a  revolving line of credit with a maturity date of march  which we expect to renew in march the line of credit is secured by all of our assets 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is an adjustable rate of prime  which was as of december   plus 
in december  the company drew  from the revolving line which remained outstanding at december  the entire  draw was subsequently repaid in january in december  the company drew  from the revolving line which remained outstanding at december  the entire  draw was subsequently repaid in january if we do not renew the line of credit in march  our cash and cash equivalents at march  are expected to be lower than the balance recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  however  our working capital would not be affected by the non renewal of the line of credit and we believe we would have sufficient cash to meet our capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the lease agreements and line of credit contain certain financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  in connection with the revolving line of credit  we issued warrants to the lender for  shares of common stock 
the exercise price of the warrants was  the offering price of common shares sold in connection with our initial public offering on december  the value of the warrants at the date of issuance was  which was recorded as a deferred financing cost and was amortized to interest expense over the original term of the revolving line of credit 
in october  all of these warrants expired unexercised 
although at this time our plans do not include raising additional capital  in the future  we may desire to or be required to raise additional capital 
in the event that we need to raise additional capital  we cannot assure that additional funds will be available or that funds will be available on terms favorable to ecollege 
our need to raise additional funds could also directly and adversely affect our stockholders investment in our common stock 
when a company raises funds by issuing shares of stock  the percentage ownership of the existing stockholders of that company is reduced  or diluted 
if we raise funds in the future by issuing additional shares of stock  stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares 
stockholders may also experience dilution in the value of their shares if we issue additional shares of stock and receive funds from the exercise of outstanding stock options 
off balance sheet operating lease obligations the company leases office space and equipment under various non cancelable operating leases 
at december  the aggregate future minimum lease commitments were as follows year ending december  thereafter rent expense for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
risk factors the primary risk factors that affect our business are as follows we operate in a highly competitive market the online learning market is evolving quickly and is subject to rapid technological change 
the market is highly competitive  with no single competitor accounting for a dominant market share 
competition is most intense from software companies with specific products for the college and university market  companies which seek to offer a complete solution utilizing their own services and third party software  systems integrators  and hardware vendors 
some colleges and universities construct online learning systems utilizing in house personnel and creating their own software or purchasing software components from a vendor 
other competitors in this market include a wide range of education and training providers using video  mail correspondence  cd rom  and live online training 
we believe that the level of competition will continue as new technologies are developed  as current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market 
some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
certain competitors may be able to secure alliances with customers and affiliates on more favorable terms  devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns and devote substantially more resources to systems development than we can 
in addition  it is possible that certain competitors  or potential competitors  could reduce their pricing to levels that would make it difficult for us to compete 
increased competition may result in reduced operating margins  as well as loss of market share and brand recognition 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from a relatively small number of customers revenue from a small number of customers has comprised a substantial portion of our revenue and is expected to represent a substantial portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
in  our top customers accounted for approximately of our revenue 
in  our top customers accounted for approximately of our revenue 
any cancellation  deferral or significant reduction in work performed for these principal clients  or failure to collect accounts receivable from these principal clients  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our network infrastructure and computer systems may fail the continuing and uninterrupted performance of our network infrastructure and computer systems is critical to our success 
any system failure that causes interruptions in our ability to provide services could reduce customer satisfaction and  if sustained or repeated  would reduce the attractiveness of our technology and services to our customers and their students 
an increase in the number of students online through our servers could strain the capacity of our software or hardware  which could lead to slower response times or system failures 
we continually test our user capacity by simulating load capacity based on projected student enrollments 
to the extent we do not successfully address capacity constraints  such constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our success depends on our ability to provide superior network security protection and the confidence of our customers in that ability 
our system is designed to prevent unauthorized access from the internet and  to date  our operations have not been affected by security breaks  nevertheless  in the future we may not be able to prevent unauthorized disruptions of our network operations  whether caused unintentionally or by computer hackers 
our operations are also dependent upon our ability to protect our computer systems against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failures  vandalism and other malicious acts  and similar unexpected adverse events  including the consequences of terrorist attacks 
in addition  the failure of our multiple telecommunications providers or our multiple network backbone providers  which provides us with our internet connection  to provide the data communications capacity and network infrastructure in the time frame we require could cause service i nterruptions or slower response times 
despite precautions we have taken  unanticipated problems affecting our systems have from time to time in the past caused  and in the future could cause  interruptions or delays in the delivery of our products and services 
any damage or failure that interrupts or delays our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we are almost exclusively dependent on microsoft for our underlying software technology platform 
we are therefore potentially vulnerable to business or operational disruption caused by changes in the microsoft platform  security flaws in microsoft software  and or potential price increases or licensing changes by microsoft 
the rapidly developing and changing market for our products and services makes it difficult to predict future growth it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate  if any  of the market for our products and services 
as is typical in the case of a rapidly evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
our future success will depend in significant part on our ability to continue to improve the performance  features and reliability of our products and services in response to evolving demands of the marketplace  changing industry standards  and competitive product offerings  and we cannot assure that we will be successful in developing  integrating or marketing such products or services 
we may need additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable terms although at this time our plans do not require us to raise additional capital  we may seek to raise additional capital in the future 
circumstances that could cause us to consider raising additional capital include acquisitions and working capital needs 
in the event that we need to raise additional capital  we cannot assure that additional funds will be available or that funds will be available on terms favorable to us 
our inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial position 
any future need to raise additional funds could also directly and adversely affect our stockholders investment in our common stock 
if we raise funds in the future by issuing additional shares of stock  stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares 
government regulation may adversely affect our future operating results the federal government  through the higher education act and other legislation  may consider changes in the law that affect distance education in higher education 
legislation could be adopted that would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet  relating to user privacy  content  copyrights  distribution  and characteristics and quality of products and services 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the popularity or expansion of online education  and may cause us to incur unanticipated compliance costs 
our increasing presence in many states across the country may subject us to additional tax laws and government regulations  which may adversely affect our future operating results 
our violation of any state statutes  laws or other regulations  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business 
we depend on our customers and third parties to market student enrollments a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from fees for each enrollment in an online course that we implement 
generally  we do not market directly to students to generate enrollments in our customer s courses and therefore have little influence on the number of students that enroll 
we are therefore dependent on the institutions and organizations that purchase our products and services to market to individual students 
the failure of these third parties to effectively attract  maintain  and increase student enrollments could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
in addition to the primary risk factors listed above  our business is also subject to the following more general risk factors our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may be below the expectations of analysts and investors because of the emerging nature of the online learning market  we may be unable to accurately forecast our revenue 
the sales cycle for our products and services varies widely and it may be difficult for us to predict the timing of particular sales  the rate at which online campuses  courses and or course supplements will be implemented or the number of students who will enroll in the online courses 
since most of our costs are fixed and are based on anticipated revenue levels  small variations in the timing of revenue recognition could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
since we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  any significant decrease in revenue would likely have an immediate material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our stock price is likely to be volatile the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following  some of which are beyond our control quarterly variations in our operating results  operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  changes in market valuations of other online service companies  future sales of our common stock  stock market price and volume fluctuations  general political and economic conditions  such as a recession or war or terrorist attacks or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations  and other risk factors described in this form k 
moreover  our stock is thinly traded  and we have a relatively small public float 
these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the market prices for stocks of many internet related and technology companies have historically experie nced extreme price fluctuations that appeared to bear no relationship to the operating performance of these companies 
we depend on our key personnel our success depends on the performance of senior management and on our ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified technical professionals 
the loss of the services of a number of senior management personnel or highly qualified technical professionals could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our sales cycle is lengthy and can vary widely the sales cycle between initial customer contact and signing of a contract varies widely  reflecting differences in our customers decision making processes and budget cycles 
as a result  we may not be able to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales and resulting revenue 
any acquisitions or investments we make could be disruptive to our business  have adverse accounting consequences or be dilutive to our investors although we have no present agreement or understanding relating to any material acquisition or investment  from time to time we have had discussions with companies regarding our acquiring  or investing in  their businesses 
if we buy a company  we could have difficulty in assimilating its operations  or assimilating and retaining its key personnel 
also  acquisitions may result in a variety of accounting charges  which could increase our reported expenses  including impairment of goodwill and the write off of acquired in process research and development 
furthermore  we may incur debt or issue dilutive equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions or investments 
as a result  any future business acquisitions or investments could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we have a history of net operating losses we have experienced aggregate net losses from operations of  since our inception in july  including losses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there can be no guarantee that we will achieve profitability  and if we do  we may not be able to sustain profitability 
we believe that our success depends  among other things  on our ability to increase our revenue by further developing existing customer relationships and developing new relationships with colleges  universities and other potential clients 
if we are unable to continue to increase our revenue  our business and financial results will be materially and adversely affected 
we must protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights our success depends  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and technology  such as our trade and product names  and the proprietary software included in our products 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  servicemarks  patents  trade secret laws  and employee and third party nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect these rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to duplicate or copy aspects of our services or software or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we may from time to time encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property 
these disputes could lead to litigation  which may be time consuming and costly even if successful  require us to redesign our products or services  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to risk from general economic conditions our revenue are subject to fluctuation as a result of general economic conditions 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of products and services to colleges and universities 
should current weak economic conditions continue or worsen  these organizations may not increase or may reduce their expenditures  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
our business and future operating results are subject to a broad range of uncertainties arising out of the terrorist attacks on the united states our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of the terrorist attacks on the united states of america in september and the current war with iraq 
these uncertainties include the potential worsening or extension of the current global economic slowdown and the economic consequences of military action or additional terrorist activities 
while the recent terrorist attacks have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  any future attacks or events arising as a result of the attacks  such as interruptions to the international telecommunications network or the internet  could have a material impact on our business 
we continue to refine our pricing and our products and services and cannot predict whether the ongoing changes will be accepted over the past few years we have implemented several changes and continue to make such changes in our pricing and our product and service offerings to increase revenue and to meet the needs of our customers 
we cannot predict whether our current pricing and products and services  or any ongoing refinements we make will be accepted by our existing customer base or by prospective customers 
if our customers and potential customers to not accept our current or future pricing or products and services offering  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
general economic conditions may impact the value and realizability of our investment securities factors influencing the financial condition of the issuers of securities with whom we invest our idle cash may impact their ability meet their financial obligations 
our short term investment portfolio is invested in united states government securities  money market accounts investing in united states government securities  and commercial bank certificates of deposit 
the company s current investment policy requires that its investment portfolio be limited to investment securities of less than one year in maturity 
as of december  all of our invested cash is in money market accounts 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
this statement applies to recognized long lived assets of an entity to be held and used or to be disposed of 
this statement does not apply to goodwill  intangible assets not being amortized  financial instruments  and deferred tax assets 
this statement requires an impairment loss to be recorded for assets to be held and used when the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from future estimated cash flows and exceeds its fair value 
an asset that is classified as held for s ale shall be recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in april and july  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on two issues within issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
eitf was subsequently codified along with other related eitf issues into eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor or a reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
during the first quarter of  we completed our review of the provisions of eitf and concluded that the payments made under our grant program are properly classified as costs and not a reduction of the selling price of our services 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 
 which i amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation ii amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation and iii amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
items ii and iii of the new requirements in sfas no 
are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  we have included the requirements of item ii in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements and will include the requirements of item iii beginning in our first quarter of in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  which requires that  for guarantees within the scope of fin issued or amended after december   a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee be recognized 
fin does not apply to certain guarantee contracts  such as for a lessee s residual value guarantee embedded in a capital lease 
fin also requires additional disclosures in financial statements for periods ending after december   which we have adopted 
however  as of december   we believe that we have no material items subject to the new disclosure requirements 
we are currently evaluating fin  however  it is not expected that the recognition and measurement provisions of fin will have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in december  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses how to allocate revenue in arrangements that include more than one product or service and governs how to identify whether goods or services or both that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately 
eitf is applied prospectively to arrangements entered into in periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating eitf and are in the process of determining the impact eitf will have on the company s financial position and results of operations  if any 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  to address the consolidation issues around certain types of entities  including special purpose entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated if the company s variable interest ie  investment in the entity will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses and or residual returns if they occur 
fin is applicable immediately to any variable interest entities formed after january  and must be applied in the third quarter to any such entity created before february  we are currently reviewing the provisions of fin and do not expect its implementation to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
seasonality because the majority of our revenue is derived from the number of students our customers have enrolled in online courses and course supplements delivered on our course management system  our results of operations are impacted somewhat by the seasonality inherent in the traditional academic calendar 
however  in  we continued to see our customers offer more non traditional course terms  which has mitigated the seasonality of our results 
we expect this trend to continue in the future 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature and seasonal fluctuations in revenue will result in seasonal fluctuation in our operating results 
as a result  sequential quarter to quarter financial results are not directly comparable 
selected quarterly information in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that our revenue and other operating results should not be relied upon as indications of future performance

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
the company is  or may become  exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically  and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
additionally  the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash  which was  at december  historically we have invested available cash in money market accounts  certificates of deposit and investment grade commercial paper that generally had maturities of three months or less  as well as debt securities of united states government agencies and corporate bonds 
our short term investment portfolio is managed on a discretionary basis by a third party  subject to our investment policy 
the company s investment policy requires that its investment portfolio be limited to investment securities of less than one year in maturity 
furthermore  as a result of a change in the company s investment strategy during the third quarter of to limit risk exposure  all of our invested cash has been in money market accounts since october as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at december   is low 
ho wever  factors influencing the financial condition of security issuers may impact their ability to meet their financial obligations and could impact the realizability of our security portfolio 
we have not undertaken any other interest rate market risk management activities 
included in the results of operations for the year ending december  are net realized losses on marketable securities of  these losses are primarily due to the  loss sustained upon the sale of our investment in a commercial bond issued by southern california edison 
due to certain circumstances related to the state of california s regulatory environment  the fair value of our investment in the southern california edison bond had declined from its original purchased cost of  and we believed that the future value of these bonds would continue to be uncertain 
therefore  the company elected to sell these bonds in september to reduce the risk in our investment portfolio 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s debt instruments or our cash equivalents nor would it materially impact the earnings or cash flow associated with our cash investments 
see note to the financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
although our revolving line of credit bears interest at an adjustable rate of prime plus  a hypothetical ten percent change in the market rates as of december  would not have a material effect on our earnings and cash flows in  as the entire borrowings outstanding at december  were repaid on january  we anticipate drawing on our line of credit only for short term working capital needs during
