item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the effect of interest rates on the company s profitability  and the adequacy of the company s allowance for future loan losses 
several factors  including the virginia and national economies and the demand for residential mortgage loans may adversely affect the company s ability to achieve expected results 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis only as of the date of this report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included as exhibit of this form k 
results of operations and financial condition the company had net income of  for   for  and  for this constituted net basic earnings per common share of for  for  and for with the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents  earnings per common share were for  for  and for in regard to business segment reporting  the company s mortgage banking operations generated net income before taxes of  for   for  and  for the year ended december  at december   of total loans were due in one year or less 
floating rate loans with maturities of one year or less represented of total loans  and the remainder of loans had fixed rates 
average loans  net of unearned income  to average deposits were   and in  and  respectively 
net interest income net interest income  before provision for loan losses  increased by in over to  and in over to  the increase in net interest income was closely proportionate with the increase in average earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during during  due to the continued expansion of the bank s commercial lending activities  average loans increased to  due to the competitive pricing of the company s deposit products  average total deposits increased to  average funds borrowed from the federal home loan bank and correspondent banks increased by to  in as part of its mortgage banking operations  funds advanced on behalf of investor banks in settlement of mortgage loans increased to  in average securities increased to  and average interest bearing deposits in other banks decreased to  in for a historical analysis of net interest income  see the table entitled average balances  interest income and expenses  and average yields and rates in part i item of this form k 
for an analysis of the potential for a change in interest rates to impact the ability of the bank to generate future net interest income  see the table entitled maturing or repricing in part i item of this form k 
this is frequently referred to as the gap analysis  which analyzes the difference between interest sensitive assets and liabilities for the repricing maturity periods indicated 
see also item a of this form k for a discussion of interest rate sensitivity and market risk 
as can be seen from the historical analysis and the gap analysis  the company is in an asset sensitive position in the short term 
an asset sensitive institution s net interest margin and net interest income generally will be impacted favorably by rising interest rates  while that of a liability sensitive institution generally will be impacted favorably by declining rates 
increases and decreases in mortgage banking income  which consists primarily of gains on sales of mortgage loans  tend to offset decreases and increases in the net interest margin 
in a climate of lower or declining interest rates  
table of contents net interest margin will tend to decrease as the yield on interest earning assets decreases faster than the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
mortgage banking income  in contrast  tends to increase in times of lower or declining interest rates  as refinancing activity leads to an increase in mortgage loan originations 
in a climate of rising or higher interest rates  the net interest margin will tend to increase  while a decrease in mortgage loan originations leads to a decrease in mortgage banking income 
allowance for loan losses the ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding was

in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans at year end was   and  at december   and  respectively 
the level of non performing loans at year end was   and  at december   and  or   and of total loans  respectively 
management made a provision for loan loss of  in   in  and  in see summary of loan loss experience in part i item of this form k 
in establishing the allowance for loan losses  management considers a number of factors  including loan asset quality  related collateral and economic conditions prevailing during the loan s repayment 
in its loan policies  management has emphasized the borrower s ability to service the debt  the borrower s general creditworthiness and the quality of collateral 
while management believes that the allowance is sufficient for the existing loan portfolio  there can be no assurances that an additional allowance for losses on existing loans may not be necessary in the future  particularly if economic conditions within the company s market areas were to deteriorate 
potential problem loans at december   the company had  in non accrual loans  a decrease of from december  non accrual loans consisted of eight individual credits and the total was less than one half of one percent of total loans 
the company had  in loans past due days or more that were still accruing at december  management believes that the loans past due days or more and still accruing are well secured and in the process of collection 
in addition to loans on either non accrual status or loans past due days or more and still accruing  management had identified  of loans that have been internally classified 
these loans require more than normal attention and are potentially problem loans 
for the historical analysis of the bank s loan loss experience  see the table entitled summary of loan loss experience in part i item of this form k 
non interest income and non interest expenses non interest income in was  up from  in due to the increased income derived from the residential mortgage banking operations and placement fees from the commercial mortgage operations

liquidity the company s funding requirements are supplied from a range of traditional sources  including various types of demand deposits  money market accounts  certificates of deposit and short term borrowings 
large certificates of deposit accounted for  and of total deposits at december   and  respectively 
federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb advances were also utilized as funding sources  with   and  in such advances outstanding at december   and  respectively 
pursuant to the terms of a variable rate line of credit with the fhlb  the bank may borrow up to of the bank s assets 
this fhlb credit facility has no expiration date  but is re evaluated periodically to determine the bank s credit worthiness 
additionally  the bank has a warehouse line of credit collateralized by first mortgage loans  amounting to  and is renewable annually 
as of december   there was no balance drawn from this line of credit 
management has no reason to believe these arrangements will not be renewed 

table of contents management seeks to ensure adequate liquidity to fund loans and meet the company s financial requirements and opportunities 
to provide liquidity for current  ongoing and unanticipated needs  the company maintains federal funds sold  money market accounts and a portfolio of debt securities 
the company also structures and monitors the flow of funds from debt securities and from maturing loans 
securities are generally purchased to provide a source of liquidity 
at december   the company had  fair market value  in securities available for sale and  amortized cost  in securities held to maturity 
unrealized holding gains and losses for available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
securities are composed of governmental or quasi governmental agencies  and investment grade preferred stocks and bonds of corporations 
there were no federal funds sold to correspondent institutions at december   and  respectively 
in february  the company raised net proceeds of approximately million through the sale of  shares of common stock in a public offering  at a price of per share before underwriting discounts 
the company raised approximately  of additional capital in the fourth quarter of by offering  trust preferred securities at a price of  per security 
these securities bear a variable distribution rate per annum  reset quarterly  equal to libor plus  provided that the applicable interest rate may not exceed through the interest payment date in november these securities have a mandatory redemption date of november   and are subject to varying call provisions at the option of the company beginning november  the company raised approximately  of additional capital in the fourth quarter of by offering  trust preferred securities at a price of  per security

on july   the company raised an additional  of net proceeds through the sale of  additional shares as part of the same offering 
the company raised approximately  of additional capital in the first quarter of by offering  trust preferred securities at a price of per security 
the securities feature a coupon 
the company  in turn  purchased  of non cumulative preferred stock issued by the bank during the course of this preferred stock qualifies as tier capital for the bank for regulatory purposes 
this additional tier capital provided the bank with an increased loan to one borrower limitation  and the ability to continue to grow its balance sheet while maintaining its well capitalized status 
the preferred stock coupon matches the coupon of the trust preferred securities 
the company repurchased and retired million of these securities in the third quarter of  leaving million outstanding 
the company s stock repurchase program was implemented in part to help offset the potential dilutive effect of stock options granted to the company s management as employment recruitment and retention perquisites 
during  and  the company repurchased   and  shares of its common stock  respectively 
critical accounting policies the accounting principles followed by the company and the methods of applying these principles conform with generally accepted accounting principles and to general practices within the banking industry 
the most critical accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
these policies require the use of subjective and complex estimates  assumptions and judgments  which are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  that are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results 
accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained at levels deemed adequate by management to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio  based upon evaluation of the risks in the portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
estimates for loan losses are determined by analyzing historical loan losses  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  the opinions of regulators  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and industry data 
the company also considers the impact of economic events  the outcome of which are uncertain 
while management uses the best information available in establishing the allowance  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making valuations  or if required by regulators based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations 
although management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate and properly recorded in the financial statements  differing economic conditions or alternate methods of estimation could result in materially different amounts of loan losses 
as part of the company s funding strategy  derivative financial instruments are used to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments 
all of these derivative financial instruments are interest rate swaps  which are designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  and measurement of changes in the fair value of hedged items 
management believes that the techniques for addressing these judgmental areas are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and in line with industry practices in assessing hedge effectiveness 
however  if in the future the derivative financial instruments in use no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment and  consequently  the change in fair value of hedged items could not be recognized in earnings  the impact on consolidated results of operations and reported earnings could be significant 
management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the company s financial statements 
all of the derivative financial instruments used have active markets and indications of fair value can be readily obtained 
the estimation of fair value is significant to a number of assets  including funds advanced in settlement of mortgage loans  available for sale investment securities  and other real estate owned  as well as assets and liabilities associated with derivative financial instruments 
these are all recorded at either fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values can be volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and market conditions  among others 
since these factors can change significantly and rapidly  fair values are difficult to predict and are subject to material changes  which could impact the company s financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  has issued fasb issues interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the fasb did not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
this interpretation also incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded by this document 
certain guarantee arrangements are completely excluded from the scope of this interpretation and certain others are only excluded from the recognition and measurement provisions 
the incremental disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the company has conformed to the required disclosures in its december  financial statements  and must begin to recognize the fair value of guarantees issued or modified beginning january  the accounting followed by the guarantor on prior guarantees may not be changed to conform with the guidance in this interpretation 
the company does not expect this interpretation to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents capital resources and adequacy the federal reserve board  the fdic and the office of thrift supervision have issued substantially similar risk based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to banking organizations they supervise 
due to the bank s capitalization  it is classified as well capitalized 
the company s year end capital to asset ratio was at december   at december  and at december  the company is also classified as well capitalized 
the capital adequacy standards are based on an established minimum for risk based capital  tier risk based capital and the tier leverage ratio 
the following table summarizes the company s regulatory capital ratios at december  required ratio resource bankshares resource bank tier risk based total risk based tier leverage to the company is in full compliance with all relevant regulatory capital requirements 
availability of budgets and related financial information on an ongoing basis  the company s management prepares and updates one year and five year forward looking budgets and financial plans 
this information is prepared by management for the purpose of assessing current business  economic and monetary conditions and the likely impact of those conditions on the company s future business  results of operations and financial condition 
these budgets and financial plans are used by management to assist with decisions related to  among other matters  asset and liability management  capital resource allocation and loan loss projections 
upon prior request  this budgetary and financial information is available for review by any current or potential shareholder 
any current or potential shareholder that obtains this information from the company should be aware that the budgetary and financial data necessarily includes certain projections with respect to the potential future financial performance of the company 
the assumptions and estimates underlying the projections are inherently uncertain and  though considered reasonable by the company  are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the projected results will be realized 
the company s actual results in the future will vary from the projected results  and those variations may be material 
in addition  management is not under any obligation to update its budgets and financial plans  even in the event the assumptions or estimates underlying the information are shown to be in error 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management s methodology to measure interest rate sensitivity includes an analysis of the potential gain or loss in future fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments 
the company s analysis assumes a hypothetical basis point instantaneous and parallel shift in the yield curve in interest rates 
a present value computation is used in determining the effect of the hypothetical interest rate changes on the fair value of its interest rate sensitive instruments as of december  computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on many assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay 
they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate certain 
table of contents actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in this method of analysis 
if market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of present value  actual values may differ from amounts disclosed 
however  if a hypothetical  parallel and instantaneous basis point increase and decrease were experienced  net fair values of interest sensitive instruments would be decreased by  and decreased by  respectively 
in addition  for the same parallel and instantaneous rate shocks  annualized net interest income would increase by  and decrease by  as the result of a respective basis point increase and decrease in rates 
this fair value analysis  performed for the company by a third party vendor  tends to overstate interest rate risk within the company s balance sheet 
the analysis assigns the contractual long term maturity to mortgage loans within the funds advanced for settlement account 
the company generally holds such loans for less than days  because the loans are pre sold to third party purchasers when the individual borrowers lock in their interest rates 
this extension of loan terms within this category of the company s balance sheet increases interest rate risk sensitivity calculated by the analysis 
the analysis also does not include a forecast of loan and deposit volume changes due to the hypothetical basis point interest rate change 
in addition  anticipated increased volume in the company s mortgage banking operation from a basis point decrease in rates is not included in the analysis 
this expected volume increase in mortgage lending as the result of a decline in interest rates would positively impact the company s earnings 
the standard algebraic formula for calculating present value is utilized 
the calculation discounts the future cash flows of the company s portfolio of interest rate sensitive instruments to present value utilizing techniques designed to approximate current market rates for securities  current offering rates for loans  and the cost of alternative funding for the given maturity of deposits  and then assumes a basis point instantaneous and parallel shift in these rates 
the difference between these numbers represents the resulting hypothetical change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments 
other significant assumptions used in the calculation include no growth in volume ie  replacement of maturities in like instruments  with no change in balance sheet mix  constant market interest rates reflecting the average rate from the last month of the given quarter  and pricing spreads to market rates derived from an historical analysis  or from assumptions by instrument type
