item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered forward looking 
these statements contain a number of risks and uncertainties as discussed here and in item of this form k that could cause actual results to differ materially 
all information set forth in this annual report on form k has been retroactively adjusted to reflect a one for ten reverse stock split implemented on october  results of operations compared to financial statement net loss to common shareholders for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the significant change in the results from was primarily the result of million of impairment charges related to certain subordinated cmbs that were recognized during compared to impairment charges of million that were recognized during results include o approximately of impairment charges related to certain subordinated cmbs  o an approximate million non cash charge to write off goodwill upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 
 o approximately million from the gain on the sale by cmslp of master and direct servicing rights  and o approximately million reflected as an additional dividend on preferred stock in connection with the redemption of the series e preferred stock representing the difference between the aggregate liquidation value and the redemption price 
results include o approximately million of impairment charges related to certain subordinated cmbs  o approximately million of net revenue due to the effect of changes in accounting principles  primarily a change in accounting for servicing revenue  o an aggregate of approximately million of expenses relating to the chapter reorganization  and o approximately million of amortization that was recorded during the year ended december  on the goodwill written off on january  the following table provides a summary of the components of pro forma net loss to common shareholders and a reconciliation of pro forma net loss to common shareholders to gaap net loss to common shareholders for the years ended december  and the intent of this table is to provide a summary of the recurring results from operations and to isolate the non recurring items due to the large number of non recurring items included in the consolidated statements of income in accordance with gaap

these impairment charges represent of the amortized cost of the subordinated cmbs as of december  before the fourth quarter impairment charge was recorded 
the reduction in the interest income generally corresponded with the reduction in the amortized cost of the subordinated cmbs and the changes in the average yield to maturity  as discussed below 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  require that interest income earned on subordinated cmbs be recorded based on the effective interest method using the anticipated yield over the expected life of the subordinated cmbs 
based upon assumptions as to the timing and amount of future credit losses and other certain items estimated by management  as discussed below  the weighted average anticipated unleveraged yield for our subordinated cmbs for financial statement purposes was approximately as of january  and  approximately as of july   approximately as of october  and approximately as of january  these yields were determined based on the anticipated yield over the expected life of our subordinated cmbs  which considers  among other things  anticipated losses and any other than temporary impairment 
the effective interest method of recognizing interest income on subordinated cmbs results in income recognition that differs from cash received 
for the years ended december  and  the amount of income recognized in excess of cash received due to the effective interest rate method was approximately million and million  respectively 
interest income insured mortgage securities interest income from insured mortgage securities decreased by approximately million  or  to million during from million during this decrease was principally due to the prepayment of mortgages underlying the insured mortgage securities  representing approximately of the total insured mortgage portfolio from december  through december  the increase in prepayment activity corresponds with the low mortgage interest rate environment and the expiration of prepayment lock out periods on many of the insured mortgages 
these prepayments result in corresponding reductions in the outstanding principal balances of the collateralized mortgage obligations insured mortgage securities and the related interest expense 
interest expense interest expense of approximately million for was approximately million lower than the interest expense of approximately million for the decrease is attributable to a lower average debt balance during million compared to billion  partially offset by a higher average effective interest rate on total debt outstanding during compared to 
interest expense on the collateralized mortgage obligations insured mortgage securities decreased following significant prepayments of mortgages underlying the insured mortgage securities 
the decrease in interest expense on the collateralized mortgage obligations insured mortgage securities was partially offset by approximately million of additional discount amortization expenses during  which are included in interest expense 
these additional amortization expenses are the result of the mortgages prepaying faster than previously anticipated which  under the effective interest method of recognizing interest expense  required an adjustment to cumulative interest expense 
in addition  we adjusted our assumed prepayment speed for the amortization of the deferred financing costs and discount 
the overall weighted average effective interest rate on the exit debt was during the year ended december  the weighted average coupon pay rate on the exit debt was during the overall weighted average effective interest rate on the exit debt was for the period april  to december  the weighted average coupon rate on the exit debt was for the period april to december  the difference in the exit debt s weighted average effective interest rate and the weighted average coupon pay rate primarily related to the accrual of estimated extension fees and the accrued interest related to the per annum  accreting interest on the series b senior secured notes  both of which are included in the weighted average effective interest rate  but not included in the weighted average pay rate 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately  to million during as compared to million during primarily due to a decrease in legal fees in  partially offset by an increase in employment costs and higher directors and officers liability insurance premiums in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased by approximately million to million during as compared to million during the decrease is primarily attributable to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  the adoption of sfas no 
reduced our annual amortization expense by approximately million

in cumulative effect of adoption of sfas below 
mortgage servicing equity in earnings losses from investments in july  we began accounting for cmslp on a consolidated basis due to a reorganization which resulted in the partnership interests of cmslp being held by two of our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries or trss 
prior to july  we accounted for cmslp under the equity method as we did not control the voting common stock of the general partner of cmslp 
cmslp s assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses are labeled as servicing on our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the consolidated results of operations of cmslp year ended december  description cmslp s results of operations reflected in consolidated income statements effective july  servicing revenue   servicing general and administrative expenses   servicing amortization  depreciation and impairment   servicing restructuring expenses   servicing gain on sale of servicing rights  servicing gain on sale of investment grade cmbs  gaap net income loss from cmslp   see also the discussion in income tax expense benefit below 
the net income from cmslp of million for the year ended december  compares to the aggregate of the net equity in losses from cmslp criimi mae services  inc or cmsi of million for the year ended december  as summarized below and the net loss from cmslp of million for the six months ended december  cmslp s net income of million during includes a million gain from the sale of servicing rights and  of restructuring expenses 
cmslp s total revenue decreased by approximately million to approximately million during compared to million during includes full year results 
this decrease is primarily the result of the sale of servicing rights which reduced mortgage servicing income and interest income earned on the escrow balances  partially offset by higher revenue from special servicing 
general and administrative expenses were million and million includes full year results during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the staff reductions that occurred in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of following cmslp s sale of its cmbs master and direct servicing contracts  as discussed below 
during  amortization  depreciation and impairment was approximately million as compared to million includes full year results during this million decrease was primarily the result of the sale of servicing rights in february  which reduced amortization expense  and lower impairment on cmbs held by cmslp during as compared to the decrease was partially offset by impairment that was recorded on cmslp s investment in aim limited partnerships subadvisory contracts 
during  the aim limited partnerships experienced a significant amount of prepayments of their insured mortgages 
these prepayments reduced cmslp s cash flows from its subadvisory contracts with the aim limited partnerships 
as a result  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluated cmslp s investment in the subadvisory contracts for impairment 
our estimated future undiscounted cash flows from this investment were projected to be less than the book value of the investment as of december  as a result  we believed that cmslp s investment in the subadvisory contracts was impaired at december  we estimated the fair value of the investment using a discounted cash flow methodology 
we wrote down the value of cmslp s investment in the subadvisory contracts with the aim limited partnerships and recorded an impairment charge of approximately  as of december  in february  cmslp sold all of its rights and obligations under its cmbs master and direct servicing contracts primarily because the contracts were not profitable  given the relatively small volume of master and direct cmbs servicing that cmslp was performing 
in connection with this restructuring  employee positions were eliminated 
a restructuring charge of approximately  was recorded during the fourth quarter of to account for employee severance costs  non cancellable lease costs  and other costs related to the restructuring 
during  additional net restructuring expenses of approximately  were recorded primarily to account for vacant office space that is taking longer to sublease than originally anticipated 
cmslp received approximately million in cash  which included reimbursement of servicing advances  in connection with this sale 
total equity in losses earnings from investments for the years ended december  and includes our net equity from the aim limited partnerships which are four publicly traded limited partnerships that hold insured mortgages and whose general partner is one of our subsidiaries and the net equity from our limited partnership interest in the adviser to the aim limited partnerships during these periods  and includes net equity from cmslp cmsi for the six months ended june  since cmslp s operations are consolidated effective july  
in addition  as discussed below  the results include an impairment charge on our equity investment in the advisor to the aim limited partnerships 
on a comparative basis  the net equity from the aim limited partnerships decreased primarily due to a reduction in the aim limited partnerships mortgage assets 
as previously discussed  during  the aim limited partnerships experienced a significant amount of prepayments of their insured mortgages 
these prepayments reduced cash flows on our investment in the advisor to the aim limited partnerships 
as a result  in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 the advisor to the aim limited partnerships evaluated its investment in the advisory contracts for impairment 
the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from this investment were projected to be less than the book value of the investment as of december  as a result  the advisor believed that its investment in the advisory contracts was impaired at december  the advisor estimated the fair value of its investment using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the advisor wrote down the value of its investment in the advisory contracts to the aim limited partnerships and recorded an impairment charge 
we recorded our portion of the impairment charge  totaling approximately  as of december  this impairment charge is included in equity in losses earnings from investments in our consolidated statement of income 
this investment is included in our portfolio investment segment 
the following is a summary of our equity in losses earnings from investments year ended december  description equity in losses earnings from investments as presented on income statements aim limited partnerships net equity in earnings   impairment on investment in aim limited partnerships advisor  cmslp cmsi net equity in losses earnings  total equity in losses earnings from investments   income tax expense benefit during  we recorded a net income tax expense of approximately  during  we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately  during  approximately million of income tax expense was recognized as a result of the income taxes on the gain on the sale by cmslp of its cmbs master and direct servicing rights 
this tax expense of million was partially offset by tax refunds that were not previously accrued of approximately  that were recognized during the income tax expense was incurred by our trss that own the partnership interests in cmslp 
these trss are separately taxable entities that cannot use our net operating loss carryforward to reduce their taxable income 
the income tax benefit that was recognized by our trss during was the result of the net loss incurred by cmslp during the period july through december  other income other income decreased by approximately million to million during from million during this decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest income earned on reduced cash balances during as compared to  partially offset by an increase in net income before interest expense and depreciation expense from a shopping center that we account for as real estate owned  as discussed below 
in addition  we recognized approximately  and  in realized gains related to our trading of other mbs during and  respectively 
in october  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired certain partnership interests in a partnership that was the obligor on a mezzanine loan payable to us in exchange for curing a default on the first mortgage loan through a cash payment of approximately  this partnership and another of our wholly owned subsidiaries own of the partnership interests in the partnership which is the obligor on the first mortgage loan 
the first mortgage loan is secured by a shopping center in orlando  florida 
as a result of this acquisition  we own of the partnership interests and are consolidating the partnership s financial results as of october  we account for these assets as real estate owned  and the real estate is being held for investment 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized a net loss of approximately  and  respectively  from the operations of the shopping center  which includes approximately  and  of interest expense  respectively  and approximately  and  of depreciation expense  respectively 
the remaining net income expense of approximately  and  is included in other income in the consolidated statements of income during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we hope to reposition and stabilize this asset to increase its value  although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so 
net losses on mortgage security dispositions net losses on mortgage security dispositions were approximately  during compared to approximately  during during and  there were and nine loan prepayments  respectively 
in addition  losses of approximately  were recognized during following the final financial settlement on the two mortgages that were assigned to the us department of housing and urban development or hud in the original losses on these two mortgages that were assigned to hud were recognized during the net losses in and were primarily due to the write off of unamortized costs associated with the disposed mortgages at the disposition dates  partially offset by prepayment penalties  if applicable 
for any period  gains or losses on mortgage dispositions are based on the number  carrying amounts and proceeds of mortgages disposed of during the period 
impairment on cmbs impairment on cmbs increased by approximately million to million during compared to million during the paragraphs that follow discuss the impairment charges that were recorded during and the following table provides a summary of the changes in the overall expected loss estimates on subordinated cmbs from january  through december  overall impairment expected recorded during in millions loss estimate quarter ended impaired cmbs january  september  both bonds in cbo  and nomura unrated bond december  both bonds in cbo  and bb through unrated issuer s equity bonds in cbo june  nomura and cbo unrated issuer s equity bonds september  all unrated issuer s equity bonds  and the ccc bond and the b bond in cbo december  all unrated issuer s equity bonds  and the ccc bond and the b bond in cbo although the total amount of loans in special servicing only increased slightly from million as of december  to million as of december   the amount of estimated total mortgage loan defaults has increased  the projected loss severities of the underlying mortgage loans currently or anticipated to be in special servicing have increased and the timing of certain projected losses is anticipated to occur sooner than previously estimated  all of which has resulted in an increase in our overall expected loss estimate related to our subordinated cmbs portfolio to million as of december  as detailed in the table above 
the revision to the overall expected loss estimate is primarily the result of increased projected loan losses due to lower than anticipated appraisals and lower internal estimates of values on real estate owned by underlying trusts and properties underlying certain defaulted mortgage loans  which  when combined with the updated loss severity experience and increased expectation of defaults  has resulted in higher projected loss severities on mortgage loans and real estate owned by underlying trusts currently or anticipated to be in special servicing 
primary reasons for lower appraisals and lower estimates of value resulting in higher projected loss severities on mortgage loans include the poor performance of certain properties and related markets  failed workout negotiations  and extended time needed to liquidate assets due  in large part  to the continued softness in the economy  the continued downturn in travel and  in some cases  over supply of hotel properties  and a shift in retail activity in some markets  including the closing of stores by certain national and regional retailers 
in addition  two significant hotel portfolios transferred into special servicing in early january the unpaid principal balances of these two hotel portfolios aggregate approximately million 
for a further discussion of our significant hotel borrowing relationships  see summary of cmbs 
since we determined that there had been an adverse change in expected future cash flows  we believed some of our subordinated cmbs had been impaired under eitf and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as of december  as the fair values of the impaired subordinated cmbs aggregated approximately million  million and million below the amortized cost basis as of june   september  and december   respectively  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges through the income statement of these same amounts during the second  third and fourth quarters of during  we revised our overall expected loss estimate related to our subordinated cmbs portfolio as detailed in the table above 
the revisions to the overall expected loss estimate during were primarily the result of the continued slowing us economy and recession exacerbated by the terrorist attacks on september  and subsequent threats of terrorism  which were principal causes of greater than previously anticipated monetary defaults on the underlying mortgage loans and lower than previously anticipated appraisal amounts on properties underlying certain defaulted loans 
these factors increased the estimated principal loss on the mortgage loans 
as we determined that there had been an adverse change in expected future cash flows  we believed some of our subordinated cmbs had been impaired under eitf and sfas no 
as of september  and december  as the fair value of the impaired subordinated cmbs was approximately million and million below the amortized cost as of september  and december   respectively  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges through the income statement of these same amounts during the third and fourth quarters of there can be no assurance that our revised overall expected loss estimate of million will not be exceeded as a result of additional or existing adverse events or circumstances 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  the receipt of new or updated appraisals at lower than anticipated amounts  legal proceedings including bankruptcy filings involving borrowers  a continued weak economy or recession  an act of war  a delay in the disposition of specially serviced mortgage loans  additional defaults  losses occurring sooner than anticipated or an unforeseen reduction in expected recoveries  any of which could result in additional future credit losses and or further impairment to our subordinated cmbs  the effect of which could be materially adverse to us 
hedging loss and cumulative effect of adoption of fas during and  we recognized hedging expense through earnings of approximately million on our interest rate caps 
in addition  we recognized a  loss through earnings during due to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in april  we purchased an interest rate cap for approximately million 
this interest rate cap  which was effective on may   is for a notional amount of million  caps the one month london interbank offered rate  or libor  at and matures on november  the fair value of this cap has decreased by approximately  to approximately  since the purchase date 
this decrease is reflected in other comprehensive income and is attributable to a change in the expectation of future interest rates since the cap was purchased in april as of december   the one month libor rate was 
the fair value of the interest rate cap that was effective in april and matures in april has become worthless due to a decline in interest rates since the cap was purchased for million 
this cap is set at a one month libor rate of 
as of december   this interest rate cap was undesignated 
as a result  all future changes in the fair value will be recognized through current earnings in the consolidated statements of income 
as of december   the fair value of this interest rate cap was recapitalization expenses in connection with our january recapitalization  we incurred approximately million of transaction costs including amounts incurred in 
included in this total is approximately million of commitment fees  and investment banking  legal and tax professional fees directly associated with the bear stearns and bref transaction 
these costs will be allocated between debt and equity 
included in the total recapitalization expenses is approximately million of investment banking  legal and tax professional fees were incurred prior to our signing a letter of intent with bref in during our evaluation of strategic alternatives 
these amounts were expensed in included in the total costs of million are million of expenses which will be recognized in related to severance and related payments  and accelerated vesting of stock options for our former chairman  william b 
dockser  and former president  h 
william willoughby  whose employment contracts were terminated on january  as of december   we have approximately million of the aforementioned transaction costs included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet

this fee was required to be expensed immediately under gaap 
cumulative effect of adoption of sfas in june of  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
sfas no 
 which among other things  prohibits the amortization of existing goodwill and certain types of other intangible assets and establishes a new method of testing goodwill for impairment 
under sfas no 
 the method for testing goodwill for impairment occurs at the reporting unit level as defined in sfas no 
and is performed using a fair value based approach 
sfas no 
was effective for us on january  effective upon adoption on january   we wrote off this goodwill and recorded a resulting impairment charge of approximately million for this change in accounting principle 
the goodwill relates to the portfolio investment reporting unit as defined in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a market capitalization approach  and the impairment was primarily a result of the significant decrease in the price of our common stock price since the merger in this change in accounting principle reduced our annual amortization expense by approximately million 
the pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements present our net income and earnings per share as if this accounting principle had been applied to those periods presented 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to servicing revenue as discussed below  the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of million related to servicing revenue is reflected as of january  as an adjustment to net income and therefore is reflected in the year ended december  net income 
as of july   cmslp changed its accounting policy related to the recognition of special servicing fee revenue 
special servicing fees are paid to cmslp when mortgage loans collateralizing our cmbs are in default 
typically  cmslp is paid basis points of the unpaid principal balance of the defaulted mortgage loans for as long as the loans are in default 
the fees are paid to compensate the special servicer for managing and resolving the defaulted loan 
historically  cmslp had deferred special servicing fee revenue and recorded that revenue into earnings using the method consistent with our policy of recognizing interest income over the life of our cmbs on the level yield basis 
cmslp is now recording these special servicing fees in earnings on a current basis 
this change was made to better match revenues and expenses related to the actual special servicing of the defaulted loans 
the special servicing fees are paid on a current basis by the trusts holding the mortgage loans and those payments directly reduce the cash flow paid on our cmbs 
therefore  the special servicing fees paid are built into the gaap yields we use to record interest income on our cmbs 
cmslp changed its accounting policy to recognize the special servicing fees in earnings on a current basis as we believe this policy better matches the special servicing fees cmslp earns with the direct costs expended for performing its special servicing obligations 
the cmbs and special servicing contracts are separate legal instruments or contracts 
we were required to reflect this change in accounting principle as a cumulative catch up as of january  as of january   cmslp had approximately million in deferred revenue related to the special servicing fee revenue 
as a result  this amount was recorded in income and reflected as a cumulative change in accounting principle for the year ended december  the results of operations for the year ended december  reflect the recognition of special servicing fee revenue on a current basis 
as previously discussed  prior to july   cmslp was accounted for using the equity method and  as a result  the impact of the new accounting principle except for the cumulative catch up is reflected in equity in earnings losses from investments for the six months ended june  and on a consolidated basis for the six months ended december  the pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements present our net income and earnings per share as if this accounting principle had been applied to those periods presented 
net income would have been million less for the year ended december  had this new accounting principle not been adopted

the taxable income for the year ended december  has been increased by million to reflect the actual taxable income included on our income tax return  which was completed during results of operations compared to financial statement net loss to common shareholders for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the significant change in the results from was primarily the result of million of accounting impairment charges related to certain subordinated cmbs that were recognized during compared to impairment charges of million that were recognized during additionally  net loss to common shareholders for the year ended december  includes approximately million of net revenue due to the effect of changes in accounting principles and an aggregate of approximately million of expenses relating to the chapter reorganization

the effective interest method of recognizing interest income on subordinated cmbs results in income recognition that differs from cash received 
for the years ended december  and  the amount of income recognized in excess of cash received due to the effective interest rate method was approximately million and million  respectively 
interest income insured mortgage securities interest income from insured mortgage securities decreased by approximately million or to million for from million for this decrease was principally due to the prepayment of nine mortgage securities and the assignment to hud of two mortgage securities during these prepayments represented approximately of the total insured mortgage portfolio

for any period  gains or losses on mortgage dispositions are based on the number  carrying amounts and proceeds of mortgages disposed of during the period 
impairment on cmbs impairment of cmbs decreased by approximately million to million during compared to million during as of september   we revised our overall expected loss estimate related to our subordinated cmbs from million to million 
as of december   we again revised our overall expected loss estimate related to our subordinated cmbs from million to million over the life of the cmbs 
these revisions to loss estimates were primarily the result of the continued slowing us economy and recession  exacerbated by the terrorist attacks on september  and threats of subsequent terrorism 
principally as a result of these adverse factors  the underlying mortgage loans had a greater than previously anticipated number of monetary defaults during additionally  appraisal amounts on properties underlying certain defaulted loans were significantly lower than previously anticipated  thereby increasing the estimated principal loss on the commercial loans 
as we determined that there had been an adverse change in expected future cash flows  we believed some of our subordinated cmbs had been impaired under eitf and sfas no 
as of september  and december  as the fair value of the impaired cmbs was approximately million and million below the amortized cost as of september  and december   respectively  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges through the income statement of these same amounts during the third and fourth quarters of as of december   we revised our overall expected loss estimate related to our subordinated cmbs portfolio from million to million 
in addition  we expected such revised losses to occur sooner than originally expected because of the slowing us economy 
this revised loss estimate was a result of an increase in the number of loans that were placed in special servicing due primarily to loan defaults 
as we had determined that the current estimate of expected credit losses exceeded credit losses as previously projected  we believed our subordinated cmbs had been impaired under sfas no 
as the fair value of the impaired cmbs was million below the amortized cost basis as of december   we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge through the income statement of million during the fourth quarter of hedging loss and cumulative effect of adoption of fas during  we recognized hedging expense through earnings of approximately million on our interest rate cap and a  loss through earnings due to the adoption of sfas no 
litigation expense during  we recognized a million expense based on the settlement of the capital company of america  llc chapter claim related to a letter of intent in for the purchase of subordinated cmbs

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to servicing revenue the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of million related to servicing revenue is reflected as of january  as an adjustment to net income and therefore is reflected in the year ended december  net income

net operating loss for tax purposes 
we generated a net operating loss for tax purposes of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to a net operating loss of approximately million in as previously discussed  as a result of our trader election in early  we recognized a mark to market tax loss of approximately million on certain trading assets on january  the january loss is expected to be recognized evenly over four years    and for tax purposes ie  approximately million per year beginning with the year a summary of our and net operating losses for tax purposes is as follows in millions january  loss less amounts recognized in less amounts recognized in balance remaining of january  loss to be recognized in future periods taxable income for the year before recognition of january  loss less january  loss recognized plus mark to market unrealized loss gain on trading securities net operating loss for the year ended december accumulated net operating loss through january net operating loss created during the year ended december net operating loss utilization net operating loss carried forward for use in future periods taxable income for the year ended december  includes an approximate million loss on certain trading securities in connection with the transfer of certain trading securities on april  to cbo reit following the reorganization effected to facilitate the collateral structure for the exit debt 
assets transferred to cbo reit and subsequently transferred to cbo reit ii in january are no longer required to be marked to market on a tax basis 
the taxable income for the year ended december  has been increased by million to reflect the actual taxable income included on our income tax return  which was completed during cash flow compared to net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million during as compared to the increase was primarily attributable to net sales of other mbs during compared to net purchases during the results also reflect a decrease in restricted cash and accounts payable and accrued expenses following the settlement of the first union litigation in march the decrease in receivables and other assets reflects the january receipt of funds withheld related to our interest in cmo iv 
the results also reflect a decrease in restricted cash and accounts payable and accrued expenses caused by cash outflows on the april  chapter effective date  including approximately million to pay off accrued interest on debt incurred prior to the chapter filing  million to pay an emergence financing origination fee related to a portion of the exit debt and million to pay accrued payables related to the chapter filing 
net cash provided by investing activities increased by approximately million to million during compared to million during the increase was primarily attributable to o a million increase in proceeds from mortgage security prepayments during  o million of proceeds from the sale by cmslp of its servicing rights excludes reimbursement of advances  which are included in operating cash flows during  partially offset by o net cash of million that cmslp invested in investment grade cmbs during  and o million of cash reflected in as a result of the consolidation of cmslp beginning in july net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately million to million during compared to million during the decrease in cash used is primarily attributable to o a million decrease in principal payments on our recourse and other non match funded debt  including the exit debt  during  partially offset by o million paid to redeem the series e preferred stock  and o a million increase in principal payments on the securitized mortgage debt obligations due primarily to higher mortgage security dispositions in the principal payments on recourse debt include approximately million paid on the april  chapter effective date  which was used to pay off a portion of the aggregate principal relating to debt incurred prior to the chapter filing 
in march  we redeemed all  outstanding shares of the series e preferred stock at the stated redemption price of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends through and including the date of redemption 
the total redemption price was approximately million approximately  of which represented accrued and unpaid dividends 
the approximate million difference between the aggregate liquidation value and the redemption price is reflected as a dividend on preferred stock in the first quarter of the table below  which is not presented in accordance with gaap  is intended to provide a summary of cash available for debt service on recourse debt  dividends  acquisitions and general working capital purposes 
we believe that this information better facilitates an evaluation of our cash flows available for debt service on recourse debt  dividends  acquisitions and general working capital purposes 
we also believe the table is helpful in evaluating our recurring operating performance and our ability to fund liquidity internally 
the table below eliminates certain items which have the effect of reducing or increasing net loss before changes in accounting principles and dividends  but have no impact on cash available to us 
these items are attributable in large part to non cash income statement items  which are included in our consolidated statement of cash flows  as well as gaap net interest income or expense from our non recourse match funded debt associated with the investment grade cmbs and our insured mortgage securities 
in addition  we adjusted income provided by operating activities for cash distributions which are a return of investment received from the aim limited partnerships  our insured mortgage securities and cmbs 
the cash flows available for debt service on recourse debt  dividends  acquisitions and general working capital purposes presented below must first be used to service our recourse debt 
due to our nol carryforward  we are able to retain our net cash flows  after debt service  for payments of dividends  acquisitions and general working capital purposes 
the presentation of the financial measure addressed by the table below is different than the presentation included in previous periods 
we have changed our presentation to depict the reconciliation of this non gaap financial measure to the gaap net loss before accounting changes and preferred stock dividends

compared to net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million to million during compared to million during the increase was primarily due to a decrease in restricted cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in receivables and other assets  partially offset by a decrease in payables and accrued expenses 
receivables decreased primarily as a result of the receipt in january of funds withheld related to our interest in cmo iv 
the decrease in restricted cash and cash equivalents and the decrease in payables and accrued expenses were primarily caused by cash outflows on the april  chapter effective date  including approximately million to payoff accrued interest on debt incurred prior to the chapter filing  million to pay an emergence financing origination fee related to a portion of the exit debt and million to pay accrued payables related to the chapter filing 
net cash provided by investing activities decreased by approximately million to million during compared to million during the decrease was primarily attributable to o net proceeds of million received from the sale of cmbs during as part of our reorganization plan  o a million decrease in proceeds from originated loan disposition as all of our originated loans were sold in  o net proceeds of million received from the sale of cmo iv in as part of our reorganization plan  partially offset by o a million increase in the proceeds from insured mortgage securities prepayments during  and o a million decrease in principal payments from originated loans and insured mortgage securities following the sale of the originated loans during and prepayments of insured mortgage securities during net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately million to million during compared to million during the increase in cash used in was primarily attributable to o an outflow of cash of approximately million on the april  chapter effective date  which was used to payoff a portion of the aggregate principal relating to debt incurred prior to the chapter filing  and o a million increase in principal payments on the securitized mortgage debt obligations due primarily to higher mortgage security dispositions in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources limited summary of january recapitalization on january   we completed a recapitalization of all of the exit debt  which was funded with approximately million from common equity and secured subordinated debt issuances to bref  million in secured financing in the form of a repurchase transaction from bear stearns and a portion of our available cash and liquid assets 
this recapitalization increases our financial flexibility and provides new additions to management including barry s 
blattman  as chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and craig lieberman  as senior vice president and chief portfolio risk officer 
under this recently completed recapitalization  bref acquired  shares of our newly issued common stock  or approximately of our outstanding common stock after giving effect to the share acquisition  at per share  or approximately million 
bref also received seven year warrants to purchase up to  additional shares of common stock at per share 
bref also purchased million of the bref debt and  at our option  bref will purchase up to an additional million of subordinated debt prior to january  the bref debt matures on january  and bears interest at an annual rate of 
if we decide to sell the additional million of subordinated debt to bref  it will bear interest at an annual rate of and also matures on january  we have a right to defer two thirds of the interest on the bref debt and half on the additional million if sold to bref during its term 
the bref debt is secured by first liens on the equity interests of two of our subsidiaries 
although this effectively provides bref with an indirect lien on all of our subordinated cmbs that are held by three of our other lower tier subsidiaries  bear stearns has a first lien on the equity interests of these three lower tier subsidiaries and on certain of the subordinated cmbs held by one of these lower tier subsidiaries 
our obligations under the bref debt are contractually subordinate to the prior payment in full of our obligations under the million in secured financing provided by bear stearns 
there are contractual restrictions on bref s ability to realize upon its indirect interest in the bear stearns first lien collateral 
we paid an origination fee of to bref related to the bref debt 
we are also obligated to pay bref a quarterly maintenance fee of  in connection with arranging the bear stearns debt 
under this recently completed recapitalization  bear stearns provided million in secured financing in the form of a repurchase transaction the bear stearns debt 
the bear stearns debt matures in  bears interest at a rate equal to one month libor plus and requires quarterly principal payments of million 
the interest rate will increase to one month libor plus if a cdo is not completed within one year from the closing of the bear stearns debt 
in addition  the quarterly principal amortization will increase to million if a cdo is not completed by january  the bear stearns debt is secured by first direct and or indirect liens on all of our subordinated cmbs 
the indirect first liens are first liens on the equity interests of three of our subsidiaries that hold certain subordinated cmbs 
a reduction in the value of this collateral could require us to provide additional collateral or fund margin calls 
if the outstanding loan amount under the bear stearns debt exceeds of the aggregate market value of the collateral securing the bear stearns debt  as determined by bear stearns in its sole good faith discretion  then bear stearns can require us to transfer cash  cash equivalents or securities so that the outstanding loan amount will be less than or equal to of the aggregate market value of the collateral including any additional collateral provided 
failure to meet any margin call could result in an event of default which would enable bear stearns to exercise various rights and remedies including acceleration of the maturity date of the bear stearns debt and the sale of the collateral 
in order to meet a margin call  we may be required to sell assets at prices lower than their carrying value which could result in losses 
although criimi mae inc is not a primary obligor of the bear stearns debt  it has guaranteed the debt 
we paid a commitment fee of to bear stearns 
see also business certain risks borrowing and refinancing risks for a discussion of a possible cdo transaction and certain collateral requirements related to the bear stearns debt 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on a number of factors  including management s ability to maintain cash flow which is impacted by  among other things  the credit performance of the underlying mortgage loans and changes in interest rates and spreads and to generate capital internally from operating and investing activities and expected reductions in reit distribution requirements to shareholders due to net operating losses for tax purposes  in each case consistent with the terms and conditions of the operative documents evidencing the bear stearns and bref debt 
there can be no assurance that targeted levels of cash flow will actually be achieved  that reductions in reit distribution requirements will be realized  or that  if required  new capital will be available to us 
our ability to maintain or increase cash flow and access new capital will depend upon  among other things  interest rates including hedging costs and margin calls  prevailing economic conditions  restrictions under the operative documents evidencing the bear stearns and bref debt  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our cash flow will also be negatively affected by realized losses  interest payment shortfalls and appraisal reduction amounts on properties related to mortgages underlying our subordinated cmbs 
we expect losses on our cmbs to increase in  resulting in decreased cmbs cash flows as compared to our cash flows are also likely to decrease as a result of any prepayments of mortgage loans underlying our insured mortgage securities and any prepayments of mortgages held by the aim limited partnerships 
prepayments of these mortgage loans will result in reductions in the respective mortgage bases 
as a result  the net cash flows to us are likely to decrease over time 
our net cash flows will also decrease due to the failure to close the cdo transaction prior to january  or if we refinance the bear stearns debt with debt which has a higher interest rate and or greater amortization requirements 
cash flows are also likely to be affected if we incur further debt to acquire additional cmbs or for other corporate purposes 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our high level of debt limits our ability to obtain additional capital  significantly reduces income available for other activities  restricts our ability to react quickly to changes in our business  limits our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities  and makes us more vulnerable to economic downturns 
our ability to make mortgage related investments and acquisitions depends  among other things  on our ability to engage in such activities under the terms and conditions of the operative debt documents  our internally generated cash flows  and our ability to access additional capital 
factors which could affect our ability to access additional capital include  among other things  the cost and availability of such capital  the availability of investment product at attractive rates of return  changes in interest rates and interest rate spreads  changes in the commercial mortgage industry and the commercial real estate market  the effects of terrorism  general economic conditions  perceptions in the capital markets of our business  restrictions under the operative debt documents  results of our operations  and our financial leverage  financial condition  and business prospects 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to resume any of our prior activities or obtain additional capital  or that the terms of any such capital will be favorable to us 
limited summary of chapter reorganization plan including exit debt our chapter reorganization plan effective april provided for the payment in full of all of our allowed claims primarily through chapter recapitalization financing including proceeds from certain asset sales totaling million 
the sales of select cmbs and the sale of our interest in cmo iv  a securitization transaction  generated proceeds of approximately million toward the recapitalization financing  of which approximately million was used to pay related borrowings and approximately million was used to help fund our reorganization plan 
included in the balance of the recapitalization financing was approximately million in exit debt provided by affiliates of merrill lynch and gacc through the exit variable rate secured borrowing  in the form of a repurchase transaction  and approximately million in exit debt provided through two new series of senior secured notes issued to some of our unsecured creditors 
as of june   all rights and obligations of merrill lynch and gacc under the exit variable rate secured borrowing operative agreements were assigned to orix capital markets  llc 
all exit debt  described in further detail below  was paid off in connection with the january  recapitalization 
the approximate million original principal amount exit variable rate secured borrowing provided for i interest at a rate of one month libor plus payable monthly  ii principal repayment amortization obligations  including  without limitation  a requirement to pay down an aggregate million in principal by april  the failure to pay down this amount would not have constituted an event of default but would have resulted in the continuation or reinstatement of certain restrictions and additional restrictions  iii extension fees of of the unpaid principal balance payable at the end of   and months after the chapter effective date and iv maturity on april  assuming we exercised our options to extend the maturity date of the debt 
the approximate million fixed rate secured financing was effected through the issuance of two series of secured notes under two separate indentures 
the series a senior secured notes  representing an aggregate original principal amount of million  provided for i interest at a rate of per annum payable monthly  ii principal repayment amortization obligations  including  without limitation  a principal payment obligation of million due april  the failure to make this payment would not have constituted an event of default but would have resulted in a basis point increase in the interest rate on the unpaid principal amount if certain miscellaneous collateral was not sold or otherwise disposed of  iii extension fees of of the unpaid principal balance payable at the end of  and months after the chapter effective date and iv maturity on april  the series b senior secured notes  representing an aggregate original principal amount of approximately million  provided for i interest at a rate of per annum payable semi annually with additional interest at the rate of per annum accreting over the debt term  ii extension fees of of the unpaid principal balance payable at the end of  and months after the chapter effective date with the payment months after the bankruptcy effective date also including an amount based on the unpaid principal balance months after the bankruptcy effective date and iii maturity on april  the exit debt described above was secured directly or indirectly by substantially all of our assets 
there were restrictive covenants  including financial covenants and certain restrictions and requirements with respect to cash accounts and the collection  management  use and application of funds in connection with the exit debt 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the exit debt 
the terms of the exit debt significantly restricted the amount of cash dividends that could be paid to shareholders 
one restriction provided that if total realized losses and appraisal reduction amounts on properties related to mortgage loans underlying our subordinated cmbs  as determined under the exit debt operative documents  exceeded certain loss thresholds  then we were prohibited from paying cash dividends or making other cash distributions or payments to shareholders  except as required to maintain reit status 
as of december  and december   total realized losses and appraisal reduction amounts had exceeded the loss threshold amounts under the applicable exit debt operative documents 
exceeding such loss threshold amounts resulted in restrictions on the acquisition of cmbs rated b or lower or unrated 
additional restrictions included restrictions on the use of proceeds from our equity investments and specified cash flows from certain assets acquired after the chapter effective date 
summary of cash position and shareholders equity as of december   our restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents aggregated approximately million  including cash and cash equivalents of approximately million held by cmslp 
in addition to our cash  we had additional liquidity at december  comprised of a million gnma mortgage backed security  million in other mbs and million of investment grade cmbs owned by cmslp  all of which are included elsewhere in our balance sheet 
after giving effect to the january recapitalization  the related retirement of the exit debt  and operations thru mid march  our total liquidity was approximately million at march  as of december  and  shareholders equity was approximately million or per diluted share and approximately million or per diluted share  respectively 
after giving effect to the redemption of the series e preferred stock and the first union settlement which occurred in march  our pro forma book value per diluted share would have been as of december  these diluted book value per share amounts are based on shareholders equity presented in accordance with gaap 
these amounts include  among other things  the net assets related to our cmbs rated a through bbb  which we do not actually own  but they are required by gaap to be included on our balance sheet see summary of cmbs below for a further discussion 
these cmbs are reflected at fair value and the related match funded debt at amortized cost  in each case in accordance with gaap 
the increase in the diluted book value per share is primarily attributable to an overall increase in the total fair value of our cmbs and insured mortgage securities primarily due to a decrease in long term interest rates and tighter spreads on certain cmbs as of december  compared to december   partially offset by the net loss to common shareholders of approximately million for the year ended december  summary of cmbs as of december   we owned  in accordance with gaap  cmbs excludes other mbs with an aggregate face amount of approximately billion rated from a to ccc and unrated 
such cmbs had an aggregate fair value of approximately million representing approximately of our total consolidated assets and an aggregate amortized cost of approximately million 
such cmbs represent investments in securities issued in connection with criimi mae trust i series c or cbo  criimi mae commercial mortgage trust series c or cbo and nomura asset securities corporation series d or nomura 
the following is a summary of the ratings of our cmbs as of december  rating fair value of cmbs a  bbb or bbb a bb  bb or bb b  b  b or ccc unrated a represents investment grade cmbs that we reflect as assets on our balance sheet as a result of cbo as indicated in footnote to the table below  gaap requires both these assets reflected as cmbs pledged to secure securitized mortgage obligation cmbs and their related liabilities reflected as collateralized bond obligations cmbs to be reflected on our balance sheet 
all cash flows related to the investment grade cmbs are used to service the corresponding debt 
as a result  we currently receive no cash flows from the investment grade cmbs 
as of december   the weighted average interest rate and the loss adjusted weighted average life based on face amount of the investment grade securities was and years  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate and the loss adjusted weighted average life based on face amount of the bb through unrated cmbs securities  sometimes referred to as the retained portfolio  were and years  respectively

as of december   the fair values of the b  ccc and the unrated issuer s equity in nomura  cbo  and cbo were derived solely from interest cash flow anticipated to be received since our current loss expectation assumes that the full principal amount of these securities will not be recovered 
see also advance limitations  appraisal reductions and losses on cmbs below 
as of december   the subordinated cmbs from cbo and cbo with the exception of the cbo issuer s equity which has no stated coupon rate have stated coupon rates of and  respectively  while the weighted average net coupon rates of the cmbs underlying cbo and cbo are approximately and  respectively prior to the consideration of losses  prepayments and extensions on the underlying mortgage loans 
the subordinated cmbs experience interest shortfalls when the weighted average net coupon rate on the underlying cmbs is less than the weighted average stated coupon payments on the subordinated cmbs 
such interest shortfalls will continue to accumulate until they i are repaid through excess interest and or recoveries on the underlying cmbs or ii are realized as a loss of principal on the subordinated cmbs 
based on our overall expected loss estimate as of december   the cbo subordinated cmbs currently rated b and ccc and the nomura unrated cmbs are expected to incur approximately million  million  and million  respectively  of losses directly attributable to accumulated and unpaid interest shortfalls over their expected lives 
such anticipated losses and shortfalls have been taken into consideration in the calculations of fair market values and yields to maturity used to recognize interest income as of december  the unrated subordinated cmbs from cbo currently does not have a stated coupon rate since these securities are only entitled to the residual cash flow payments  if any  remaining after paying the securities with a higher payment priority 
as a result  effective coupon rates on these securities are highly sensitive to the effective coupon rates and monthly cash flow payments received from the underlying cmbs that represent the collateral for cbo in connection with cbo  million originally a rated  currently a rated and million originally bbb rated  currently bbb rated face amount of investment grade cmbs were sold with call options and million originally a rated  currently a rated face amount were sold without call options 
also in connection with cbo  in may  we initially retained million originally bbb rated  currently bbb rated and million originally bbb rated  currently bbb rated face amount of cmbs  both with call options  with the intention to sell these cmbs at a later date 
such sale occurred march  since we retained call options on certain sold cmbs the a  bbb and bbb bonds  we did not surrender control of these cmbs pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
and thus these cmbs are accounted for as a financing and not a sale 
since the transaction is recorded as a partial financing and a partial sale  we have retained these cmbs with call options and reflected them in our subordinated cmbs on the balance sheet to which we currently receive no economic benefit 
amortized cost reflects impairment charges of approximately million related to the unrated issuer s equity bonds  the ccc bond and the b bond in cbo  which were recognized during the year ended december  these impairment charges are in addition to the cumulative impairment charges of approximately million that were recognized through december  the impairment charges are discussed in results of operations 
amortized cost reflects approximately million of cumulative impairment charges related to certain cmbs all cmbs except those rated a and bbb  which were recognized through december  see business certain risk factors risk of loss of reit status and other tax matters for information regarding the subordinated cmbs for tax purposes 
as of december   the aggregate fair values of the cbo  cbo and nomura bonds were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the discount rate is applied to gross scheduled cash flows as opposed to loss adjusted cash flows for purposes of calculating fair values 
as a result of the significant loss of principal on these cmbs  we have used a significantly high discount rate to determine a reasonable fair value of these cmbs 
the weighted average yield to maturity of the ccc and unrated issuer s equity is and  respectively 
determination of fair value of cmbs our determination of fair values for our cmbs portfolio is a subjective process 
the process begins with the compilation and evaluation of pricing information such as nominal spreads to us treasury securities or nominal yields that  in our view  is commensurate with the market s perception of value and risk of comparable assets 
we use a variety of sources to compile such pricing information including i recent offerings and or secondary trades of comparable cmbs ie  securities comparable to our cmbs or to the cmbs or collateral underlying our cmbs issued in connection with cbo and cbo  ii communications with dealers and active cmbs investors regarding the pricing and valuation of comparable securities  iii institutionally available research reports  iv analyses prepared by the nationally recognized rating organizations responsible for the initial rating assessment and on going surveillance of such cmbs  and v other qualitative and quantitative factors that may impact the value of the cmbs such as the market s perception of the issuers of the cmbs and the credit fundamentals of the commercial properties securing each pool of commercial mortgage loans 
we make further fair value adjustments to such pricing information  which is then used to determine the fair value of our cmbs using a discounted cash flow approach 
expected future gross cash flows are discounted at market yields for our rated cmbs  depending on the rating  and at a fixed discount rate for our unrated issuer s equity 
furthermore  the fair value for those cmbs incurring principal losses and interest shortfalls ie  cbo b and ccc bonds  and our unrated issuer s equity based on our overall expected loss estimate are valued at a loss adjusted yield to maturity that  in our view  is commensurate with the market s perception of value and risk of comparable securities  using the same discounted cash flow approach 
such anticipated principal losses and interest shortfalls have been taken into consideration in the calculation of fair market values and yields to maturity used to recognize interest income as of december  in addition  we considered the impact of our recent recapitalization and the value of competing offers in determining our year end fair values 
since we calculated the estimated fair value of our cmbs as of december  and  we have disclosed the range of discount rates by rating category used in determining the fair values as of december  in the table above 
the liquidity of the subordinated cmbs market has historically been limited 
additionally  during adverse market conditions  the liquidity of such market has been severely limited 
for this reason  among others  management s estimate of the value of our subordinated cmbs could vary significantly from the value that could be realized in a current transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller in other than a forced sale or liquidation 
mortgage loan pool through cmslp  we perform servicing functions on commercial mortgage loans underlying our cmbs totaling billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
the mortgage loans underlying our subordinated cmbs are secured by properties of the types and in the geographic locations identified below property type percentage i percentage i geographic location ii percentage i percentage i retail retail multifamily multifamily hotel hotel office office other iv iv other iii total total i based on a percentage of the total unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans 
ii no significant concentration by region 
iii no other individual state makes up more than of the total 
iv our ownership interest in one of the cmbs transactions underlying cbo includes subordinated cmbs in which our exposure to losses arising from certain healthcare and senior housing mortgage loans is limited by other subordinated cmbs referred to herein as the subordinated healthcare senior housing cmbs 
these other subordinated cmbs are not owned by us and are subordinate to our cmbs in this transaction 
as a result  our investment in such underlying cmbs will only be affected if interest shortfalls and or realized losses on such healthcare and senior housing mortgage loans are in excess of the other subordinated cmbs not owned by us 
specially serviced mortgage loans cmslp performs special servicing on the loans underlying our subordinated cmbs 
a special servicer typically provides asset management and resolution services with respect to nonperforming or underperforming loans within a pool of mortgage loans 
when serving as special servicer of a mortgage loan pool  cmslp has the authority  subject to certain restrictions in the applicable cmbs pooling and servicing documents  to deal directly with any borrower that fails to perform under certain terms of its mortgage loan  including the failure to make payments  and to manage any loan workouts and foreclosures 
as special servicer  cmslp earns fee income on services provided in connection with any loan servicing function transferred to it from the master servicer 
we believe that because we own over a majority of and in almost all cases of the first loss unrated or lowest rated bond of all but two of the cmbs transactions underlying our subordinated cmbs  cmslp has an incentive to efficiently and effectively resolve any loan workouts 
as of december  and  specially serviced mortgage loans included in the commercial mortgage loans described above are as follows specially serviced loans due to monetary default a million million specially serviced loans due to covenant default other million million total specially serviced loans b million million percentage of total mortgage loans b a includes million and million  respectively  of real estate owned by underlying trusts 
see also the table below regarding property type concentrations for further information on real estate owned by underlying trusts 
b as of february   total specially serviced loans were approximately billion  or of the total mortgage loans 
see discussion below for additional information regarding specially serviced loans 
the specially serviced mortgage loans as of december  were secured by properties of the types and located in the states identified below property type in millions percentage geographic location in millions percentage hotel hotel retail retail multifamily multifamily healthcare healthcare office georgia office industrial north industrial other other total total approximately million of these loans in special servicing are real estate owned by underlying trusts 
approximately million of these loans in special servicing are real estate owned by underlying trusts 
as reflected above  as of december   approximately million  or  of the specially serviced mortgage loans are secured by mortgages on hotel properties 
the hotel properties that secure the mortgage loans underlying our subordinated cmbs are geographically diverse  with a mix of hotel property types and franchise affiliations 
the following table summarizes the hotel mortgage loans underlying our subordinated cmbs as of december  total outstanding percentage of amount in principal balance total hotel loans special servicing full service hotels billion million limited service hotels billion million totals billion million limited service hotels are generally hotels with room only operations or hotels that offer a bedroom and bathroom  but limited other amenities  and are often in the budget or economy group 
full service hotels are generally mid price  upscale or luxury hotels with restaurant and lounge facilities and other amenities 
of the million of hotel loans in special servicing as of december   approximately million  or  relate to four borrowing relationships more fully described as follows o sixteen loans and eight real estate owned properties with scheduled principal balances totaling approximately million spread across four cmbs transactions secured by hotel properties throughout the us as of december   our total exposure  including advances  on these loans is approximately million 
in one of these cmbs transactions  which contains loans with scheduled principal balances totaling million  we hold only a ownership interest in the non rated class 
in the other three cmbs transactions  we hold a ownership interest in the non rated class 
twenty five loans were transferred into special servicing in december due to the bankruptcy filing of each special purpose borrowing entity and their parent company 
since the bankruptcy filing  as part of a consensual plan  eight properties with scheduled principal balances totaling million have become real estate owned by underlying trusts  one loan with a scheduled principal balance totaling million has been paid in full and the remaining sixteen loans with scheduled principal balances totaling million were granted maturity date extensions and have been returned to performing status  and are in the process of being transferred out of special servicing 
o twenty seven loans with scheduled principal balances totaling approximately million spread across three cmbs transactions secured by hotel properties in the west and pacific northwest states 
as of december   our total exposure  including advances  on these loans is approximately million 
the borrower had filed for bankruptcy protection in october the borrower has indicated that the properties have experienced reduced operating performance due to new competition  the economic recession  and reduced travel resulting from the september  terrorist attacks 
we have entered into a consensual settlement agreement dated february  pursuant to which the loan terms will be amended and modified 
the parties are currently proceeding toward closing a comprehensive loan modification that should return the loans to performing status 
o five loans with scheduled principal balances totaling approximately million secured by hotel properties in florida and texas 
as of december   our total exposure  including advances  on these loans is approximately million 
the loans are past due for the july and all subsequent payments 
the balance and paid through date do not reflect the recent application in of approximately million of insurance proceeds and of sporadic payments received from the borrower throughout the year 
the borrower and lender have entered into negotiations concerning a consensual modification of the loan terms 
o nine loans with scheduled principal balances totaling approximately million secured by limited service hotels in midwestern states 
as of december   our total exposure  including advances  on these loans is approximately million 
the loans are past due for the april and all subsequent payments 
the borrower cites reduced occupancy related to the recent downturn in travel as the cause for a drop in operating performance at the properties 
cmslp was attempting to negotiate a workout with the borrower  but the borrower filed for bankruptcy protection in february in addition to the borrowing relationships described above  subsequent to december  there were the following two additional transfers to special servicing of large hotel loans  one for an imminent payment default and the other for a non monetary default 
these defaults were considered in our december  loss assessment 
o one loan with a scheduled principal balance totaling approximately million secured by extended stay hotels located throughout the country 
this loan was transferred to special servicing in january due to the borrower s request for forbearance and the resulting possibility of an imminent payment default 
in its request  the borrower cited continuing reduced operating performance at its hotel properties  which it did not expect to improve in the foreseeable future 
cmslp entered into a short term forbearance agreement with the borrower  and a consensual term sheet to restructure and modify the loan terms 
we recently closed a loan modification agreement with the borrower that is expected to return the loan to performing status in the future 
o one loan with a scheduled principal balance totaling approximately million  secured by limited service hotels located in states 
the loan was transferred to special servicing in january the loan is current for payments  but was transferred to special servicing due to the unauthorized leasing of some of the collateral properties by the borrower  and unapproved franchise changes by the borrower  among other reasons 
we have entered into a confidentiality and pre negotiation agreement in an attempt to reach a consensual resolution of this matter 
for each of the borrowing relationships described in the paragraphs above  we believe that we have adequate reserves for losses that we may incur in the future 
there can be no assurance that the losses incurred in the future will not exceed our current reserves see discussion below regarding increase in loss estimates 
the following table provides a summary of the change in the balance of specially serviced loans from december  to december  in millions specially serviced loans  december  transfers in due to monetary default transfers in due to covenant default and other transfers out of special servicing loan amortization specially serviced loans  december  represents the reduction of the scheduled principal balances due to advances made by the master servicers 
specially serviced loans total approximately billion as of february  for all loans in special servicing  cmslp is pursuing remedies available to it in order to maximize the recovery of the outstanding debt 
see exhibit o to this annual report on form k for a detailed listing of all specially serviced loans underlying our subordinated cmbs as of december  advance limitations  appraisal reductions and losses on cmbs we experience shortfalls in expected cash flow on our cmbs prior to the recognition of a realized loss primarily due to servicing advance limitations to the most subordinate securities only in certain underlying cmbs transactions or appraisal reductions 
the servicing advance limitations permit the master servicer in those certain underlying cmbs transactions to make only one principal and interest advance with regard to a delinquent mortgage loan 
thereafter  no future monthly principal and interest advances will be made by the master servicer until the amount of the most subordinate cmbs current coupon is eliminated 
this restriction is enforced until an appraisal reduction has been determined or the loan payments are brought current 
the appraisal reduction generally requires the master servicer to stop advancing interest payments on the amount by which the sum of unpaid principal balance of the loan  advances and other expenses exceeds in most cases of the appraisal amount  thus reducing our cash flows as the holder of the first loss unrated or lowest rated bonds  as if such appraisal reduction was a realized loss 
for example  assuming a weighted average coupon of  a million appraisal reduction would reduce our net cash flows by  on an annual basis 
an appraisal reduction may result in a higher or lower realized loss based on the ultimate disposition or work out of the mortgage loan 
appraisal reductions for the cmbs transactions in which we retain an ownership interest as reported by the underlying trustees or as calculated by cmslp were as follows in thousands cbo cbo nomura total year    year    year     cumulative appraisal reductions through december      not all underlying cmbs transactions require the calculation of an appraisal reduction  however  when cmslp obtains a third party appraisal  it calculates one 
as previously discussed  certain bonds from the cbo  cbo and nomura transactions are expected to experience principal write downs over their expected lives 
the following tables summarize the actual realized losses on our cmbs through december  including realized mortgage loan losses expected to pass through to our cmbs during the next month and the expected future losses through the life of the cmbs in thousands cbo cbo nomura total year actual realized losses year actual realized losses    year actual realized losses   year actual realized losses    cumulative actual realized losses through december     cumulative actual realized losses through december     expected loss estimates for the year     expected loss estimates for the years     expected loss estimates for the years     expected loss estimates for the years     expected loss estimates for the years     expected loss estimates for the remaining life of cmbs     cumulative expected loss estimates including cumulative actual realized losses through life of cmbs     we revised our overall expected loss estimate related to our subordinated cmbs from million as of december  to million as of june  to million as of september  to million as of december   with such total losses occurring or expected to occur through the life of the subordinated cmbs 
these revisions to the overall expected loss estimate were primarily the result of increased mortgage loan defaults and increased projected losses and assuming the related timing of losses will occur sooner than previously estimated due to lower than anticipated appraisals and lower internal estimates of values on real estate owned by underlying trusts and properties underlying certain defaulted mortgage loans  which  when combined with the updated loss severity experience  has resulted in higher projected loss severities on loans and real estate owned by underlying trusts currently or anticipated to be in special servicing 
primary reasons for lower appraisals and lower estimates of value resulting in higher projected loss severities on mortgage loans include the poor performance of certain properties and related markets  failed workout negotiations  and extended time needed to liquidate assets due  in large part  to the continued softness in the economy  the continued downturn in travel and  in some cases  over supply of hotel properties  and a shift in retail activity in some markets  including the closing of stores by certain national and regional retailers 
in addition  as previously discussed  two significant hotel loan portfolios transferred into special servicing in january the unpaid principal balances of these two hotel loan portfolios aggregate approximately million 
our overall expected loss estimate of million through the life of our subordinated cmbs includes our estimate of total principal write downs to our subordinated cmbs due to realized losses related to underlying mortgage loans  and is included in the calculation of the current weighted average anticipated yield to maturity  as discussed below 
there can be no assurance that our revised overall expected loss estimate of million will not be exceeded as a result of additional or existing adverse events or circumstances 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  the receipt of new or updated appraisals at lower than anticipated amounts  legal proceedings including bankruptcy filings involving borrowers  a continued weak economy or recession  an act of war  a delay in the disposition of specially serviced mortgage loans  additional defaults  or an unforeseen reduction in expected recoveries  any of which could result in additional future credit losses and or further impairment to our subordinated cmbs  the effect of which could be materially adverse to us 
at september   we revised our overall expected loss estimate related to our subordinated cmbs from million to million and  as of december   we further revised our overall expected loss estimate from million to million  with such total losses occurring or expected to occur over the life of the subordinated cmbs 
the revisions to loss estimates during were primarily the result of the continued slowing us economy and recession  exacerbated by the terrorist attacks on september  and threats of subsequent terrorism 
as previously discussed  principally as a result of these adverse factors  the underlying mortgage loans had a greater than previously anticipated number of monetary defaults during additionally  appraisal amounts on properties underlying certain defaulted loans were significantly lower than previously anticipated  thereby increasing the estimated principal loss on the commercial loans 
see impairment on cmbs for a discussion of the impairment charges recognized during  and yield to maturity the following table summarizes yield to maturity information relating to our cmbs on an aggregate pool basis current anticipated anticipated anticipated yield to yield to yield to maturity maturity maturity pool as of as of as of cbo cmbs cbo cmbs nomura cmbs weighted average represents the anticipated weighted average yield over the expected average life of the cmbs as of january   january   and january  based on our estimate of the timing and amount of future credit losses 
as previously discussed  as of december   september   december   june   september  and december   we revised our overall expected loss estimate related to our subordinated cmbs to million  million  million  million  million and million  respectively  which resulted in impairment recognition to certain subordinated cmbs 
as a result of recognizing impairment  we revised the anticipated yields as of january   october   january   july   october  and january   which were or are  in the case of revised anticipated yields as of january   used to recognize interest income beginning on each of those dates 
these anticipated revised yields took into account the lower cost basis due to the impairment recognized on the subordinated cmbs as of dates the losses were revised  and contemplated larger than previously anticipated losses that were generally expected to occur sooner than previously anticipated 
the weighted average yield to maturity was and as of july  and october   respectively 
gaap requires that the income on subordinated cmbs be recorded based on the effective interest method using the anticipated yield over the expected life of these mortgage assets 
this method can result in accounting income recognition which is greater than or less than cash received 
for the years ended december   and  the amount of income recognized in excess of cash received on all of the subordinated cmbs due to the effective interest rate method was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
sensitivity of fair value to changes in the discount rate the required rate of return used to determine the fair value of our subordinated cmbs is comprised of many variables  such as a risk free rate  a liquidity premium and a credit risk premium 
these variables are combined to determine a total rate that  when used to discount the subordinated cmbs s assumed stream of future cash flows  results in a net present value of such cash flows 
the determination of such rate is dependent on many quantitative and qualitative factors  such as  but not limited to  the market s perception of the issuers of the subordinated cmbs and the credit fundamentals of the commercial properties underlying each pool of commercial mortgage loans 
if we assumed that the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our cmbs a through unrated bonds increased by basis points  the increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the value of our cmbs a through unrated bonds by approximately million or as of december  the basis point increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the value of our subordinated cmbs bb through unrated bonds by approximately million or as of december  this sensitivity is hypothetical and should be used with caution 
changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the subordinated cmbs is calculated without changing any other assumption  in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  increases in market interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
summary of other assets portfolio investment as of december  and  our other assets consisted primarily of insured mortgage securities  equity investments  other mortgage backed securities  cash and cash equivalents as previously discussed  principal and interest receivables and real estate owned 
we had million and million at fair value invested in insured mortgage securities as of december  and  respectively 
the reduction in fair value is primarily attributable to the prepayment of insured mortgages which had fair values of million at december   partially offset by the effect of lower interest rates on the market value of the insured mortgage securities 
as of december   of our investment in insured mortgage securities were gnma mortgage backed securities and approximately were fha insured certificates 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
included in equity investments are a the general partnership interests to ownership interests in the aim limited partnerships  and b a limited partnership interest in the advisor to the aim limited partnerships 
the decrease in these investments is primarily the result of partner distributions declared by the aim limited partnerships during due to loan pay offs and normal cash flow distributions and impairment of approximately  that we recognized on our investment in the advisor to the aim limited partnerships during see discussion in mortgage servicing equity in losses income from investments 
the carrying values of our equity investments are expected to continue to decline over time as the aim limited partnerships asset bases decrease and proceeds are distributed to partners 
our other mbs include primarily investment grade cmbs and investment grade residential mortgage backed securities 
as of december  and  the fair values of our other mbs were approximately million and million  respectively 
in october  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries acquired certain partnership interests in a partnership that was the obligor on a mezzanine loan payable to us in exchange for curing a default on the first mortgage loan through a cash payment of approximately  this partnership and another of our wholly owned subsidiaries own of the partnership interests in the partnership which is the obligor on the first mortgage loan 
the first mortgage loan is secured by a shopping center in orlando  florida 
as a result of this acquisition  we own of the partnership interests and are consolidating the partnership s financial results as of october  we account for these assets as real estate owned  and the real estate is being held for investment 
the mezzanine loan payable is eliminated in consolidation 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in real estate owned assets included in other assets million and million  respectively  relating to the actual building and land 
in addition  we had million and million of mortgage payable net of discount related to the real estate as of december  and  respectively 
we hope to reposition and stabilize this asset to increase its value  although there can be no assurance we will be able to do so 
as discussed previously  million of our goodwill and intangible assets related to the merger were written off on january  upon the adoption of sfas no 
mortgage servicing as of december   cmslp s other assets consisted primarily of investments in liquid  investment grade cmbs  advances receivable  fixed assets  investments in interest only strips and investments in subadvisory contracts 
as of december   cmslp s other assets consisted primarily of advances receivable  investments in mortgage servicing rights  fixed assets  investments in interest only strips and investments in subadvisory contracts 
the servicing other assets have decreased by approximately million from million at december  to million at december  the decrease is primarily the result of o a million decrease in investments in mortgage servicing rights and a million decrease in advances receivable following the sale of the cmbs servicing rights  and o a  decrease in aim limited partnerships subadvisory contracts due to the decreasing mortgage base being serviced for the aim limited partnerships by cmslp and the impairment that was recognized on cmslp s investment in the subadvisory contracts see discussion in mortgage servicing equity in losses income from investments  partially offset by o the purchase of liquid  investment grade cmbs during  which have a fair value of approximately million as of december  summary of liabilities portfolio investment as of december  and  our liabilities consisted primarily of debt  accrued interest and accrued payables 
total recourse debt decreased by approximately million to million as of december  from million as of december  due to principal repayments of million during  partially offset by interest accretion of million on the series b senior secured notes 
total non recourse debt decreased by approximately million to million as of december  from million as of december  this decrease is primarily attributable to significant prepayments of mortgages underlying the insured mortgage securities during  which resulted in a corresponding reduction in the principal balances of the securitized mortgage obligations 
our payables and accrued liabilities increased by approximately  to million as of december  from million as of december  primarily as a result of a million increase in accrued interest and extension fees on the exit debt and a million increase in dividends payable due to the deferral of the second  third and fourth quarter preferred stock dividends  partially offset by a million decrease in payables following the settlement of the litigation with first union national bank in march mortgage servicing as of december  and  cmslp s liabilities consisted primarily of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the liabilities as of december  also included a payable for a line of credit that was used by cmslp to fund property protection advances as a master servicer 
the servicing liabilities decreased by approximately million to  as of december  from million as of december  the decrease is primarily the result of the repayment of the million line of credit for property protection advances following the sale of servicing rights in february the remaining decrease is the result of reduced normal operations following the sale of the servicing rights and the resulting reduction in staff 
subsequent events as previously discussed in limited summary of january recapitalization  bref acquired  shares of our newly issued common stock  or approximately of our outstanding common stock after giving effect to the share acquisition  at per share  or approximately million 
bref also received seven year warrants to purchase up to  additional shares of common stock at per share 
the fair value of the warrants was calculated as approximately million 
the assumptions we used to value the warrants are consistent with the assumptions used to value our stock options 
the warrants will be accounted for as a component of equity 
bref also purchased million of the bref debt and  at our option  bref will purchase up to an additional million of subordinated debt prior to january  bear stearns provided million in secured financing in the form of a repurchase transaction 
on the date of our recent january recapitalization  we effected an affiliate reorganization principally to indirectly secure the bear stearns debt with the equity interests in cbo and cbo as a result of the affiliate reorganization  our reit subsidiary cbo reit ii  owns all securities previously pledged to secure the exit debt and indirectly owns all of the equity interests in cbo and cbo through its ownership of the two qualified reit subsidiaries which hold the equity interests in cbo and cbo 
in connection with the recapitalization  we expect to recognize certain amounts in our consolidated statement of income during the first quarter of these amounts include the following o on january  and in connection with the closing of the recapitalization  amounts were deposited with the indenture trustee to pay all principal and interest on our outstanding series a and series b senior secured notes on the march  redemption date 
this redemption required days prior notice 
these notes were not considered repaid for gaap purposes until the march  redemption date 
the day notice period resulted in additional interest expense during the period january  through march  since the bear stearns and bref debt were outstanding and the senior secured notes were also outstanding 
this additional interest expense related to the day notice period  which will be recognized during the first quarter of  totaled approximately million 
o approximately million will be recognized as a gain on extinguishment of debt  primarily due to the reversal of accrued extension fees on the exit debt 
o approximately million of expenses will be recognized related to severance and related payments  and accelerated vesting of stock options for our former chairman  william b 
dockser  and former president  h 
william willoughby  whose employment contracts were terminated on january  in addition to the income statement items described above  transaction costs currently estimated to be approximately million related to the recapitalization will be included on the consolidated balance sheet as of march  such costs will be allocated between debt and equity 
the costs allocated to debt will be amortized using the effective interest method over the lives of the related debt 
the costs allocated to equity will be reflected in equity net of the proceeds from the issuance of the common stock 
dividends other no cash dividends were paid to common shareholders in or unlike the exit debt  which significantly restricted the amount of cash dividends that could be paid  the bref and bear stearns debt permit the payment of cash dividends after the payment of required principal and interest on that debt 
other factors which could impact dividends  if any  include i the level of income earned on uninsured mortgage assets  such as subordinated cmbs including  but not limited to  the amount of original issue discount income  interest shortfalls and losses on subordinated cmbs  ii net operating losses  iii the fluctuating yields on short term  variable rate debt and the rate at which our libor based debt is priced  as well as the rate we pay on our other borrowings and fluctuations in long term interest rates  iv changes in operating expenses  including hedging costs  v margin calls  vi the level of income earned on our insured mortgage securities depending primarily on prepayments and defaults  vii the rate at which cash flows from mortgage assets  mortgage dispositions  and  to the extent applicable  distributions from our subsidiaries can be reinvested  viii cash dividends paid on preferred shares  ix to the extent applicable  whether our taxable mortgage pools continue to be exempt from corporate level taxes  x realized losses on certain transactions  and xi the timing and amounts of cash flows attributable to our other lines of business mortgage servicing and other fee income

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements  and update those estimates as necessary 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals  and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our most critical accounting estimates a critical accounting policy being one that is both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments include the determination of fair value of our subordinated cmbs and interest income recognition related to our subordinated cmbs 
o fair value of subordinated cmbs due to the limited liquidity of the subordinated cmbs market and the resulting lack of a secondary market  we estimate the values of our subordinated cmbs internally 
these estimates require significant judgment regarding assumptions for defaults on the underlying commercial mortgage loan collateral  timing of loss realization and resultant loss severity and discount rates 
note to notes to consolidated financial statements contains a detailed discussion of the methodology used to determine the fair value of our subordinated cmbs as well as a sensitivity analysis related to the fair value of these subordinated cmbs due to changes in assumptions related to losses on the underlying commercial mortgage loan collateral and discount rates 
o interest income recognition related to subordinated cmbs interest income recognition under eitf no 
requires us to make estimates regarding expected prepayment speeds as well as expected losses on the underlying commercial mortgage loan collateral which directly impact the cash flows on our subordinated cmbs in the form of interest shortfalls and loss of principal and the impact these factors would have on future cash flow 
note to notes to consolidated financial statements details the expected realized losses by year that we expect to incur related to our subordinated cmbs 
the cash flows we project to arrive at the effective interest rate to recognize interest income are adjusted for these expected losses 
the judgment regarding future expected credit losses is subjective as credit performance is particular to an individual deal s specific underlying commercial mortgage loan collateral 
in general  if we increase our expected losses or determine such losses will occur sooner than previously projected and the cmbs s fair value is below cost  then the cmbs will be considered impaired and adjusted to fair value with the impairment charge recorded through earnings

we adopted the provisions related to the rescission of sfas no 
on april  as a result  we have reclassified a million gain on debt extinguishment in from an extraordinary item to an operating item 
in addition  in  we expect to recognize a gain on extinguishment of debt as a result of the retirement of the exit debt following the recapitalization in january the gain will be classified as an operating item 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no

the new standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the statement is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no

the interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we do not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates related to the us treasury market as well as the libor market 
we will have fluctuations in the amount of interest expense paid on our variable rate debt primarily due to changes in one month libor 
we will also experience fluctuations in the market value of our mortgage assets related to changes in the yields of us treasury securities as well as changes in the spread between us treasury securities and the mortgage assets 
the combination of the risk free rate us treasury yields and the related spread is the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our mortgage assets 
the us treasury yield used to determine the fair value of our mortgage assets is the current yield on a us treasury which has the same weighted average life of the related mortgage asset 
as of december   the average us treasury rate used to price our cmbs  excluding the ccc and unrated issuer s equity cmbs  had decreased by approximately basis points and credit spreads had tightened on certain cmbs compared to december  the fair values of our b and ccc cmbs in cbo and our unrated issuer s equity are determined using a loss adjusted yield to maturity  which is commensurate with the market s perception of value and risk of comparable assets 
as described  interest rates impact the fair values of our cmbs  which affects our collateral coverage 
see item business borrowing and refinancing risks for a discussion of our collateral coverage requirements under the bear stearns debt 
we have changed our method of presenting market risk disclosures from those disclosures presented in the december  annual report on form k 
we believe that the market risk disclosures presented below provide more meaningful information to our shareholders in assessing the affect of changes in interest rates on the values of our assets and the interest expense on our variable rate debt 
insured mortgage securities as of december   the weighted average life of the us treasury securities that were used to value the insured mortgage securities were significantly shorter than those used at december  due to lower market interest rates and other loan attributes of the underlying insured mortgage securities  which made the likelihood of the mortgage securities prepaying greater than the previous year 
if we assumed that the discount rate used to determine the fair values of our insured mortgage securities increased by basis points and basis points  the increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the fair values of our insured mortgage securities by approximately  or and approximately  or  respectively  as of december  a basis point and basis point increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the fair values of our insured mortgage securities by approximately million or and approximately million or  respectively  as of december  cmbs the required rate of return used to determine the fair values of our cmbs is comprised of many variables  such as a risk free rate  a liquidity premium and a credit risk premium 
these variables are combined to determine a total rate that  when used to discount the cmbs s assumed stream of future cash flows  results in the fair value of such cash flows 
the determination of such rate is dependent on many quantitative and qualitative factors  such as  but not limited to  the market s perception of the issuers of the cmbs and the credit fundamentals of the commercial properties underlying each underlying pool of commercial mortgage loans 
if we assumed that the discount rate used to determine the fair values of our cmbs a through unrated bonds increased by basis points and basis points  the increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the fair values of our cmbs a through unrated bonds by approximately million or and approximately million or  respectively  as of december  a basis point and basis point increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the fair values of our cmbs a through unrated bonds by approximately million or and million or  respectively  as of december  a basis point and basis point increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the value of our subordinated cmbs bb through unrated bonds by approximately million or and or  respectively  as of december  a basis point and basis point increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a corresponding decrease in the value of our subordinated cmbs bb through unrated bonds by approximately million or and million or  respectively  as of december  see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of other factors that could affect the fair values of our cmbs  including changes in the timing and or amount of credit losses on underlying mortgage loans  the receipt of mortgage payments earlier than projected due to prepayments  and delays in the receipt of monthly cash flow distributions on cmbs due to mortgage loan defaults and or extensions in loan maturities 
variable rate debt we have interest rate caps to mitigate the adverse effects of rising interest rates on the amount of interest expense payable under our variable rate debt 
in april  we purchased an interest rate cap 
this interest rate cap  which was effective on may   is for a notional amount of million  caps libor at  and matures on november  the cap was purchased for approximately million 
our caps provide protection to the extent interest rates  based on a readily determinable interest rate index typically one month libor  increase above the stated interest rate cap  in which case  we will receive payments based on the difference between the index and the caps 
the terms of the caps as well as the stated interest rates of the caps  which in all cases are currently above the current rate of the index  will limit the amount of protection that the caps offer 
the average one month libor index was during the year ended december   which was a basis point decrease from december  a basis point change in the one month libor index would have changed our interest expense on our exit variable rate secured borrowing by approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of march   a basis point change would change our annual interest expense on the bear stearns debt by approximately million
