upon the adoption of sfas no 
on january   the company recognized an impairment loss of approximately million related to its distribution reporting unit 
prior to the sale of stepic in september  the company had identified two reporting units  the aforementioned manufacturing unit and the distribution unit 
these reporting units were consistent with the company s previously identified reportable segments under sfas in applying the transitional impairment model prescribed by sfas  the company used a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the net assets of each of the company s reporting units 
significant assumptions utilized in the model were revenue growth rates  gross margin percentages  depreciation and amortization  capital expenditures  working capital requirements  and the appropriate discount rate 
the fair value of the company s distribution reporting unit s net assets were less than the carrying value of those net assets  thus  the company proceeded to step of the sfas impairment model  whereby the company allocated that fair value to the reporting unit s tangible and intangible net assets 
the company utilized various methods to determine the fair value of the distribution unit s identifiable intangible assets  including discounted cash flows  royalty savings method  and the cost approach 
significant assumptions used in valuing these intangible assets included price premiums  expected effective tax rates  the discount rate  remaining useful lives of intangible assets  royalty rates  and residual values 
a comparison of the implied fair value of goodwill  calculated from the allocation of fair value described above  to the carrying net book value of goodwill at january  yielded the impairment charge described above 
the company applied the same methodology to its manufacturing unit and concluded that the goodwill associated with that reporting unit was not impaired

impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million impairment charge related to the intangible assets of the company s ifm product line 
this charge writes the ifm long lived assets down to the fair value of management s expected cash flows 
interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased approximately  or from million in to million in the decrease is due to a decrease in interest rates as well as lower debt outstanding during of approximately million at the end of versus approximately million outstanding at the end of the reduction in debt was the result of proceeds generated from the sale of the ifm business  payments under the forbearance agreement with bank of america as well as payments under the working capital loan pursuant to the sweep arrangement with bank of america

recently issued accounting standards note of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k describes the recently issued accounting standards and  where applicable  the effects of such standards on the company 
impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuation the results of the company s operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations 
the loan agreement costs result primarily from interest and principal and are not affected by inflation 
further  although the company often sells products on an agreed upon price basis  the average time between the receipt of any order and delivery is generally only a few days 
while the company has not historically been adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials and components  certain group purchasing agreements to which the company is a party and other agreements with individual customers limit or restrict the company s ability to raise prices without advance written notice or only after certain time periods have elapsed under the agreements 
thus  future increases in the cost of raw materials and components could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
this could change in situations in which the company is producing against a substantial backlog and may not be able to pass on higher costs to customers 
in addition  interest on substantially all of the company s debt is variable and therefore may increase with inflation 
the company makes all sales to foreign customers in us dollars 
thus  notwithstanding fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates  the company s profit margin for any purchase order is not subject to change due to exchange rate fluctuations after the time the order is placed 
risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks not presently known to the company or which the company currently considers immaterial also may adversely affect the company 
if any of the following risks and uncertainties actually occur  the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company s cash flow from operations and cash available from external financing will be sufficient to meet its future cash flow needs  in which case the company would need to obtain additional financing 
as of december   the company had borrowing capacity of approximately million under its credit facility with lasalle 
any additional financing the company undertakes could involve issuances of debt or issuances of equity securities which would be dilutive to the company s shareholders  and any debt facilities could contain covenants that may affect the company s operations  including the company s ability to make future acquisitions 
adequate additional funds  whether from the financial markets or from other sources  may not be available on a timely basis  on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
insufficient funds may cause the company difficulty in financing its accounts receivables and inventory and may result in delay or abandonment of some or all of the company s product development  licensing  marketing or research and development programs or opportunities  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
additionally  the company is required to make periodic interest and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness  including the convertible notes  the lasalle credit facility and the junior note 
failure to make any such required payments may result in an event of default and the acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness 

table of contents the company s inability to introduce new products to the marketplace could adversely impact its operating results 
although the vascular access product industry has not experienced rapid technological change historically  as the company s existing products become more mature  the importance of developing or acquiring  manufacturing and introducing new products that address the needs of its customers will increase 
the development or acquisition of any such products will entail considerable time and expense  including acquisition costs  research and development costs  and the time and expense required to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  which approvals are not assured  and any of which could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that such development activities will yield products that can be commercialized profitably or that any product acquisition can be consummated on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
historically  many of the company s products have been developed in conjunction with third parties or acquired as a result of acquisitions consummated by the company 
recently  the company has introduced new products developed by the company 
the company s inability to develop or acquire new products to supplement its existing product lines could have an adverse impact on the company s ability to fully implement its business strategy and further develop its operations 
the company has limited manufacturing experience and it can not assure that it will successfully complete the development and manufacture of products integral to the company s business 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to manufacture its products in compliance with international and domestic standards such as iso  the fda s good manufacturing practices  or gmp  regulations and other applicable licensing and regulatory requirements in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis  while maintaining product quality and acceptable manufacturing costs 
the company has historically outsourced the manufacturing of most of its product lines to third parties while remaining responsible for that work but  since and in subsequent years  has transitioned the manufacturing of the company s products to the manchester facility 
in the fourth quarter of  the company transitioned the manufacturing of the company s circle c and pheres flow specialty catheter product lines into the company s manufacturing facility in manchester  georgia 
during  the company transitioned the manufacturing of its lifeport  infuse a port and infuse a cath product lines to the manchester facility from a facility in norwood  massachusetts 
during  the company transitioned the manufacturing of the vortex port  titanport and omegaport product lines to the manchester facility from norfolk medical 
in and  the company transitioned the manufacturing of the triumph port line to the manchester facility from act medical as well as its infusion sets which had previously been manufactured by a third party 
the company has undergone and expects to continue to undergo regular gmp inspections in connection with the manufacture of its products at the company s facilities 
the company s success will depend  among other things  on its ability to efficiently manufacture different products and to integrate newly developed products with existing products 
the company s failure to successfully commence the manufacturing of new products  to maintain or increase production volumes of new or existing products in a timely or cost effective manner or to maintain compliance with iso  the ce mark requirements  gmp regulations or other applicable licensing or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company must maintain its current third party manufacturing relationships  and be able to successfully establish new relationships  in order for the company s business to be successful 
while the company believes it has a good relationship with each third party that manufactures certain components for the company s products  there can be no assurance that such relationships will not deteriorate in the future 
deterioration in these manufacturing relationships could cause us to experience interruptions in the company s manufacturing and delivery processes and have a material adverse impact on its business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  when the arrangements with these third parties expire  the company will have to make other manufacturing arrangements or manufacture products or product parts 
table of contents at its facilities 
the failure to effectively plan for the expiration of these agreements could also result in interruption of the manufacturing and delivery processes for these products and have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company relies on third party suppliers  the loss of which may interrupt its operations 
the company purchases raw materials and components for use in manufacturing its products from many different suppliers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its existing supplier relationships or secure additional suppliers as needed 
the loss of a major supplier  the deterioration of its relationship with a major supplier  changes by a major supplier in the specifications of the components used in its products  or the company s failure to establish good relationships with major new suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company may fail to adequately protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights 
the company believes that its competitive position and success has depended  in part  on and will continue to depend on the ability of the company and its licensors to obtain patent protection for its products  to defend patents once obtained  to preserve its trade secrets and to operate without infringing upon patents and proprietary rights held by third parties  both in the united states and in foreign countries 
the company s policy is to protect its proprietary position by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications relating to technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of its business 
the company owns numerous united states and foreign patents and patent applications 
the company also is a party to license agreements with third parties pursuant to which it has obtained  for varying terms  the right to make  use and or sell products that are covered under such license agreements in consideration for royalty payments 
many of the company s products are subject to such license agreements 
there can be no assurance that the company or its licensors have or will develop or obtain additional rights to products or processes that are patentable  that patents will issue from any of the pending patent applications filed by us or that claims allowed will be sufficient to protect any technology that is licensed to the company 
in addition  no assurances can be given that any patents issued or licensed to the company or other licensing arrangements will not be challenged  invalidated  infringed or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages for the company s business or products 
in such event the company s business  financial condition  and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
asserting  defending and maintaining the company s patent rights could be difficult and costly and failure to do so may diminish the company s ability to compete effectively and may harm the company s operating results 
a number of medical device companies  physicians and others have filed patent applications or received patents to technologies that are similar to technologies owned or licensed by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company is aware of all patents or patent applications that may materially affect its ability to make  use or sell its products 
united states patent applications are confidential while pending in the united states patent and trademark office pto unless a foreign patent application related to the united states patent application is also filed  in which event the united states patent application is published months after the earliest priority date  and patent applications filed in foreign countries are often first published six or more months after filing 
any conflicts resulting from third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of the patents owned or licensed by the company and limit its ability of or its licensors ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
if patents are issued to other companies that contain competitive or conflicting claims  the company may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would not be delayed or prevented from pursuing the development or commercialization of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
although the company has not been a party to any material litigation to enforce any intellectual property rights held by the company  or a party to any material litigation seeking to enforce any 
table of contents rights alleged to be held by others  future litigation may be necessary to protect patents  trade secrets  copyrights or know how owned by the company or to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of the company and others 
the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by the company 
adverse determinations in any such litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  could require the company to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent the company from developing  manufacturing  selling or using certain of the company s products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company relies in part on confidentiality agreements to protect the company s proprietary technologies  and the company can not assure that these agreements will be effective 
the company relies on trade secrets and proprietary technology that the company seeks to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach  that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets 
the company relies on trademarks and trade names for the success of the company s business  and the loss of one or any of these marks or names could materially harm the company s business 
the company relies upon trademarks and trade names for the development and protection of brand loyalty and associated goodwill in connection with the company s products 
the company s policy is to protect its trademarks  trade names and associated goodwill by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign trademark applications relating to the company s products and business 
the company owns numerous united states and foreign trademark registrations and applications 
the company also relies upon trademarks and trade names for which the company does not have pending trademark applications or existing registrations  but in which the company has substantial trademark rights 
the company s registered and unregistered trademark rights relate to the majority of its products 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names will not be challenged  canceled  infringed  circumvented  or be declared generic or infringing of other third party marks or provide any competitive advantage to the company 
the company is potentially subject to product liability claims resulting from the operation of its business  and the company can not assure that it will not incur losses associated with such claims 
because the company s products are intended to be used in healthcare settings on patients who are physiologically unstable and may be seriously or critically ill  the company s business exposes the company to potential product liability risks which are inherent in the medical device industry 
in addition  many of the medical devices manufactured and sold by the company are designed to be implanted in the human body for extended periods of time 
component failures  manufacturing flaws  design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks with respect to these or other products manufactured or sold by the company could result in injury to  or death of  a patient 
the occurrence of such a problem could result in product liability claims and or a recall of  safety alert relating to  or other fda or private civil action affecting one or more of the company s products or responsible officials 
the company maintains product liability insurance coverage in amounts that the company deems sufficient for the company s business 
there can be no assurance  however  that such coverage will be available with respect to or sufficient to satisfy all claims made against the company or that the company will be able to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
product liability claims or product recalls in the future  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could result in costly litigation and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the company initiated a voluntary product recall of the company s dialysis and central venous catheter kit product lines due to small pinholes in the product 
table of contents packaging 
although the recall covers products manufactured since  product returns through december  were approximately  units 
no product complaints have been received to date for either pinholes in the packaging or infection of the implant site that could be attributed to the packaging being contaminated 
in  the recall was terminated by the fda 
the company s executive officers and directors  together with parties to the recapitalization  will have the ability to exercise control over the company 
as of the date of this filing  comvest venture partners  lp and affiliated entities thereof  collectively own approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
additionally  the additional note purchasers have collectively converted their convertible notes into approximately of the company s outstanding common stock as a percentage of common stock outstanding on the date of this filing 
further  medtronic has the right to convert a portion of its unconverted convertible notes into up to million additional shares of the company s common stock representing of the company s common stock after  and as if  giving effect to such conversion subject to the terms and conditions contained therein 
messrs 
hunt and peterson  both officers and directors of the company  collectively own approximately of the company s outstanding common stock as of the date of this filing 
if certain of comvest  medtronic  the additional note purchasers and or messrs 
hunt and peterson were to act together  they would have the power to elect all of the members of the company s board of directors  amend the company s restated and amended articles of incorporation and the company s bylaws  and effect or preclude fundamental corporate transactions involving the company  including the acceptance or rejection of proposals relating to a merger or the acquisition of the company by another entity 
accordingly  these shareholders are able to exert significant influence over the company 
the company s sales are concentrated among a small number of significant customers  the loss of any of which may have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s net sales to its three largest customers accounted for  and of total sales excluding discontinued operations of the stepic distribution segment  which was sold in september during  and  respectively 
the loss of  or significant curtailments of purchases by  any of the company s significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s cash flows will be adversely affected by its recent sale of stepic 
on september   the company sold substantially all of the assets of stepic  its distribution division 
for the fiscal year ended december   the company s distribution division accounted for of its total sales and of its gross profit  and for the nine months ended september   the company s distribution division accounted for of its total sales and of its gross profit 
the company anticipates that its sale of stepic will substantially reduce its cash flow from its historical level for the foreseeable future 
the company cannot assure that in the future its cash flow from operations will be sufficient to allow the company to fully execute on the company s strategic plan  including research and development related to new products 
this loss of cash flow may materially adversely affect the company s liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is dependent upon key personnel  the loss of any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business 
the company s success is substantially dependent on the performance  contributions and expertise of its executive officers and key employees 
the company s success to date has been significantly dependent on the contributions of marshall b 
hunt  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  william e 
peterson  jr  the company s president  and robert j 
wenzel  the company s chief operating officer each of whom is party to an employment agreement with the company and  with respect to messrs

the employment agreements for mr 
hunt  mr 
peterson and mr 
wenzel expire on april   december  
table of contents and december   respectively 
the company is also dependent on its ability to attract  retain and motivate additional personnel 
the loss of the services of any of the company s executive officers or other key employees or the company s inability to attract  retain or motivate the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s business is subject to changes in the regulatory and economic environment in the healthcare industry  which could adversely affect the company s business 
the healthcare industry in the united states continues to experience change 
in recent years  several healthcare reform proposals have been formulated by members of congress 
in addition  state legislatures periodically consider healthcare reform proposals 
federal  state and local government representatives will  in all likelihood  continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies  and ongoing public debate of these issues can be expected 
cost containment initiatives  market pressures and proposed changes in applicable laws and regulations may have a dramatic effect on pricing or potential demand for medical devices  the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and third party payors to persons providing medical services 
in particular  the healthcare industry is experiencing market driven reforms from forces within the industry that are exerting pressure on healthcare companies to reduce healthcare costs 
managed care and other healthcare provider organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population in the united states that receives medical benefits through such organizations and in terms of the influence and control that they are able to exert over an increasingly large portion of the healthcare industry 
managed care organizations are continuing to consolidate and grow  increasing the ability of these organizations to influence the practices and pricing involved in the purchase of medical devices  including certain of the products sold by the company  which is expected to exert downward pressure on product margins 
both short and long term cost containment pressures  as well as the possibility of continued regulatory reform  may have an adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company is subject to government regulation in the united states and internationally  which can be time consuming and costly to the company s business 
the company s products and operations are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities  including  but not limited to  the fda and state and foreign governmental authorities 
in particular  the company must obtain specific clearance or approval from the fda before it can market new products or certain modified products in the united states 
the fda administers the fdc act 
under the fdc act  most medical devices must receive fda clearance through the section k notification process k or the more lengthy premarket approval pma process before they can be sold in the united states 
to obtain k marketing clearance  a company must show that a new product is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a product already legally marketed and which does not require a pma 
therefore  it is not always necessary to prove the actual safety and effectiveness of the new product in order to obtain k clearance for such product 
to obtain a pma  a company must submit extensive data  including clinical trial data  to prove the safety  effectiveness and clinical utility of the company s products 
the process of obtaining such clearances or approvals can be time consuming and expensive  and there can be no assurance that all clearances or approvals sought by the company will be granted or that fda review will not involve delays adversely affecting the marketing and sale of the company s products 
fda s quality system regulations also require companies to adhere to certain good manufacturing practices requirements  which include testing  quality control  storage  and documentation procedures 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic site inspections by the fda 
in addition  the company is required to comply with fda requirements for labeling and promotion of the company s products 
the federal trade commission also regulates most device advertising 
in addition  international regulatory bodies often establish varying regulations governing product testing and licensing standards  manufacturing compliance  such as compliance with iso standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements and pricing and reimbursement levels 
the company s inability or failure to comply with the varying regulations or 
table of contents the imposition of new regulations could restrict the company s ability to sell its products internationally and thereby adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
failure to comply with applicable federal  state or foreign laws or regulations could subject the company to enforcement actions  including  but not limited to  product seizures  injunctions  recalls  possible withdrawal of product clearances  civil penalties and criminal prosecutions against the company or its responsible officials  any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
federal  state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future changes  as are administrative interpretations of regulatory requirements 
no assurance can be given that such changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
from time to time  the company has received a form fda and warning letters from the fda regarding the company s compliance with fda regulations 
on september   at the conclusion of the fda s inspection of the company s facility in manchester  georgia  the company received a form fda letter specifying five items 
the company has responded to such observations 
the company has worked with the fda to resolve these observations 
there can be no assurance the company will not receive additional form fda s or warning letters in the future or that the company will be able to reach an acceptable resolution of the issues raised in such letters 
the company s operations are subject to the regulations imposed by the anti kickback statute 
the company s operations are subject to the rules and regulations imposed by the anti kickback statute 
the anti kickback statute has been interpreted broadly by some courts  the office of inspector general within the department of health and human services  and administrative bodies 
a violation of the anti kickback statute is a felony  punishable by fine  imprisonment or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid or other applicable federal healthcare programs 
despite the fact that there exist certain safe harbors from governmental investigation under the anti kickback statute  practices that does not fall within a safe harbor may be subject to challenge by the department of health and human services and a violation of the anti kickback statute may occur even if only one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases reimbursable by a federal health care program 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to any such litigation or additional investigation in the future  which could be time consuming and costly to the company  and divert management s attention from operating the company s business  each or any outcome of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business and financial condition 
the company s business is dependent upon reimbursement from government programs  such as medicare and medicaid  and the company may face limitations on such third party reimbursement  which could harm the company s operating results 
in the united states  the company s products are purchased primarily by hospitals and medical clinics  which then bill various third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans  for the healthcare services provided to patients 
government agencies  private insurers and other payors determine whether to provide coverage for a particular procedure and reimburse hospitals for medical treatment at a fixed rate based on the diagnosis related group  or drg  established by the united states centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms 
the fixed rate of reimbursement is based on the procedure performed and is unrelated to the specific devices used in that procedure 
if a procedure is not covered by a drg  payors may deny reimbursement 
in addition  third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in a treatment was unnecessary  inappropriate or not cost effective  experimental or used for a non approved indication 
reimbursement of procedures implanting the company s vascular access ports and catheter products is currently covered under a drg 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such implantation will continue to be available  or that future reimbursement policies of third party payors will not adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
failure by hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain reimbursement from third party payors  or changes in government and private 
table of contents third party payors policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing the company s products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition
