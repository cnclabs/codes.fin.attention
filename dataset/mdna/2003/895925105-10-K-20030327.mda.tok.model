item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations compared to net income for increased to million from million in net income per share on a diluted basis increased to for from per share for this improvement in net income was led by a increase in earned premiums and a increase in net investment income 
net income for includes net realized investment losses of million  or per diluted share  while net income for included net realized investment gains of  or per diluted share 
also included in net income for was the receipt of a nonrecurring incentive payment of approximately million  or per diluted share  relating to the voluntary cancellation of one of the company s excess of loss reinsurance contracts 
the payment was reported as other income in the first quarter of operating earnings  which exclude realized investment gains and losses net of related taxes  increased to million in compared to million in operating earnings per share were for compared to for  an increase of 
management believes operating earnings and operating earnings per share are relevant and useful information  and they are primary measurements used by management in assessing the company s performance 
management does not believe that net realized investment gains and losses are strong indicators of trends in operations 
operating earnings and operating earnings per share results  as described above  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
excluding the effects of the nonrecurring incentive payment from operating results  operating earnings increased  and operating earnings per diluted share increased approximately for compared to total insurance written in was billion compared to billion in  an increase of 
total insurance written includes insurance written from traditional flow production and insurance written attributable to structured bulk transactions 
total direct insurance in force reached billion at december   compared to billion at december   an increase of 
significant refinance activity in drove a high level of policy cancellations that partially offset the impact that the high level of insurance written had on in force growth 
traditional flow insurance written for increased to billion from billion in the increase in insurance written from traditional flow production was primarily the result of expanding relationships with national lenders  strong demand for risk sharing arrangements  and a lower interest rate environment 
insurance written in attributable to structured bulk transactions totaled billion compared to billion in structured bulk transactions are generally initiated by secondary mortgage market participants who wish to use mortgage insurance as a credit enhancement 
the company competes against other mortgage insurers as well as other forms of credit enhancements provided by capital markets for these transactions 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued insurance written attributed to structured bulk transactions is likely to vary significantly from period to period due to the relatively small number of transactions that encompass this market as opposed to the traditional flow market  competitiveness with other mortgage insurers  the attractiveness in the marketplace of mortgage insurance versus other forms of credit enhancements  and the changing loan composition of the market 
the company has evaluated all segments of the bulk market prime predominantly fully underwritten loans  high credit scores  high percentage of low ltvs  alternative a generally high credit score  low to moderate ltv loans that have been underwritten with reduced documentation  and sub prime generally fully underwritten loans with credit impaired borrowers 
all insurance written through the bulk channel in and was in the prime segment and the alternative a segment of the bulk market 
consolidation within the mortgage origination industry and triad s continued focus on national lenders has resulted in a greater percentage of production volume being concentrated among a smaller customer base 
the company s ten largest customers were responsible for   and of traditional flow risk in force at december    and  respectively 
the loss of one or more of these significant customers could have a significant adverse effect on the company s business 
according to industry data  triad s national market share of net new primary insurance written  which includes insurance written on a traditional flow basis as well as that attributed to structured bulk transactions  was for for the fourth quarter compared to for for the fourth quarter 
triad s national market share of net new primary insurance written on a traditional flow basis was for for the fourth quarter compared to for in the fourth quarter 
net new primary insurance written excludes insurance placed on loans more than months after loan origination  insurance placed on loans already covered by primary mortgage insurance  and insurance placed on loans where lender exposure is effectively reduced below defined minimums 
this treatment is consistent with the definitions adopted by the company and the industry in the third quarter of regarding the computation of new insurance written for market share purposes 
total direct premiums written were million for  an increase of compared to million for net premiums written increased by to million in from million for earned premiums increased to million for from million for this growth in written and earned premium resulted from record levels of insurance written offset by the impact of a declining persistency rate due to a high level of refinance activity 
growth in direct premiums written was partially offset by an increase in ceded premiums written 
driven primarily by increases in risk sharing arrangements and also by excess of loss reinsurance  ceded premiums written increased to million in from million in the company s premium cede rate the ratio of ceded premiums written to direct premiums written was for compared to for the company s premium cede rate for captive reinsurance was for compared to for approximately of flow insurance written of total insurance item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued written including structured bulk transactions during is subject to captive mortgage reinsurance and other risk sharing arrangements compared to of flow insurance written of total insurance written including structured bulk transactions in the decline in the percentage of flow insurance written subject to risk sharing arrangements from to is primarily a result of increased production in the company s lender paid mortgage insurance program which is generally not subject to risk sharing arrangements 
through december   insurance written attributable to structured bulk transactions has not been subject to captive mortgage reinsurance or other risk sharing arrangements 
approximately of direct insurance in force is subject to risk sharing arrangements at december   compared to at december  this increase in insurance in force subject to risk sharing arrangements is due primarily to the increased market penetration of the company s risk sharing arrangements and the high level of refinance activity during the past twelve months  as policies that were previously not subject to risk sharing arrangements refinanced and new policies issued were subject to risk sharing arrangements 
management anticipates that ceded premiums will continue to increase as a result of the expected increase in insurance written and growth in the company s risk sharing programs 
the company currently participates in excess of loss risk sharing arrangements with various entrance and exit attachment points 
one of the company s competitors has announced that as of march   it will not participate in excess of loss risk sharing arrangements where the net premium cede rate is greater than 
the company believes that its risk sharing arrangements provide valuable reinsurance protection and potentially reduce the risk of volatility in the company s earnings 
the company plans to continue to participate in its excess of loss risk sharing arrangements 
it is uncertain at this time what impact  if any  the competitor s decision to exit this business will have on the company s direct insurance in force subject to risk sharing arrangements and its market share 
refinance activity was of insurance written in the fourth quarter in compared to in the fourth quarter in excluding structured bulk transactions  refinance activity was of insurance written in the fourth quarter in compared to of insurance written in the fourth quarter in persistency  or the percentage of insurance in force remaining from one year prior  was at december   compared to at december  the high level of refinance activity and the resulting decrease in persistency is reflective of the low interest rate environment that has been in place during the past year 
low persistency results in an acceleration of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and a reduction in renewal premiums 
the annualized quarterly persistency run rate for the fourth quarter of was compared to for the fourth quarter of the company defines persistency as the percentage of insurance in force remaining from months prior 
run off  defined as cancelled or terminated policies  of production originated during the past months is not considered in the company s calculation of persistency 
the company calculates persistency item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued by determining the run off over the prior months of each individual policy year exclusive of current year production 
this method of calculating persistency may vary from that of other mortgage insurers 
the company believes that its calculation presents an accurate measure of the percentage of insurance in force remaining from months prior 
the company s current method of calculating persistency is consistent with the methodology used by the company in prior years 
net investment income for was million  a increase over million in this increase is the result of growth in the average balance of invested assets by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the growth in invested assets is attributable to normal operating cash flow 
the pre tax yield on average invested assets decreased to for compared to for  reflecting the current low interest rate environment for new money investments and the disposal of a number of higher yielding corporate bonds with lower credit quality during the past twelve months to enhance the overall quality of the portfolio 
the portfolio s tax equivalent yield to maturity was at december   versus at december  based on fair value  approximately and of the company s fixed maturity portfolio at december  and  respectively  was composed of state and municipal tax preferred securities 
at december   based on fair value  approximately of the company s fixed maturity portfolio was either a us government or us agency obligation or was rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized securities rating organization compared to approximately of the company s fixed maturity portfolio at december  the company actively monitors investment securities considered to be at risk for impairment 
when the company determines that a decline in the value of a security below its amortized cost is other than temporary  an impairment loss has occurred 
in the event of impairment  the company writes down the cost basis of the security to its fair value and recognizes a realized loss for the amount of the writedown 
net realized losses of million during included impairment writedowns of approximately million on securities held in the company s portfolio 
the net realized gain of  during the fourth quarter of included approximately  of impairment writedowns 
the writedowns primarily involved securities in the telecommunications and technology sectors and  to a lesser degree  the airline  energy  electronic manufacturing  and textile manufacturing industries 
net losses and loss adjustment expenses net of reinsurance recoveries increased by in to million from million in the rise reflects an increase in paid losses and delinquent loans as the company s insurance in force grows and the condition of the economy remains weak 
net paid losses and loss adjustment expenses increased to million during from million during reported delinquent loans totaled  at december   compared to  at december   an increase of 
the delinquency inventory count includes all reported delinquencies that are three or more payments in arrears at the reporting date and all reported delinquencies item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued that were previously three or more payments in arrears and have not made payments to the current due date 
reserves are established for all insured loans reported as delinquent to the company by the loan servicer 
the company s loss ratio the ratio of net incurred losses to net earned premiums was for compared to for the loss ratio was for the fourth quarter of and for the fourth quarter of as of december   approximately of the company s insurance in force was originated in the last months 
management believes  based upon its experience and industry data  that claims incidence for it and other private mortgage insurers is generally highest in the third through sixth years after loan origination 
although the claims experience on insurance written in previous years has been quite favorable  management does not expect losses to remain at the low levels currently reported 
the company expects its incurred losses to increase as a greater amount of its insurance in force reaches its anticipated highest claim frequency years 
furthermore  changes in the economic environment could accelerate paid and incurred loss development 
due to the inherent uncertainty of future premium levels  losses  economic conditions  and other factors that affect earnings  it is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the impact of such higher claim frequencies on future earnings 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased by to million in from million for the increase in amortization reflects growth in deferred policy acquisition costs related to the growth of the company s insurance in force and accelerated amortization due to higher cancellations from refinance activity in the company s model calculates the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs separately for each book year 
the model accelerates the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs through a dynamic adjustment when persistency for a book year is lower than a historical baseline level in order to match the amortization expense with the life of the policies on which the acquisition costs were originally deferred 
low persistency levels during the past two years resulted in additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs through dynamic adjustments totaling million in and million in other operating expenses increased to million for from million for this increase in expenses is primarily attributable to personnel  technology amortization  and equipment and software costs required to support the company s increased levels of production  product development  system enhancements  and geographic expansion 
the expense ratio ratio of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses to net premiums written for was compared to for the effective tax rate was for both and management expects the company s effective tax rate to remain at about the same annual rate as long as yields from new funds invested in tax preferred securities remain favorable in relation to fully taxable securities 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued compared to net income for increased to million from million in this improvement was led by a increase in earned premiums and a increase in net investment income 
net income for also included the receipt of a nonrecurring payment of approximately million related to the voluntary cancellation of an excess of loss reinsurance contract 
the payment was reported as other income in the first quarter of net income per share on a diluted basis increased to for from per share for operating earnings per share were for compared to for  an increase of 
operating earnings per share exclude approximately  of net realized investment gains in and  in operating earnings in include approximately per share related to the nonrecurring payment 
insurance written for was billion compared to billion in  an increase of 
traditional flow production was billion in compared to billion in  an increase of 
the increase in insurance written from traditional flow production was driven primarily by new and expanding relationships with national lenders  strong demand for risk sharing arrangements  and a lower interest rate environment which increased refinance activity and overall mortgage origination activity 
insurance written for also included approximately billion attributable to structured bulk transactions 
for the comparable period of  there was no insurance written attributable to these transactions 
according to industry data  triad s national market share of net new primary insurance written increased to for all of from for all of total direct insurance in force reached billion at december   compared to billion at december   an increase of 
total direct premiums written were million for  an increase of compared to million for net premiums written increased by to million in from million for earned premiums increased to million for from million for this growth in written and earned premium resulted from record levels of insurance written offset by the impact of a declining persistency rate due to a high level of mortgage refinancings 
growth in direct premiums written was partially offset by the increase in ceded premiums written 
driven primarily by increases in risk sharing arrangements and also by excess of loss reinsurance  ceded premiums written increased to million from million in the company s premium cede rate the ratio of ceded premiums written to direct premiums written was for compared to for approximately of insurance written excluding bulk transactions during was subject to captive mortgage reinsurance and other risk sharing arrangements compared to of insurance written in refinance activity was of insurance written in compared to in persistency  or the amount of insurance in force remaining from one year prior  was at december   compared to at december  the increase in refinance activity and the decrease in persistency were reflective of the low interest rate environment during net investment income for was million  a increase over million in this increase was the result of growth in the average balance of invested assets by million to million for  from item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued million for the growth in invested assets was attributable to normal operating cash flow 
the pre tax yield on average invested assets decreased to for as compared to for all of  reflecting the low interest rate environment during the portfolio s tax equivalent yield to maturity was at december   versus at december  based on fair value  approximately of the company s fixed maturity portfolio at december   was composed of state and municipal tax preferred securities as compared to approximately at december  at december   based on fair value  approximately of the company s fixed maturity portfolio was either a us government or us agency obligation or was rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized securities rating organization compared to approximately of the company s fixed maturity portfolio at december  in the first quarter of  the company recognized a nonrecurring incentive payment of approximately million related to voluntary cancellation of an excess of loss reinsurance contract maintained by the company with a non affiliated reinsurer 
this payment was accounted for as other income 
the company also established excess of loss reinsurance coverage through a separate third party reinsurer in the first quarter of under terms similar to the cancelled agreement 
net losses and loss adjustment expenses net of reinsurance recoveries increased by in to million from million in this rise reflected increased levels of insurance in force 
the company s loss ratio was for compared to for as of december   there were no incurred losses related to the company s bulk business 
approximately of the company s insurance in force at december   was originated in the prior months 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased by to million in from million for the increase in amortization reflected growth in deferred policy acquisition costs related to the expansion of the company s insurance in force and accelerated amortization due to higher cancellations from refinance activity in other operating expenses increased to million for from million for this increase in expenses was primarily attributable to personnel  technology amortization  and equipment costs required to support the company s product development  system enhancements  and expanded production 
the expense ratio for was compared to for the effective tax rate for was compared to in the increase in the effective tax rate was due to a lower percentage of pre tax income being generated from tax preferred securities as well as the recognition  on a taxable basis  of previously deferred income 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of operating funds consist primarily of premiums written and investment income 
operating cash flow is applied primarily to the payment of claims  interest  expenses  and taxes 
the company generated positive cash flow from operating activities for of million compared to million for and million for the increase in cash flow from operating activities in reflects the growth in premium and investment income and the effects of tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options offset partially by the increase in underwriting expenses and losses paid 
the company s business does not routinely require significant capital expenditures other than for enhancements to its computer systems and technological capabilities 
positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of claims and expenses 
cash flow shortfalls  if any  could be funded through sales of short term investments and other investment portfolio securities 
the parent company s cash flow is dependent on interest income and payments from triad including management fees and interest payments under surplus notes 
the illinois insurance department permits expenses of the parent company to be reimbursed by triad in the form of management fees 
payment of dividends is also permitted  although none have been paid to date 
the insurance laws of the state of illinois impose certain restrictions on dividends that triad can pay the parent company 
these restrictions  based on statutory accounting practices  include requirements that dividends may be paid only out of statutory earned surplus and that limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the illinois insurance department 
consolidated invested assets were million at december   compared to million at december  fixed maturity securities and equity securities classified as available for sale totaled million at december  net unrealized investment gains were million on fixed maturity securities and net unrealized investment losses were  on equity securities at december  based on fair value  the fixed maturity portfolio consisted of approximately municipal securities  corporate securities  and us government obligations at december  at december   the fixed maturity portfolio consisted of approximately municipal securities  corporate securities  and us government obligations 
the weighted average duration to maturity of the company s fixed maturity portfolio was years at december   compared to years at december  this increase in duration was due to shifts in the portfolio from corporate securities to municipal securities  where the yield curve was more attractive on longer duration investments 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fixed maturity securities represented approximately of the company s invested assets at december   and the fair value of these fixed rate securities generally bears an inverse relationship to changes in prevailing market interest rates 
the company s long term debt bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum  and as a result  the fair value of this debt is sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates 
a relative increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect the company s financial instruments would not have a material impact on earnings during the next fiscal year  and would not materially affect the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
the company s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves increased to million at december   compared to million at december  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are established when notices of default on insured mortgage loans are received 
reserves also are established for estimated losses incurred on notices of default not yet reported by the lender 
consistent with industry practices  the company does not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans that are not currently in default 
the growth in loss reserves is the result of the increase in reported defaults and the maturing of the company s risk in force 
the company expects loss reserves to continue to grow  reflecting the growth and aging of its insurance in force 
including bulk loans  the company s delinquency ratio the ratio of delinquent insured loans to total insured loans was at december   compared to at december  the company s delinquency ratios for traditional flow and bulk loans were and  respectively  at december  there were no reported delinquencies for bulk loans at december  reserves are established by management using estimated claim rates frequency and claim amounts severity to estimate ultimate losses 
the reserving process incorporates numerous factors in a formula that gives effect to current economic conditions and profiles delinquencies by such factors as policy year  geography  chronic late payment characteristics  and the number of months the policy has been in default 
because the estimate for loss reserves is sensitive to the estimates of claims frequency and severity  management performs sensitivity analyses to test the reasonableness of the best estimate generated by the loss reserve process 
these sensitivity analyses allow management to use alternative assumptions related to claims frequency and claims severity to develop a range of reasonably possible loss reserve outcomes that can be used to challenge the best estimate 
the loss reserve estimation process and the sensitivity analyses support the reasonableness of the best estimate of loss reserves recorded as a liability in the financial statements 
management periodically reviews the loss reserve process in order to improve its estimate of ultimate losses on loans currently in default 
adjustments to reserve estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the periods in which the adjustments are made 
triad cedes business to captive reinsurance subsidiaries of certain mortgage lenders captives primarily under excess of loss reinsurance agreements 
generally  reinsurance recoverables on loss reserves and unearned premiums ceded to these captives are backed by trust funds or letters of credit 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued total stockholders equity increased to million at december   from million at december  this increase resulted primarily from net income of million  an increase in net unrealized gains on invested assets classified as available for sale of million net of income tax  and additional paid in capital of million resulting from the exercise of employee stock options and the related tax benefit 
triad s total statutory policyholders surplus increased to million at december   from million at december  triad s statutory earned surplus increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase in triad s statutory policyholders surplus and statutory earned surplus resulted  primarily  from statutory net income of million which exceeded the net increase in the statutory contingency reserve of million and the increase in the statutory deferred tax liability of million 
the balance in the statutory contingency reserve was million at december   compared to million at december  triad s ability to write insurance depends on the maintenance of its financial strength ratings and the adequacy of its capital in relation to risk in force 
a significant reduction of capital or a significant increase in risk may impair triad s ability to write additional insurance 
a number of states also generally limit triad s risk to capital ratio to to as of december   triad s risk to capital ratio was to as compared to to at december   and to for the industry as a whole at december   the latest industry data available 
triad is rated aa by both standard poor s ratings services and fitch ratings and aa by moody s investors service 
fannie mae is in the process of revising its approval requirements for mortgage insurers 
the new requirements  which have not yet been finalized  would require prior approval by fannie mae for many of triad s activities and new products  allow for other approved types of mortgage insurers rated less than aa  and give fannie mae increased rights to revise the eligibility standards of mortgage insurers 
the final form the eligibility guidelines will take is unknown at this time  but new guidelines  if issued  could have an adverse effect on the company 
the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo issued its risk based capital rules for fannie mae and freddie mac in the first quarter of the regulation provides capital guidelines for fannie mae and freddie mac in connection with their use of various types of credit protection counterparties including a more preferential capital credit for insurance from a aaa rated private mortgage insurer than for insurance from a aa rated private mortgage insurer 
the phase in period for the new rules is ten years 
the company does not believe the new rules had an adverse impact in nor item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued that the new rules will have a significant adverse impact on the company in the future 
however  if the new capital guidelines result in future changes to the preferences of fannie mae and freddie mac regarding their use of the various types of credit enhancements or their choice of mortgage insurers based on their credit rating  the company s financial condition could be significantly harmed
